<h3 id='chapter1'>Chapter 1: Abandoning Himself to Vice</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“After the dimensional storms decades ago, multiple dimensional zones appeared across the world—gods, immortals, ghosts, monsters, angels, devils, elves, etc. All kinds of legendary dimensional creatures were discovered. Via hunting these dimensional creatures, humans acquire their powers…” As the grizzled Yu Qiubai lectured, he would occasionally cast his gaze to the corner seat at the back of the classroom.</p>
<p>The other students were listening attentively, but the boy in the corner had his textbook in front of him while sleeping with his arm lay outstretched on the table. From time to time, one could hear faint snoring.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai shook his head indiscernibly as he sighed inwardly. So what if you are talented? What can you accomplish if you falter from a single setback? Although the setback from that failure was big, not recovering from it really doesn’t make him live up to the former principal’s approbation of him.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai recalled what the former principal had said to him before his retirement. Looking back at the boy sleeping soundly on the table with drool hanging from the corner of his lips, he couldn’t help but shake his head and sigh.</p>
<p>“Qiubai, I’ve seen many geniuses in my life. In summary, there are two types of geniuses.” The former principal back then had very bright eyes.</p>
<p>“What are the two types?” Yu Qiubai had asked curiously.</p>
<p>“One type of genius is called Zhou Wen, the other type is the other geniuses.”</p>
<p>The former principal’s words left a deep impression on Yu Qiubai, but the student who was given heaps of praises by the former principal was now a degenerate, one who had no intention of improving himself. All he did was sleep in class. After class, he would be gaming on his cellphone.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai had attempted to bolster Zhou Wen’s confidence in the past, hoping that he could rally him up. But despite the numerous pep talks, Zhou Wen remained the same. He continued sleeping in class and gaming out of class. He didn’t focus on cultivation as though he had lost all sense of enterprise.</p>
<p>Ring!</p>
<p>With the bell ringing to mark the end of class, Yu Qiubai saw Zhou Wen sit straight up, having awoken from his sweet slumber. Without even turning back, he grabbed his phone and rushed out of the classroom. This only disappointed Yu Qiubai as he muttered with a sigh, “Principal, I’ve tried my best. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen is a hopeless case.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen jogged the entire way and soon left the building before coming to a secluded corner in the school compound.</p>
<p>He wasn’t oblivious to the strange looks his teachers and schoolmates gave him, but he didn’t take it to heart.</p>
<p>Others believed that Zhou Wen had wallowed in self-misery because he had failed to handle the setback, but he knew very well that he had never taken the defeat to heart. The reason he was “abandoning himself to vice” was due to an incomprehensible reason that even he couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>After unlocking his phone, with great familiarity, Zhou Wen launched a game program called “Ant Nest”. Soon, the phone’s screen revealed the dark interior of an ant nest. The meandering paths had countless black ants crawling about.</p>
<p>After ensuring that no one was looking at him, Zhou Wen pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the screen.</p>
<p>A strange scene happened the next second. The drop of blood seeped into the screen as a blood-colored avatar appeared in the game screen of Ant Nest. Beside the blood-colored avatar was a stat window.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Age: 16 years</p>
<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 9</p>
<p>Speed: 5</p>
<p>Constitution: 8</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 4</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic Meditation</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skills: None</p>
<p>Companion Beast: None</p>
<p>Ever since the dimensional storms, all sorts of dimensional life forms had appeared. They were roughly categorized as Mortal, Legendary, Epic, and Mythical. Humans stood at the bottom of the totem pole as Mortals. By cultivating in Primordial Energy Arts, they could raise their constitutions and evolve to higher life forms.</p>
<p>However, simply cultivating in a Primordial Energy Art to hone one’s body and evolve was extremely slow. Hunting dimensional creatures and robbing them of their dimensional crystals for one’s own use allowed accelerated evolution.</p>
<p>Pan-dimensional creatures lurked in dangerous places. Other than the zones where humanity had explored, the other zones were almost a sure ticket to death. Not everyone was willing to risk their lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s federation had clear rules—underaged youths were forbidden entry into the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>The Ascetic Meditation, which Zhou Wen had cultivated, was also a Primordial Energy Art. It solely relied on arduously tempering one’s body to cultivate Primordial Energy without the reliance on external forces.</p>
<p>In the federation, there were plenty of sixteen-year-old geniuses who could produce Primordial Energy from cultivation, but few people on Earth could do it simply by cultivating Ascetic Meditation and tempering his body to produce Primordial Energy, especially without any external help. He was the only one capable of doing so in the history of the small town of Guide City 1 .</p>
<p>Shortly after, every teacher and student in Guide High School believed that Zhou Wen would achieve great things in the future. Then, one day a transfer student came to Guide High School and challenged him. To everyone’s surprise, the transfer student defeated him in one strike. Furthermore, it was done by a girl.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped cultivating arduously after that. He appeared to abandon himself to vice. People imagined that he was mentally weak and couldn’t suffer the setback, but Zhou Wen knew very well that his change had nothing to do with the failure. It was completely because of the mysterious phone in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked down at his phone as he kept controlling the blood-colored avatar on it to slay the black ants in an Ant Nest.</p>
<p>“Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant… Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant… Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant…”</p>
<p>Notifications quickly flashed past as he killed every ant.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>After killing countless Vigor Ants, he suddenly heard a crisp sound as a special notice appeared on the screen: Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw a crystalline body resembling a diamond that appeared after a Vigor Ant was killed. On it was the number five.</p>
<p>He was delighted as he hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Primordial Energy Crystal. The moment the Primordial Energy Crystal touched its fingers, it immediately transformed into a strange aura that drilled into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Zhou Wen felt strength surge into his body from his phone as though he had been struck by lightning. It caused the Primordial Energy within him to be rapidly replenished.</p>
<p>The Primordial Energy entry in the blood-colored avatar’s stats went from four to five.</p>
<p>After killing a dimensional creature, there was a chance that various kinds of crystals would drop. The most common crystals were Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Primordial Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>The usage of Strength Crystals enhanced the Strength of humans, while using Speed Crystals increased one’s speed. The other crystals had similar effects.</p>
<p>But in reality, crystals didn’t have numeric displays. Humans couldn’t see their own stats and only knew that their Strength increased after using a Strength Crystal without knowing the exact quantitative increase.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone in Zhou Wen’s hand not only allowed him to obtain dimensional crystals that others had to risk their lives in dimensional zones to obtain, but it also allowed him to see the numeric values of the dimensional creatures, himself, as well as the dimensional crystals.</p>
<h3 id='chapter2'>Chapter 2: Ant Nest</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Ever since he had obtained that phone, Zhou Wen had spent nearly every moment grinding on it with a game. In turn, he received all kinds of dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>In the past, his Strength was 7, Speed was 4, Constitution was 7, and Primordial Energy was 1. After receiving the dimensional crystals from grinding, he had raised all these values in slightly more than a month. If it were in the past, it might have taken him years to develop so quickly.</p>
<p>After using large numbers of dimensional crystals, Zhou Wen realized a set of rules. No matter which dimensional crystal it was, as long as its value was higher than his, using it would result in his stats directly rising to the same value as the said dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>But if the dimensional crystal’s value was lower or the same as his, it could only replenish some of his energy. Then, by cultivating the Primordial Energy Art, he could raise his own stats instead of a direct raise.</p>
<p>This also meant that the higher the dimensional crystal’s value was, the better. Its effects on Zhou Wen would also be amplified. However, having killed so many Vigor Ants in the Ant Nest, the highest Strength Crystal he had seen was a 9. The highest Constitution Crystal was only an 8. Speed Crystals were all low in value. Primordial Energy Crystals were extremely rare. The 5 he had received today were the highest valued he had seen to date.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had considered the possibility that it had something to do with the Vigor Ants’ natural makeup. They were outstanding when it came to their Strength and Constitution, but their Speed was lacking. This was also why the Strength Crystals that he received were relatively high in value, while Speed Crystals weren’t much to speak of.</p>
<p>However, even low-valued dimensional crystals could be used as energy supplements, allowing Zhou Wen to quickly cultivate Ascetic Meditation; thus, it wasn’t completely useless.</p>
<p>The only regret was that the crystals that dropped in the game were directly absorbed upon contact with the blood-colored avatar. They couldn’t be brought to the real world; otherwise, just the sale of the low-valued crystals he had no use for would be enough to make him quite a wealthy person.</p>
<p>There were many ants in the Ant Nest, and whenever they discovered Zhou Wen’s blood-colored avatar, the number that gathered only increased.</p>
<p>After killing over a hundred Vigor Ants, another dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, it was a Strength Crystal 3 and could only be used for energy replenishment.</p>
<p>The drop rate of dimensional crystals wasn’t high, and most of them were valued at 3 or lower. The higher-valued ones had extremely low drop rates, so Zhou Wen could only rely on massive amounts of grinding to raise the chances of him getting them.</p>
<p>This was also the reason he often slept in class and stopped cultivating—apart from classes, he spent the rest of his time grinding, even at night. He didn’t have the time or energy to cultivate or pay attention in class.</p>
<p>Even so, the rate at which he strengthened himself was incomparable to the past. If he had only cultivated Ascetic Meditation like before, the time it took to raise his Primordial Energy to 5 would have been several times or even dozens of times longer.</p>
<p>As the number of Vigor Ants increased, Zhou Wen was beginning to feel overwhelmed. Before long, the blood-colored avatar was inundated by Vigor Ants, and the screen went black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to restart the game by dripping a drop of blood onto the game’s screen. His blood was akin to a 1-Up in games—one drop of blood was a life.</p>
<p>With the game launched, he embarked on his grinding again, killing one Vigor Ant after another. However, Zhou Wen wasn’t too lucky this time. Not a single dimensional crystal dropped despite killing over a hundred Vigor Ants.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen was a sedate person and not quick-tempered, he continued to patiently grind in the Ant Nest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he saw a somewhat special Vigor Ant amidst the hordes.</p>
<p>This Vigor Ant was blood-red in color as though it was completely covered in blood. It stood out among the other black Vigor Ants, and its head was slightly bigger. Zhou Wen noticed it immediately.</p>
<p>Upon noticing the red Vigor Ant gearing for a charge, Zhou Wen cautiously probed it and found its Strength and Speed was far greater than other black Vigor Ants. However, it was still manageable for him.</p>
<p>After positioning the blood-colored avatar several times, it managed to hit the red Vigor Ant, but only dealt minor damage to it. He had failed to slay it.</p>
<p>However, there was still clear progress—the red Vigor Ant’s health bar was slowly dropping. Perhaps about a hundred strikes were needed to slay it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the red Vigor Ant was only slightly faster than the typical black Vigor Ant. The blood-colored avatar had enough time to position itself and dodge, so killing it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>However, the black Vigor Ants were increasing in number. The development worried Zhou Wen because, at this speed, he might be swarmed by the ant horde before he successfully killed the red Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>However, no idea came to mind for the time being. Zhou Wen could only do his best to control the blood-colored avatar’s speed to deal damage to the red Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>Just as the red Vigor Ant’s health bar almost depleted to zero, the surrounding Vigor Ants increased, giving the blood-colored avatar no space to circle around the former.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar failed to dodge in time and was bitten by a black Vigor Ant. Instantly, its health bar was almost halved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he was at the end of the rope. All he could do was to use the blood-colored avatar to deliver one final strike with all its might at the red Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the punch landed, the red Vigor Ant’s vital spot was struck. Its final bit of health was depleted and its red carapace instantly exploded. Two crystals burst out from its carcass.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury to see what type of dimensional crystals they were. His blood-colored avatar was in a critical state as the two crystals were picked up.</p>
<p>Moments after the blood-colored avatar picked up the two dimensional crystals, it was swarmed by the Vigor Ant horde, and before long, the screen went black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the two notifications that appeared on the screen. He heaved a deep sigh of relief for he had had similar experiences. As long as he could pick up a dimensional crystal before dying, the effects would be applied.</p>
<p>“Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.”</p>
<p>“Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Vigor Ant Crystal.”</p>
<p>Upon seeing the two notifications on the screen, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. He had seen a Primordial Energy Crystal drop plenty of times, but a dimensional crystal named after Vigor Ants was a first.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Zhou Wen reacted. Although he had never seen such dimensional crystals, he had heard of their existence. In textbooks and videos on the Internet, people had used similar crystals. However, they weren’t Vigor Ant Crystals, but crystals of other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Could it be that this is one of those legendary dimensional crystals? While Zhou Wen was feeling exhilarated, he felt a strange force from his phone spread through his body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter3'>Chapter 3: Vigor Divine Fist</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>A force surged through Zhou Wen’s body like a bolt of lightning. He was no stranger to such a feeling for it was the feeling he received when absorbing Primordial Energy Crystals. However, this absorption was far more intense than anything he had previously felt. It was many times more intense than his past absorption of the five-valued Primordial Energy Crystal.</p>
<p>What’s the value of this Primordial Energy Crystal? Why is it so intense? As Zhou Wen reeled in delight, he felt another force surge into his body.</p>
<p>Unlike the Primordial Energy Crystal, this force surged through his body like an electric snake, opening up his originally sealed meridians, opening up a strange new path.</p>
<p>It’s true… The Vigor Ant Crystal is a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal as spoken in legends… However, I wonder what this Vigor Ant’s Primordial Energy Skill is… Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>As the electric snake-like force flowed through his body, Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy was being stirred as it began circulating in the newly opened pathways.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that with the circulation of the Primordial Energy, his hands turned blood-red with a metallic sheen. Furthermore, he had a strange swollen feeling. Although his palms didn’t increase in size, it made him feel that his hands contained an immense strength, one that was eager to blast out his palms.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had the urge to deal a punch, but he ultimately held back. He was on campus, and it wasn’t in his best interest to cause a commotion. Furthermore, any damage to public property required him to pay compensation.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty minutes later, the swelling feeling gradually subsided. His hands recovered to normal as the Primordial Energy in him stopped circulating. However, Zhou Wen knew that this Primordial Energy blast skill had been imprinted deep in his body and soul. It had seemingly become innate to his body, something he could not forget no matter how he tried.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to look at his phone. The game interface had already gone black. He immediately restarted the game and dripped a drop of blood in. When his in-game avatar appeared, he immediately checked his character stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Age: 16 years</p>
<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 9</p>
<p>Speed: 5</p>
<p>Constitution: 8</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 9</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic Meditation</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 7)</p>
<p>Companion Beast: None</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. His Primordial Energy had risen all the way to 9. It meant that the Primordial Energy Crystal he had absorbed was valued at 9. And the Rank 7 indicated behind Vigor Divine Fist was similar to seven-valued stat crystals. Without any cultivation, Zhou Wen’s Vigor Divine Fist had reached a rather high rank.</p>
<p>As Primordial Energy Skills were relatively rare, they were rather expensive. However, after receiving this Skill, he would make use of it. He could greatly enhance his various abilities, unleashing combat strength that far exceeded his normal standards. It gave him the important means to protect himself and kill enemies. No one would dislike having too many Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had lacked the finances to purchase Primordial Energy Skill Crystals and with him fully focused on cultivating Ascetic Meditation, he lacked the time and energy to practice the Skills. This Vigor Divine Fist was his first Primordial Energy Skill, and from its name and effects, it was likely a skill that enhanced the strength of both his fists.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Ant Nest in the game is identical to the dimensional zones in the real world. Does this mean that the game will also drop Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen felt slightly pumped.</p>
<p>As he began grinding again in the game, his avatar was similarly able to use Vigor Divine Fist. Eagerly, Zhou Wen made his avatar use Vigor Divine Fist to see its might.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar struck a Vigor Ant, bashing its head into its body. Then, its body exploded due to the immense pressure. Its flesh, blood, and carapace splattered everywhere, reducing it to a blob.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted upon seeing this. The blood-colored avatar was equivalent to a clone. If it could produce such might, it also meant that he could do the same in reality.</p>
<p>In the past, he had needed several strikes to kill a Vigor Ant, and that had needed him to strike a vital spot. Vigor Divine Fist could ignore the Vigor Ant’s carapace’s defense and directly blast them apart. Its strength was frighteningly potent.</p>
<p>However, although Vigor Divine Fist was powerful, this punch expended 4 Primordial Energy. With Zhou Wen’s maximum Primordial Energy at 9, he could only deliver two strikes before he was drained.</p>
<p>Although Primordial Energy could recover on its own, it happened rather slowly. Zhou Wen took an hour to recover one point, so it was sorely insufficient to keep up with his expenditure.</p>
<p>Of course, he could also use Primordial Energy Crystals to quickly recover Primordial Energy. To most people, this was an extremely extravagant act.</p>
<p>Although he had received a Primordial Energy Skill, he could only use it as a trump card for now. Zhou Wen continued patiently grinding as before, hoping that a more magical drop would appear.</p>
<p>Grinding was undoubtedly dull and boring. However, for a person who could hone his body and cultivate Primordial Energy through Ascetic Meditation before the age of sixteen, this boredom was nothing.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was holding his phone and engrossed with grinding, he suddenly sensed someone approaching him. Looking up, he saw a tall girl in a high-school uniform walk over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned to look around her. Students typically didn’t come here, and it was the same at present. He was apparently the only person around for dozens of meters, and it was for this reason that he chose this spot to game.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me Fang Ruoxi is looking for me? Zhou Wen looked at the girl walking straight towards him, and in response, he could only put away his phone for he didn’t wish for anyone to see what was on it. Otherwise, it could invite huge trouble for him.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi was tall, standing at a height of 1.75 meters. At this age, she wasn’t short among men and would stand out among women.</p>
<p>Although she was tall, her body proportions were excellent. Together with her slender body and constant training, she didn’t seem too big in size. Her long, slender legs and exaggerated curves gave quite a strong visual impact. She had a primal charm of a feral nature.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi’s name was quite a demure name for a girl, but it didn’t match her character. She was a rather proud girl. Before An Jing transferred over, Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen were considered the two most illustrious geniuses in Guide High School.</p>
<p>However, the two of them weren’t in the same class. They both had asocial characters, and as Zhou Wen spent most of his time focusing on cultivating Ascetic Meditation and honing his body, the two never had much interaction other than the polite greeting from time to time.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi was clearly here for Zhou Wen. It left him perplexed, unsure why she was looking for him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I wish to invite you to join my team for the combat test at the end of the graduation exams.” Fang Ruoxi came before Zhou Wen and said those startling words to him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter4'>Chapter 4: Fang Ruoxi’s Invitation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The cultivation of Primordial Energy Art already played an important role in the Earth Federation’s physical education system. Apart from the ordinary subjects tested at the college entrance examinations, there was a special combat test.</p>
<p>As combat tests were dangerous, not every candidate needed to participate, and the results weren’t included in the overall score of the entrance examinations. It was completely voluntary to participate, but to apply for some special schools, the results of a combat test was necessary for standardization purposes.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, more and more famous schools used the results of the combat test as one of the standards for student recruitment.</p>
<p>Of course, to get a job involving dimensional zones, the results on the combat test was a very good prerequisite.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could obtain dimensional crystals from the phone without him risking his life to enter dimensional zones, he still planned on taking the combat test and enter a school focused on cultivation. This would aid him in getting a job related to the dimensional zones in the future.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen didn’t involve himself in any dimensional zone work, he wouldn’t have the sources or channels to obtain dimensional crystals. This would make it difficult for him to explain his rapid growth or any Companion Beasts he might receive in the future.</p>
<p>By hiding in plain sight he would not garner the notice of others, just as a diamond would be lost in a sea of crystals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to risk his life at the dimensional zones, but he needed to have a job involving such matters. At the very least, he needed a channel to obtain dimensional items. This way, he wouldn’t be suspected when he used large numbers of dimensional crystals in the future.</p>
<p>The combat test wasn’t a solo affair. Instead, it was carried out in a team of four. Apart from one’s individual combat prowess, teamwork, leadership, and other traits influenced the final results.</p>
<p>If one were to be the final man standing in the combat test, with the other teammates dropping out ahead of time or an accident happening, one’s score would be greatly affected, even if the individual did very well to receive high individual scores.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had quite a good reputation in Guide High School in the past. He was an ideal teammate, but in the past month or so, his image and reputation had drastically declined. There were also significant doubts about his abilities.</p>
<p>It was still understandable if an ordinary student were to team up with him, but for Fang Ruoxi who had a chance of coming first in the Guide City combat test, there wasn’t a good reason for her to recruit him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been famous because of his cultivation of Ascetic Meditation. But when it came to actual strength, there were a few sixteen-year-olds in Guide High School who had cultivated Primordial Energy. However, they were not like Zhou Wen who simply relied on honing his body to cultivate Primordial Energy. They had more or less absorbed Primordial Energy Crystals to supplement their cultivation.</p>
<p>“Why are you recruiting me?” Zhou Wen asked Fang Ruoxi with piqued interest.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen locked gazes. Her eyes were clear and untainted like a mountain spring.</p>
<p>“I want to do my best to get a high score on the combat test, so I need a strong teammate. And you have that strength,” Fang Ruoxi said calmly.</p>
<p>“You are referring to me from a month ago, right?”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi’s glimmering eyes stared at Zhou Wen intently as she said firmly, “From what I see, Zhou Wen is Zhou Wen. He has never changed. You are still the only person in Guide High School that I view as my match.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He was rather surprised that Fang Ruoxi thought so highly of him. He couldn’t help but feel some indescribable, odd feelings.</p>
<p>“What’s An Jing if you say something like that?” Zhou Wen said in a self-deprecating manner. Although he wasn’t concerned about his defeat under An Jing’s hands, he had to admit that she was much stronger than he was.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi sighed. “I said the only person in Guide High School. An Jing was never one of us. Also, she will not be participating in the college entrance exams here.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know? She has already transferred out.” Fang Ruoxi paused and continued, “Although I don’t know An Jing’s origins, I’m certain that she has exceeded the Mortal stage. To reach such a stage at her age, she must have quite a remarkable background. And with that strength of hers, it was completely unnecessary to challenge you. Furthermore, her arrival and departure happened so suddenly. It gives the feeling that she just came here to beat you up. I even imagined that you were acquainted with her and had crossed her somehow.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never thought too much about it previously. Now, on careful thought, it did seem to be the case. He could, however, be sure that he had never met An Jing before, much less have crossed her.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? I’ve never met her before. How could I have crossed her?” Zhou Wen tried carefully recalling, but couldn’t figure out how he could have had bad blood with her.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I was just overthinking it.” Fang Ruoxi didn’t continue on the topic as she looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “So, what’s your answer?”</p>
<p>“Since you are willing to team up with me, I naturally don’t mind cozying up to someone powerful,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>
<p>“Then it’s a deal. I’ve already found the other two teammates. Starting today, the four of us will train together during cultivation classes in the afternoon. We need to ensure that we have the necessary teamwork and coordination during the combat test.” Fang Ruoxi looked at her wristwatch and turned to say to Zhou Wen, “Come on. Cultivation classes are about to begin.”</p>
<p>When Li Zhi and Tian Xiangdong watched Fang Ruoxi return with Zhou Wen, they were quite surprised. They knew that she had gone to find their fourth teammate, but weren’t aware of who she had in mind.</p>
<p>Now, upon realizing that it was Zhou Wen, they felt puzzled. They all knew of Zhou Wen’s antics over the past month.</p>
<p>Cultivation was in an ever-regressive state, especially combat. Even frequent practice made it difficult to seize fleeting opportunities in battle. The lack of practice for a few days greatly slowed down one’s reflexes. Considering how Zhou Wen hadn’t practiced for over a month with him completely engrossed in gaming, to the point of looking pale and sickly, it was almost a certainty that his combat abilities had drastically fallen.</p>
<p>It was just like a professional boxer. They needed enough time to recover and train after a period of zero practice to compete in matches again. No one could become stronger doing nothing. They only became weaker.</p>
<p>They weren’t that far off from the college entrance exams, and even if Zhou Wen made a comeback like a prodigal son, it would be very difficult for him to recover his original combat prowess.</p>
<p>“Ruoxi, don’t tell me the fourth teammate is Zhou Wen? Is this a joke!?” Tian Xiangdong rubbed his nose and said in an exaggerated manner.</p>
<p>“I’m not joking. Zhou Wen will be our fourth teammate,” Fang Ruoxi said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong looked at Fang Ruoxi and then at Zhou Wen. He habitually rubbed his nose and said, “Ruoxi, all of us know how talented and capable Zhou Wen is, but he hasn’t been training for more than a month. Even if he were to restart his training now, it will be difficult for him to recover his former standards. Our goal is to be first in Guide City’s combat test. I don’t think Zhou Wen is the best candidate? Why don’t we do this? I have some ties with Zheng Yi. If you feel uncomfortable asking him, I’ll do the invitation. How about that?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter5'>Chapter 5: Strength Test</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Tian Xiangdong’s words were clearly directed at Zhou Wen, but the latter wasn’t angered.</p>
<p>The combat test at the college entrance exam was key to the latter half of an average person’s life. Anyone would hope to do their best and not have others affect their own results.</p>
<p>Whether one could attend a reputable school, find a decent job after graduation, or even have the chance of entering high society, was highly tied to the test.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strength of a teammate affected one’s safety. No one wished to use their lives as a joke.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen had aimed for a reputable school before he obtained the mysterious phone. This gave him more opportunities to become stronger and not let his talent go to waste. Therefore, Zhou Wen could fully comprehend Tian Xiangdong’s rationale for saying such things.</p>
<p>After Tian Xiangdong said his piece, he stopped looking at Fang Ruoxi and stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Zheng Yi might be outstanding as well, but I think Zhou Wen is the best candidate.”</p>
<p>By the side, Li Zhi thought and said, “We know you have an eye for talent, Ruoxi. Zhou Wen is indeed outstanding, but the combat test results are very important to all of us. We have to treat it with utmost seriousness. Let’s do this. If Zhou Wen doesn’t mind, we can do a simple test. Once the results of the test are out, it will be obvious if Zhou Wen suits our team.”</p>
<p>“Li Zhi’s right. I agree,” Tian Xiangdong said immediately.</p>
<p>“What kind of test?” Fang Ruoxi asked.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that be simple? I’m the weakest among the three of us. Let Zhou Wen fight me in combat. As long as he defeats me, he will naturally be qualified to join our team. You wouldn’t call that bullying, right?” Tian Xiangdong hurriedly said.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi didn’t say a word and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he needed to voice his opinion at such times; otherwise, it would be difficult for him to join the team. Although he wasn’t too interested in joining this team, he still wished to get good results for the combat test. Fang Ruoxi’s team was likely considered the strongest team at Guide High School, so there was definitely no harm in joining them.</p>
<p>“I’m fine with that. However, actual combat has risks. It would be terrible if anyone gets injured,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong laughed in response. “Zhou Wen, I know you’ve been cultivating Ascetic Meditation. Your Constitution and Strength must be extraordinary, but your Speed must be lacking. I won’t take advantage of your weaknesses. Why don’t we determine the winner through a Strength competition?”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi couldn’t help but frown when she heard Tian Xiangdong.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong cultivated Lightning Art and it was also a Primordial Energy Art that primarily unleashed massive bursts of strength. Tian Xiangdong had also coupled Lightning Art with a Primordial Energy Skill, Lighting Fist. Tian Xiangdong’s Lightning Fist had only reached Rank 1, however, among typical high school students, the chances of them coming into contact with a Primordial Energy Skill was rather low. To grasp one Primordial Energy Skill, especially one that matched their Primordial Energy Art, was very rare.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi didn’t know Zhou Wen’s family background, but from the way he cultivated a Primordial Energy Art like Ascetic Meditation, without ever purchasing any supplementary Primordial Energy Crystals, it was highly likely that his family wasn’t well-to-do. If he couldn’t even afford Primordial Energy Crystals, how could he have the money to buy the expensive Primordial Energy Skill Crystals?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in his battle with An Jing, he hadn’t used any Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi’s lips quivered, but she didn’t say a word. She thought inwardly, “Let’s see how Zhou Wen will handle this.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tian Xiangdong and asked, “How do we compete in Strength?”</p>
<p>“Although the school has a Strength-measuring device, those lifeless numbers don’t mean much. Let’s exchange blows. Whoever retreats loses. How about that?” Tian Xiangdong said with squinted eyes.</p>
<p>“I think it’s better we use the school’s Strength-measure device,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you afraid of me injuring you?” Tian Xiangdong said, curling his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled without a word. He was more afraid of killing Tian Xiangdong with one punch.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong’s Primordial Energy Skill, Lightning Fist, wasn’t a secret at school. Just relying on strength alone probably couldn’t beat him. Therefore, if Zhou Wen used Vigor Divine Fist, he was afraid that a single punch would obliterate Tian Xiangdong’s arm as well as his body.</p>
<p>“Alright. Since you’re afraid, let’s use the Strength-measuring device,” Tian Xiangdong said, feeling some regret.</p>
<p>For the past three years in high school, all the teachers and students had claimed that Zhou Wen was the number one genius of Guide High School. Tian Xiangdong naturally wasn’t very accepting of this accolade and had long wished to prove himself by defeating Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This was a tiny wish many top students at the school had. After Zhou Wen was defeated by An Jing’s single blow, this desire subsided significantly.</p>
<p>However, since there was a chance to defeat him, Tian Xiangdong still held some anticipation and excitement. After all, Zhou Wen was once honored as Guide High School’s number one genius.</p>
<p>The only thing that left Tian Xiangdong regretful was that he couldn’t personally defeat Zhou Wen as An Jing did. All he could do was defeat him with numbers on a Strength-measuring device.</p>
<p>Now that it was lunchtime, the device room didn’t have any students. As always, Yu Qiubai was inspecting the various devices personally, checking to see if there were any problematic ones that could receive timely repairs.</p>
<p>Just as Yu Qiubai sat inside a spacecraft-like Primordial Energy-measurement device, he heard someone push open the door. Following that there were footsteps.</p>
<p>It’s lunchtime. Who would come here? Yu Qiubai looked out the observation hole from inside the device and discovered that it was Fang Ruoxi, Tian Xiangdong, Li Zhi, and Zhou Wen. He couldn’t help but be somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>These four students could basically be considered the top elites of Guide High School’s graduating class. Apart from Zhou Wen’s wallowing in self-misery, the other three were highly anticipated to do well.</p>
<p>For the four to come to the device room, including Zhou Wen, left Yu Qiubai curious. He had no idea what they were doing here.</p>
<p>Four… Could these four be forming a team to participate in the combat test… But with Zhou Wen’s current state… How could Fang Ruoxi and the rest be willing to form a team with him? Yu Qiubai’s heart stirred as he remained inside the Primordial Energy-measuring device. He was curious as to what they were up to.</p>
<p>“Who’s going first? You or me?” Tian Xiangdong walked to the Strength-measuring device and turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Anything works,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Anyway, everyone gets three tries. The highest one shall count. Since it doesn’t matter who goes first, I’ll do the honors first,” Tian Xiangdong said as he walked in front of the device.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong took a deep breath as he circulated his Lightning Art and gathered his strength before smashing his fist into the pressure board on the Strength-measuring device.</p>
<p>The pressure board was made up of a metal alloy with hydraulic machinery behind. Based on the different amount of strength delivered, the board would jerk back and produce a figure onscreen.</p>
<p>When Tian Xiangdong threw the punch, a series of numbers lit up on the display one after another. It only stopped when it reached 7.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong hadn’t used Lightning Fist and had only relied on pure Strength. With regard to that, he was rather satisfied with the value of 7.</p>
<p>For the average high-school student, a Strength value of 7 was undoubtedly head and shoulders above their peers.</p>
<h3 id='chapter6'>Chapter 6: Inch Punch</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Tian Xiangdong having 7 for his Strength surprised Zhou Wen slightly.</p>
<p>The Strength-measuring device’s value was slightly different from the Strength stat in the game on the phone. However, the difference wasn’t that much. They could basically be considered as sharing the same unit.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen received the mysterious phone, his Strength was only a 7 as well.</p>
<p>“It’s your turn,” Tian Xiangdong took a step to the side and said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of the Strength-measuring device as the trio’s eyes landed on him. All of them wanted to know how much strength this former number one genius of Guide High School had left.</p>
<p>Inside the Primordial Energy module, Yu Qiubai shared the same sentiments. After spending more than a month as a wastrel, how much more strength did Zhou Wen have?</p>
<p>Although Strength wasn’t something that declined as quickly as one’s reaction in combat, having it was one thing, and delivering it was another.</p>
<p>Skills to deliver Strength required plenty of practice before one could perfectly release one’s Strength. Over time, one would get rusty; therefore, even if one still had Strength, they could hardly release it completely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of the pressure board, taking on a pose to deliver an Inch Punch. It wasn’t a Primordial Energy Skill, but an ordinary combat skill. It was part of the school’s normal teachings.</p>
<p>However, Inch Punch was easy to pick up but difficult to master. It was used to deliver the greatest amount of strength at the shortest distance and was one that needed plenty of practice to achieve a certain level of mastery. Furthermore, it was delivered at short distances, so Inch Punch didn’t have any beautiful or cool poses. The typical student was more willing to practice something that showed its effects quickly and punching techniques that appeared domineering.</p>
<p>Of course, even more students chose to train in weapons. After all, the damage from weapons in actual combat was far greater than one’s limbs.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen nearly plaster his fist to the pressure board, Fang Ruoxi and company realized that he was using Inch Punch.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong curled his lips and said, “The explosive strength delivered by Inch Punch is very strong indeed, but it’s not something easily mastered without years of strenuous training. Let’s hope Zhou Wen doesn’t end up overshooting his mark.”</p>
<p>Although Tian Xiangdong’s words weren’t pleasant, Yu Qiubai agreed. Inch Punch wasn’t easily mastered. Zhou Wen didn’t seem to practice much and in the recent month, he had engrossed himself in gaming. Therefore, to use Inch Punch for a Strength test might end up giving him worse results.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As the quartet was still in thought, they saw Zhou Wen’s fist tremble at an extremely fast speed. It was so fast that they might have imagined themselves seeing things if not for the explosive bang from the pressure board. It was as though Zhou Wen’s fist had never moved.</p>
<p>Their eight eyes quickly looked towards the screen. They wished to know the results of Zhou Wen’s punch.</p>
<p>The gap’s too tiny! The same thought came to the minds of Tian Xiangdong, Fang Ruoxi, and Li Zhi simultaneously.</p>
<p>The distance he threw his punch from was too tiny. Although Inch Punch is about delivering the most amount of Strength with the shortest distance, it’s very difficult to deliver any Strength when the gap is too tiny, just like a person can jump higher when squatting down or retracting an arm to deliver a more powerful punch. Inch Punch goes the whole way. Only true Inch Punch experts can deliver that much Strength at such short distances… Yu Qiubai had a lot more going on in his mind.</p>
<p>When all of them saw the number on the screen, their eyes widened immediately.</p>
<p>They saw one number after another light up, and soon 10 was lit up. Zhou Wen’s Inch Punch had delivered 10 points of Strength.</p>
<p>10! It’s a 10! How is this possible? Yu Qiubai was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai had been teaching for years.The thought of a high-school student delivering a punch with a Strength of 10, without using any Primordial Energy Skills, was terrifying.</p>
<p>Even if the typical student had Strength Crystals to use, it was very difficult for them to reach such levels during high school. This was because typical Strength Crystals were limited when it came to enhancing one’s Strength. Beyond 7, using a typical Strength Crystal was practically useless.</p>
<p>One couldn’t have their Strength improve unless one had extremely high-quality Strength Crystals; otherwise, they could only cultivate a Primordial Energy Art to constantly hone their bodies to slowly grow their Strength.</p>
<p>But that was just too difficult. Before evolving to the Legendary stage, it was very difficult for the typical human to have Strength reaching a value of 10. Most humans were at 7–8 at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was clearly still in the Mortal stage; yet, he could deliver Strength valued at 10 with just his muscles alone. This was considered extremely rare even in the entire League. It was probably not an exaggeration to call it one in a million.</p>
<p>Could it be that Zhou Wen didn’t wallow in his self-misery? The reason he’s constantly sleeping in class is because of the fatigue from training himself even more excessively? The more Yu Qiubai thought about it, the more he was convinced of his theory. The look he gave Zhou Wen was mixed with approbation and cherishing, as well as relief. It has to be the case. The former principal knows better indeed. I had mistaken him. To have 10 Strength at the Mortal stage is not something anyone in Guide City can match. Even among all the high school students on Earth, he will still be top-class… What a good child… It must have been hard on him…</p>
<p>The more Yu Qiubai thought about it, the more he fondness he felt for Zhou Wen. He felt that not only was Zhou Wen talented, but the latter also had a good temperament. Ever since he was defeated by An Jing, many people had been wagging their tongues at him. Under such immense pressure, he hadn’t tried to defend himself but had actually managed to cultivate such an impressive step in a short period of time. Such a state of mind and talent was very rare among high school students.</p>
<p>“No way? Delivering 10 without using any Primordial Energy Skills? Don’t tell me this fellow is hiding at home daily and honing his Strength?” Tian Xiangdong couldn’t help but gulp. To deliver 10 Strength at the Mortal stage was just too shocking. It was rare for a tiny city like Guide City to produce such a person.</p>
<p>Li Zhi and Fang Ruoxi looked at Zhou Wen with odd looks. Although Fang Ruoxi never believed Zhou Wen to be someone who would wallow in self-misery and that he had trained arduously in private, she had never expected him to attain such progress.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the numbers from the Strength-measuring device are a little different from the game. In-game, my Strength is 9, but in the real world, it’s 10. Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“To be able to deliver 10 Strength, you do live up to your reputation as the number one genius of Guide High School. However, if you believe that you have defeated me, you’re wrong,” Tian Xiangdong said as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen’s result, Tian Xiangdong was already willing to let the former join their team.</p>
<p>Although Tian Xiangdong could deliver more than 10 Strength with Lightning Fist, it was something that expended Primordial Energy. At this present level, he could only deliver one punch in a short period of time, preventing him from using it for long.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he had delivered 10 Strength. He could engage in combat for long periods of time, a huge boon to the team. It was even more useful than Tian Xiangdong’s Lightning Fist.</p>
<p>Another reason was Zhou Wen’s Inch Punch. To be able to use that, it was obvious that Zhou Wen hadn’t given up on himself. He must have been secretly cultivating and hadn’t suffered from being rusty with his skills.</p>
<p>However, Tian Xiangdong wasn’t willing to admit defeat. He still planned on defeating Zhou Wen before magnanimously voicing out his acceptance of Zhou Wen into the team.</p>
<h3 id='chapter7'>Chapter 7: Destroying the Machine With One Punch</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Xiangdong…” Li Zhi was just about to say something when Tian Xiangdong waved his hand to cut him off.</p>
<p>The benefits were obvious if a person with Strength 10 could join their team. Li Zhi believed that since Zhou Wen had shown enough of his prowess, there was no need to continue. Making things ugly was not beneficial to any party.</p>
<p>If Tian Xiangdong were to use Lightning Fist to defeat Zhou Wen; thus, causing him to leave. It would be a loss for them.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Tian Xiangdong walk to the pressure board, Li Zhi had wanted to say this but was stopped by Fang Ruoxi.</p>
<p>“Is this really fine?” Li Zhi looked at Fang Ruoxi and said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. That fellow has already accepted Zhou Wen. He just doesn’t want to lose,” Fang Ruoxi said softly.</p>
<p>Li Zhi was slightly taken aback before he was enlightened. He cursed in amusement before falling silent, “That fellow just can’t bear to play second fiddle.”</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong began the second round of Strength tests.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong’s expression was heavy as he stood in front of the pressure board. He slowly lifted his fist as veins protruded from it. Lightning bolts seemed to mesh together, making it look ferocious and terrifying.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The fist slammed heavily into the pressure board. The special metal alloy pressure board jerked back obviously as the numbers on the screen rapidly lit up, eventually stopping at 11.</p>
<p>“How’s that?” As he reeled from expending all his Primordial Energy, Tian Xiangdong secretly wiped sweat from his brow.</p>
<p>His Strength was only a 7. And with a Rank 1 Lightning Fist, it could raise his Strength by about half. It wasn’t extremely stable, allowing him to dish out 10 or 11 randomly. He had done pretty well today, allowing him to defeat Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“That’s impressive.” Zhou Wen was indeed a genius when it came to cultivation. However, he wasn’t a sensitive person. He didn’t notice Tian Xiangdong’s emotional changes and was caught up with the notion that he couldn’t join the team unless he defeated Tian Xiangdong. Therefore, he walked towards the Strength-measuring device again.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately throw out his punch. Instead, he began studying the Strength-measuring device.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? Just tell us if you can’t do it. It’s not embarrassing losing to me.” Realizing that Zhou Wen wasn’t delivering the punch, Tian Xiangdong was imagining that Zhou Wen lacked the confidence and was hesitant about delivering the punch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Strength-measuring device and asked worriedly, “The school won’t ask me to pay for it if I break it, right?”</p>
<p>The moment Tian Xiangdong heard Zhou Wen, he burst out in exasperated laughter. “Bro, nice bragging. This is a Strength-measuring device. It’s specially made for Strength-measuring. Although it’s only a low-end model meant for high schoolers with an upper limit of 20, few high schoolers can hit the limit, much less destroy it. Let’s do this. If you really destroy it, I’ll pay for the damages.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense.” Zhou Wen nodded. The device did seem rather solid, so it was unlikely it be damaged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate further as he raised his fist. The skin on his fist gradually turned red with a metallic sheen. It looked like it was wrapped in a red metallic membrane.</p>
<p>“Primordial Energy Skill… So Zhou Wen has already learned a Primordial Energy Skill…” Tian Xiangdong was instantly somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, with Zhou Wen’s Strength, the knowledge of a Primordial Energy Skill—no matter how weak it was—could dish out Strength that was far greater than Tian Xiangdong’s. Therefore, the latter knew that his loss was a certainty.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi and Li Zhi were somewhat surprised that Zhou Wen knew a Primordial Energy Skill. It enabled them to earn higher points at the combat test.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slammed his fist heavily into the pressure board and as though it was hit by a sledgehammer, it jerked back. The numbers on the screen kept lighting up, instantly surpassing 11.</p>
<p>I wonder what his final score will be through the use of a Primordial Energy Skill, Fang Ruoxi thought, but she saw the numbers lighting up at a blisteringly fast rate. In a blink of an eye, all of the numbers were lit up as her expression changed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Before the spectators could have any thoughts, the Strength-measuring device produced a strange sound. At some spot, the back of the device cracked as pale yellow liquid spewed out like a fountain.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong and company widened their mouths into an O shape as they stared blankly at Zhou Wen and the liquid-spewing Strength-measuring device. There was silence.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai’s eyes widened as well, eager to rush forward to personally determine if the Strength-measuring device was really broken.</p>
<p>He naturally wasn’t wanting payment from Zhou Wen, but that he was filled with disbelief that a high schooler’s Primordial Energy Skill could be this strong.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong trembled. At the thought of the punch’s might, he couldn’t bring himself to imagine what would have happened if he had battled Zhou Wen in a Strength test.</p>
<p>The upper limit of the Strength-measuring device was 20, but it didn’t mean that it could only withstand Strength 20. In fact, to burst the hydraulic mechanism needed Strength that far exceeded 20.</p>
<p>Even with Strength 10, Zhou Wen probably needed a Primordial Energy Skill at Rank 8 or 9 to deliver such damage.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t learned of Zhou Wen’s background from the former principal, he would even have suspected that Zhou Wen had used high-level Primordial Energy Skill Crystals; otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to possess such Strength.</p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen’s background, it seemed impossible for him to possess such high-level Primordial Energy Skill Crystals.</p>
<p>If he had truly mastered a Primordial Energy Skill to such a level by himself, that’s way too terrifying! Yu Qiubai couldn’t help but recall the former principal’s evaluation of Zhou Wen: “There are two geniuses in the world. One type of genius is called Zhou Wen, the other type are the other geniuses.”</p>
<p>“You said that you’d be paying if it’s damaged. You’re a man of his word, right?” Zhou Wen was taken aback as he looked at Tian Xiangdong.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Vigor Divine Fist to really be vigorous enough to destroy the Strength-measuring device.</p>
<p>He was poor and really didn’t have the money to compensate the school if it really pressed him for damages.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll pay for it. Bro, any problem that can be solved with money isn’t a problem. We are old classmates and a team. Leave this to me,” Tian Xiangdong said with a beaming smile as he came round.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong came from a rich family and could easily afford it. However, a second teammate like Zhou Wen was probably impossible to find in a small city like Guide City.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen joining the team, Tian Xiangdong believed that perhaps they weren’t only able to obtain first at the combat test in Guide City, but that they could even raise their targets.</p>
<p>Li Zhi and Fang Ruoxi were in a good mood as well. Having a powerful teammate like Zhou Wen join the team brought them one step closer to their goals.</p>
<p>This fellow is more interesting than I imagined. Fang Ruoxi narrowed her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen officially joining the team, the four submitted an application form for the combat test. Many of the teachers and heads in the school were rather surprised to see Zhou Wen’s name on the list.</p>
<p>The teachers of Fang Ruoxi, Li Zhi, and Tian Xiangdong had even spoken to them privately, openly and covertly trying to get them to select another teammate. They didn’t want Zhou Wen to be a burden on them. However, the trio refused, adamant about having Zhou Wen in their team. It left their teachers vexed.</p>
<p>Only Yu Qiubai drank his tea calmly. He knew very well that Zhou Wen was the strongest among the four.</p>
<p>Just wait and see. After the test, we will know who’s the burden. Yu Qiubai drank his tea as he thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was his student, so he was naturally displeased that the other teachers spoke ill of him behind Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<h3 id='chapter8'>Chapter 8: Zhou Lingfeng</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. The thoughts of others had nothing to do with him. All he wanted was to score well at the combat test during the college entrance exams. From that, he could enter a reputable school before focusing on gaming. After cruising through college and graduating, he could then get a job related to the dimensional zones.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that Zhou Wen took notice of. Fang Ruoxi’s mention of his defeat under An Jing’s hands had made him realize something was amiss. It was something he hadn’t thought too deeply about previously.</p>
<p>An Jing was about his age and was perhaps a little younger; yet, she was very likely already a Legendary stage expert. Although they were just separated by one stage, it was a night and day difference between the Mortal and Legendary stages. It was almost impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to defeat a Legendary stage expert.</p>
<p>The clearest indicator of a Legendary stage expert was the opportunity to obtain a Companion Beast. And at the Mortal stage, it was very difficult to obtain Companion Beasts. Even if one did get a Companion Egg, they lacked the Primordial Energy to carry out the incubation.</p>
<p>There were also many opaque differences. For example, after a human advanced to the Legendary stage, they would awaken their Legendary Life Providence, greatly augmenting their constitutions. It also widened the gap between Mortal stage and Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Unless there was any reason that prompted action, the typical Legendary stage expert found it beneath them to attack people at the Mortal stage. For An Jing to challenge him, a student at the Mortal stage, and then transfer out of the school shortly after the challenge, it appeared as though she had specially come to beat him up.</p>
<p>“I’ve never left Guide City all my life. How could I have offended someone like her? Could it be Dad…” As Zhou Wen thought about it, he came up with one possibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mother had passed away during childbirth, causing him to be brought up in a single-parent family. As for his dad, he was an unreliable man.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s father was named Zhou Lingfeng. Like the word ‘feng’ symbolizing ‘wind’ in his name, he was like a gust of wind. From the age of five, Zhou Wen learned to be independent. He had to do simple cooking, laundry, and the management of household matters, as well as do groceries.</p>
<p>And in the words of his unreliable dad, this was to nurture his survivability as a man. It would also be the foundation on which he would use to get a wife.</p>
<p>Although his dad was very lazy, there was something that left Zhou Lingfeng slightly relieved. Zhou Lingfeng had never missed out on paying his living expenses.</p>
<p>As a polyglot, Zhou Lingfeng did translation work. When Zhou Wen was young, his father often translated documents from home. However, with the improvement in technology, translation software became much better and Zhou Lingfeng’s work reduced as a result.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen grew a little older, he became more independent, so Zhou Lingfeng took on interpretation work. He often went out of town for a week or even as long as a few months.</p>
<p>The latest instance was more ridiculous. Zhou Wen hadn’t seen his father in half a year. If it wasn’t for his monthly living expenses being transferred into his account, he would have been worried his father had died.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Lingfeng often went to relatively remote places. The reception conditions there were often terrible, so it was common for him to be uncontactable. Zhou Wen was used to it.</p>
<p>Even if he wasn’t used to it, it wasn’t as though he could do anything about it other than waiting for Zhou Lingfeng’s return.</p>
<p>Their home was made up of two men. Zhou Wen had no chance to offend a figure like An Jing, so he was highly suspicious that his dad had offended her. Failing to find him, all she could do was to vent her anger on his son.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had zero confidence in his dad. He was the kind of person that indulged in pleasures. He was also someone who often spent time at bars. He had often hit on chicks in the past, only to be beaten up by the woman’s male partner.</p>
<p>Luckily Zhou Wen was able to fend for himself. If not, he wondered if Zhou Lingfeng would even have had the ability to raise him.</p>
<p>As he thought about it, his phone suddenly rang. With his mind wandering, Zhou Wen jumped. After taking out his ordinary phone, he realized it was from his father, Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil. Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the call. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhou Lingfeng’s voice: “Son, I’m getting married. Will you be coming to my wedding?”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t drinking any water; otherwise, he would have spewed it all out.</p>
<p>“You’re getting married? To whom?” Zhou Wen wasn’t against Zhou Lingfeng getting married. After all, he had been single for so many years, so it was very normal for him to find a partner. Besides, he might become more reliable after his marriage, so it could be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>“I’ll send Sweety’s photo to you,” Zhou Lingfeng said. Before Zhou Wen said a word, the phone hung up and a photo was sent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the photo and saw Zhou Lingfeng with a young woman. The woman looked to be in her thirties at most. She was elegant and beautiful, and she had a rather good presence. She looked different from the so-called beauties on the Internet. This lady had a sensual aesthetic and a unique presence that could hardly be described with words.</p>
<p>“How’s it? Your new mom isn’t too bad, right? Her name is Ouyang Lan,” Zhou Lingfeng called again and said smugly.</p>
<p>“Not bad, but she’s not my mom,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t mind Zhou Lingfeng getting remarried, he didn’t plan on acknowledging a new mother at his age. After all, Zhou Lingfeng wasn’t home most of the time and he was already accustomed to living alone. It was also not necessary that the lady would like baggage like him, so it would be quite nice if they led their own separate lives.</p>
<p>“My wife is naturally your mom. That’s an undeniable fact. By the way, my wedding is in a few days. You have to come, alright?” Zhou Lingfeng said indifferently, as though he took nothing to heart.</p>
<p>“Where is it? When is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Luoyang. In a week,” Zhou Lingfeng said.</p>
<p>“I’ll be taking the college entrance exams in a few days. The period you mentioned happens to clash with the combat test which I plan on participating in. I won’t be able to go even if I wanted,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.</p>
<p>He was willing to participate in the wedding, but he really couldn’t go.</p>
<p>“Wow, time passes so quickly. You are already having your college entrance exams.” Zhou Lingfeng clearly didn’t remember this as he made a poignant comment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expect his father to know it, but he was still somewhat disappointed hearing him say that. Perhaps Zhou Lingfeng had even forgotten that he was graduating from high school this year.</p>
<p>“Dad, do you know that metal biscuit tin inside our wardrobe?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Biscuit tin? What biscuit tin?” Zhou Lingfeng asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The one that’s about thirty centimeters long. It’s a biscuit tin that’s squarish and made of metal. It has a picture of a cartoon bear…” Zhou Wen described the biscuit tin’s characteristics in detail.</p>
<p>“Oh, that bear biscuit tin. I often ate from it when I was little. However, that brand of biscuits isn’t sold anymore. The one we have at home was probably left behind. Why are you asking about it?”</p>
<p>“Inside that bear biscuit tin is a cellphone. Did you put it in?” Zhou Wen’s heart raced slightly. That cellphone was the mysterious phone he was using.</p>

<p>“Cellphone?” Zhou Lingfeng was somewhat puzzled. Only after quite some time did he suddenly say, “Is the phone you’re talking about one with a completely white metal case and a black screen without any buttons. About five to six inches big?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Is that phone yours?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“No, it’s your grandfather’s. I’d have already forgotten about it if you hadn’t mentioned it,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a laugh. “That phone was your grandfather’s baby.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather’s baby? Where he did get it from?” Zhou Wen seemed to notice something amiss with Zhou Lingfeng’s tone as he pressed on.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng recounted the phone’s origins, leaving Zhou Wen quite surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s grandfather was a carpenter years ago; however, he wasn’t a carpenter who made tables or chairs. He could do those, but his focus was on building wooden buildings that mimicked ancient structures.</p>
<p>In the past, when Guide Ancient City was being rebuilt, they needed to preserve the ancient city’s former state, so the construction of many wooden buildings in the ancient style was needed. Zhou Wen’s father had taken the job and spent more than a year in the City.</p>
<p>During this period, an ancient dried well was excavated from the ancient city’s site. It was the graveyard shift, so there weren’t any outsiders around. Only Zhou Wen’s grandfather and a few workers were present.</p>
<p>When the ancient well was dug out, there was a glow that emitted from below. Imagining that they had dug out treasure, the workers came to an agreement and headed down to dig for it, hoping to strike it rich.</p>
<p>After they went down the well, they discovered an ancient rotting wooden case. The case had almost disintegrated, and there were many holes in it. It was from these holes that the light shone out.</p>
<p>The few workers brought the case up, imagining that there was some treasure in it. With just a few of them, they could split it and end up living in the lap of luxury for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>To their surprise, it was a cellphone. Although cellphones had just become widespread back then, it was no longer anything rare.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the phone was still lit in the beginning. After they took it out, the screen went black as though it had lost power. There weren’t any buttons on the phone, nor was there any charging port.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s grandfather and company were greatly disappointed, imagining that it was a prank. Since it looked broken without any value, everyone lost interest in it. Eventually, Zhou Wen’s grandfather threw it into a tool bag.</p>
<p>Later, it was brought back home. Zhou Wen’s grandfather didn’t throw it away and kept it in the storeroom. When Zhou Lingfeng was young, Zhou Wen’s grandfather had even told him the story. However, it was recounted like a horror story; thus, leaving quite a deep impression on Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>“That crappy phone can’t even be turned on. When I was young, I took it to a phone repair shop, hoping to sell it for a few packets of cigarettes, but the boss said it was worthless. So I just threw it into the biscuit tin. Don’t tell me you plan on selling it for money? Cellphones have such a short lifespan and they aren’t considered antiques. Old models aren’t worth anything,” Zhou Lingfeng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Thankfully, you didn’t manage to swap the phone for cigarettes; otherwise, me crying would be an understatement.</p>
<p>“The phone has never lit up before?” Zhou Wen asked further.</p>
<p>“How could it? It’s been sitting there for years. Ignoring the fact that it’s broken, even if it isn’t, it would have long run out of charge.” Zhou Lingfeng cut off Zhou Wen and said, “Alright. I have many things to tend to over here. Since I’ve already informed you, it’s up to you to come to the wedding.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Lingfeng hung up.</p>
<p>Something dug up from Guide Ancient City? Unfortunately, that place has already become a dimensional zone. Ordinary people have no way of going close. However, Guide City’s combat test is inside Guide Ancient City. I wonder where that ancient well is or if I have a chance of heading over to take a look. Zhou Wen thought about it but was without any clues.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Lingfeng had said, phones were something that were made in the last few decades. It was impossible for them to be antiques. Even if they were antiques, they couldn’t possess any mystical power.</p>
<p>“Damn it. I forgot to ask dad if he had offended anyone.” Zhou Wen was planning on calling again, but after some thought, he decided against it.</p>
<p>Since An Jing was gone and hadn’t really done anything to him, there was no point in raising it now that the matter was already over.</p>
<p>Taking out the mysterious phone, he opened the Ant Nest app and once again started his grinding.</p>
<p>The ants were killed by the blood-colored avatar as his in-game character behaved like him. Zhou Wen received all the experiences and lessons learned from combat.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was getting more experienced at killing Vigor Ants. He lasted much longer and could now kill four to five hundred Vigor Ants with just one life. In the past, he would usually succumb after killing about a hundred.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his luck today was nothing to speak of. Two Strength Crystals and a Constitution Crystal dropped. Furthermore, they were low in value and could only be used for energy replenishment. He wasn’t able to upgrade himself directly with them.</p>
<p>As he was getting pumped from the killing, he suddenly saw a red Mutated Vigor Ant appear. Delighted, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to rush over.</p>
<p>Before he had mastered Vigor Divine Fist, killing Mutated Vigor Ants was somewhat difficult, but this time, he delivered one Vigor Divine Fist immediately, blasting its head apart. Following that, he threw out another punch to blast its body apart.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A crisp sound was heard as a dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, there was only one.</p>
<p>“Killed Mutated Vigor Ant. Discovered Constitution Crystal.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that it had a value of 9, delighting him.</p>
<p>His Constitution was at 8, and with this Constitution Crystal, he could improve once again.</p>
<p>Constitution involved a person’s resilience and endurance. Only with high Constitution could someone fight prolonged battles without becoming exhausted. One would also be able to better withstand blows. The Ascetic Meditation he cultivated in mainly strengthened his Constitution and Strength.</p>
<p>Picking up the Constitution Crystal with the blood-colored avatar, a strange force was transmitted from the phone, instantly spreading across Zhou Wen’s body. It made every cell in him seem to come to life.</p>
<p>As he watched his in-game Constitution change to 9, Zhou Wen felt his body become significantly tougher. When ordinary Vigor Ants bit at his blood-colored avatar, the amount of health he lost was much less.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued grinding and discovered that such Mutant Vigor Ants occasionally appeared in the nest, but its spawning spot was random. Furthermore, they didn’t always drop dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>Later, Zhou Wen encountered two Mutated Vigor Ants again, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Time quickly passed amidst his grinding. Nothing changed. He slept through his classes and gamed after classes. Only during cultivation classes did he hone his teamwork with Fang Ruoxi and company.</p>
<p>However, over the past few days, Zhou Wen often felt that Yu Qiubai looked at him strangely. The latter was often smiling at him with narrowed eyes, creeping him out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter10'>Chapter 10: Companion Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Tian Xiangdong was training his fist techniques on the field, but from time to time, he would sneak a glance at Zhou Wen who was under a tree. He had been training for nearly an hour while Zhou Wen had spent the same amount of time gaming on the phone.</p>
<p>“It’s really exasperating to compare. We spend so much effort training, but that fellow just games.” Tian Xiangdong felt more depressed the more he looked.</p>
<p>After the past few days of training, Tian Xiangdong had learned something. The reason Zhou Wen was considered the best genius in Guide High School wasn’t solely because of his cultivation talent.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong had originally thought that cultivation akin to sailing against a current was suitable for all humans since humans weren’t machines. It was very easy to regress if one didn’t train daily.</p>
<p>It was especially so when putting theory into practice in actual combat. Some level of deviation would affect the timing of opportunities and distance placement.</p>
<p>But Zhou Wen was different. As long as he learned something, regardless of whether he trained or not, he appeared very skilled and natural when actually putting it to practice.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, Zhou Wen would join them when the quartet trained together. But when it was time for individual training, Zhou Wen would run to the side to game.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because Zhou Wen’s performance was impeccable when cooperating with the rest and, in fact, was the most outstanding one among the four, Tian Xiangdong might have taken on a teacher’s responsibility to teach the former a good lesson, inculcating in him the importance of daily practice and improvement.</p>
<p>But now, all Tian Xiangdong could do was sneak glances at Zhou Wen sitting there gaming while he had to engage in strenuous training.</p>
<p>“Where are you looking at? Focus. Your actions aren’t right,” Li Zhi said as he walked over.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong glanced at Zhou Wen who was just gaming and said in envy, “How nice it would be if I had talent like Zhou Wen. Cultivation is so miserable. Who doesn’t want to just game daily?”</p>
<p>Li Zhi said with a laugh, “Do you think Zhou Wen is really just gaming all day?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that so? He has so much fun gaming daily. It’s obvious for us all to see,” Tian Xiangdong said.</p>
<p>Li Zhi shook his head and said, “We can only see him when he’s in school. We have no idea what he does after school.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that he’s cultivating hard at home after school?” Tian Xiangdong understood what Li Zhi was getting at.</p>
<p>“There’s no free lunch in the world. A person like Zhou Wen might appear harmless as though he cares about nothing, but deep down in his bones, he’s extremely prideful. He suffered such a terrible defeat under An Jing’s hands, and although there might be extenuating circumstances for his defeat, with his character, he probably couldn’t accept it. He must have worked very hard at cultivation. This can be seen from how adept he is in actual combat. He’s definitely just putting on a farce that he’s decadent and engrossed in gaming,” Li Zhi said with a severe countenance.</p>
<p>“Then why does he act so decadent in school? There’s no need for him to do so. Isn’t it better to spend time gaming than on cultivation?” Tian Xiangdong was doubtful.</p>
<p>Li Zhi shot a glance at Zhou Wen and said, “I believe that he suffered quite a psychological setback when he was first defeated by An Jing, causing people to mistake him for wallowing in self-misery.”</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t explain why he games in school?” Tian Xiangdong was still puzzled.</p>
<p>“Think about it. If everyone believes you to be trash, and you end up scoring shockingly well on the college-entrance exams, taking first place in the city, wouldn’t it feel awesome to look back at the naysayers with a beaming look of success?” Li Zhi said.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Zhou Wen has such nefarious thoughts? That scumbag…” Tian Xiangdong instantly came to a realization as he nearly exclaimed. Thankfully, Li Zhi cupped his mouth in time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen obviously wasn’t as Tian Xiangdong imagined. Gaming similarly allowed him to grow stronger. Furthermore, the in-game character was equivalent to another him. When the in-game character was in combat, he would acquire the experience and skill familiarity from combat; therefore, he had no need to train.</p>
<p>“Mutated Vigor Ant!” Zhou Wen was grinding happily when he saw a blood-red Vigor Ant appear.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, he had killed more than ten Mutated Vigor Ants, but the outcome wasn’t anything desirable.</p>
<p>Apart from the first Mutated Vigor Ant dropping two dimensional crystals, the subsequent ones dropped dimensional crystals at a much lower rate. Their qualities were also worse.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, even dimensional crystals with a value of 9 were rare. They didn’t appear even after about ten Mutated Vigor Ants were killed.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t as excited as before when he saw Mutated Vigor Ants. He very calmly controlled the blood-colored avatar to proceed forward and deliver two Vigor Divine Fist strikes to kill it.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>He heard a familiar chime. Something had dropped this time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too excited. Even if a dimensional crystal dropped, it was useless even if it was valued at 7 or 8, unless they were Speed Crystals. They could only replenish his energy expenditure.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen identified the item that dropped, he was slightly taken aback. It was because the word “Crystal” wasn’t in the name of the item.</p>
<p>“Killed Mutated Vigor Ant. Discovered Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>A game notice popped up at the bottom left of the screen. It left Zhou Wen surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>Having a Companion Egg drop meant that he had a chance of possessing a Companion Beast. But based on what he knew, it was very rare for Companion Beasts to appear at the Mortal stage. One could usually only have one after reaching the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>It could be said that Companion Beasts were a manifestation of one’s strength and status. Humans that would take their Companion Beasts on the streets were basically experts at the Legendary stage or higher. They were respected and envied by others.</p>
<p>The reason people at the Mortal stage lacked Companion Beasts was that Mortal stage dimensional creatures almost never dropped Companion Beasts. Even Legendary stage dimensional creatures had a relatively low probability of dropping one. Furthermore, Legendary stage Companion Eggs required one to provide Legendary stage Primordial Energy to incubate it. Therefore, even if Mortal stage humans obtained a Companion Egg, they had no means to incubate it.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts that hatched after incubation would live and die with their masters. It was very difficult for them to be transferred. If a forceful transfer was made, an extremely huge price needed to be paid. The typical person had no way of achieving that.</p>
<p>In a tiny city like Guide City, Zhou Wen had never seen a human at the Mortal stage have a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg was about the size of the fist of the blood-colored avatar. It was completely milky-white and translucent. It was oval in shape and inside some red lights were flickering. It looked mysterious and beautiful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen eagerly made the blood-colored avatar pick up the Companion Egg. The moment it made contact, Zhou Wen felt a jolt through his body. As though extracted by a needle, his Primordial Energy instantly flowed towards the phone.</p>
<p>And in-game, the blood-colored avatar’s Primordial Energy instantly went from 9 to 0.</p>
<h3 id='chapter11'>Chapter 11: Mutated Vigor Ant</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen felt exhausted as though he had been sucked dry. The color in his face instantly drained as beads of sweat oozed out of his forehead.</p>
<p>In-game, the Companion Egg’s red stream of light brightened after it absorbed the Primordial Energy, dyeing the entire Companion Egg red, making it look like a blood crystal.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>It cracked open and a blood-colored Vigor Ant’s light projection flashed and entered the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen felt an odd force surge into his body. It was as though the force had a life of its own. Although it was indescribable, it was transmitting information to Zhou Wen in a magical manner.</p>
<p>“Pledge my life to follow you… Pledge my life to follow you… Pledge my life to follow you…”</p>
<p>As the voices sounded in Zhou Wen’s mind, the force in him gathered towards the back of his left hand. Slowly it formed a blood-colored ant symbol like a tattoo made from blood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously pulled his sleeves down and shrank his left hand in to prevent others from seeing the ant symbol on the back of it.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts had an extremely mystical existence. They were like parasites that live on humans, living and dying with their masters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look at the in-game information. Indeed, there was an additional entry of Mutated Vigor Ant at Companion Beast. Then, he took another look at the Mutated Vigor Ant’s stats.</p>
<p>Mutated Vigor Ant: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 9</p>
<p>Speed: 5</p>
<p>Constitution: 9</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 9</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 9)</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted seeing this. A Mutated Vigor Ant’s stats could match a top Mortal stage human and it had a Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist. If he summoned it out, it was equivalent to having another hatchet man as strong as him. It could even be more ferocious than Zhou Wen since his Vigor Divine Fist was Rank 7 while it was at Rank 9.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was eager to immediately summon the Mutated Vigor Ant to see what it looked like in real life, since all he saw in-game was a Mutated Vigor Ant drawn in a cartoon style. He had no idea what it really looked like.</p>
<p>However, with him being in school, Zhou Wen could only resist his desire.</p>
<p>A Mortal stage Companion Beast would probably attract plenty of attention if he summoned it in school. Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t have any good explanation for the Mutated Vigor Ant’s origins.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong couldn’t help but sneakily size up Zhou Wen. Upon seeing him, he said in a depressed tone, “Look at Zhou Wen. He’s gaming until he’s pale and breaking out into a cold sweat. He looks so frail. If I hadn’t seen his Strength and Primordial Energy Skill with my own eyes, I would really think that he was a sickly fellow.”</p>
<p>Little did he know that the reason for Zhou Wen’s sickly look was because he had been using his blood to revive himself in-game over the past month. Although one drop of blood each time wasn’t a lot, the numerous times he did so still caused him to lose a shocking amount of blood. This made Zhou Wen look somewhat pale and weak as though he was malnourished or suffering from anemia.</p>
<p>This was also one of the reasons why Yu Qiubai and the others believed that he was being decadent. That pale face was like a perfect example of someone wallowing in self-misery.</p>
<p>After returning home from school, Zhou Wen drew the curtains. Only then did he summon the Mutated Vigor Ant in his living room.</p>
<p>The symbol on the back of his hand burst out in a resplendent sanguine light. The symbol’s blood color seemed to come to life as it turned into a stream of blood that flowed over his palm and soon enveloped it within, turning it into a boxing glove that was neither gold or jade. On the back of the boxing glove was the symbol of a Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the boxing glove on his left hand. He felt an explosive force fill his left fist as though he could blast apart a tank if he threw it out.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s just like the livestreams on the Internet. Companion Beasts provide an augmentation effect in a companion state. A Vigor Ant augments Strength, right? Unable to test the augmented effects of the boxing glove at home, Zhou Wen could only put it away and switch to summoning the Mutated Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>As the Mutated Vigor Ant symbol on the back of his hand shimmered, a strange blood-colored projection appeared in front of him. The projection gradually materialized, turning into a blood-colored ant the size of a racehorse.</p>
<p>A Mutated Vigor Ant in real life was in no way as adorable as the cartoon version in-game. Its blood-red carapace appeared to be cast from metal. Its physical contours seemed to contain infinite explosive strength. Its long, slender ant legs were like saws. The feelers on its head looked like resilient steel pieces.</p>
<p>Ignoring being pierced by its leg, just being slammed by its body would probably result in fractures and debilitation.</p>
<p>It left a strong impact on him when he observed it up close. It had a dangerous beauty that looked somewhat demonic. While it left one shuddering in fear, it also prompted one to subdue it.</p>
<p>The game’s depiction really can’t be counted on. Such a ferocious killing machine actually looks so cute in-game. Zhou Wen swung himself onto the back of the Mutated Vigor Ant and made it circle the living room.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the living room was too small, making it difficult for the Mutated Vigor Ant to turn around. He didn’t experience much of a thrill as a result.</p>
<p>I’ll try riding you out when I next have a chance. Unless necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting others know of the existence of the Mutated Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>Although Mortal stage Companion Beasts were rare, they were much weaker than Legendary stage Companion Beasts. It was pointless showing it off.</p>
<p>However, the dropping of the Companion Egg made Zhou Wen more diligent. He continued striving hard with the phone, hoping to see what other drops he could get from the Ant Nest.</p>
<p>With the college entrance exams approaching, Zhou Wen went into school earlier, hoping to sleep in class. The moment he reached the school’s entrance, he saw Tian Xiangdong standing there with an odd expression.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen walk over, Tian Xiangdong hurriedly came forward, wearing an odd look on his face. He gritted his teeth and said, “Zhou Wen, I’m sorry. My friend invited me to join his team. I can’t be in the same team as you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Tian Xiangdong didn’t wait for him to say another word before running off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, unsure what was wrong with the fellow. The test was about to begin, yet here he was switching teams.</p>
<p>I wonder if Fang Ruoxi has any backup plans for Tian Xiangdong quitting the team. It’s not easy to find another teammate this late. Zhou Wen walked into the school as he thought about the matter only to find Li Zhi standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“Li Zhi, do you know about Tian Xiangdong quitting the team?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Li Zhi was taken aback before he looked at him with an odd expression. “I’m sorry. For some reason, I can’t take the combat test with you either.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Li Zhi and felt an ominous feeling rise in him.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Zhi and asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask. It’s my bad.” Li Zhi wore a look of guilt and bowed before quickly walking away.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Fang Ruoxi, he could tell from the look on her face what she was about to say.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Zhou Wen. I can’t take the combat test with you.” Fang Ruoxi came in front of him and remained silent for a long while before speaking.</p>
<h3 id='chapter12'>Chapter 12: The Influence of One Sentence</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen stared into Fang Ruoxi’s eyes and asked.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi’s gaze dodged his, unwilling for their eyes to meet. She shook her head slightly and said, “Don’t ask. In short, it’s my fault.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and reached out to press onto Fang Ruoxi’s head. He ruffled her hair and said, “I should be the one apologizing. Someone is out to get me; thus putting you, Tian Xiangdong, and Li Zhi in a difficult position. Now that there’s still time, get another teammate. Make sure to do well, or I’ll feel uneasy. Also, help me apologize to Tian Xiangdong and Li Zhi.”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi stared at Zhou Wen blankly. Her face wore a complicated expression. It was a lost, guilty, confused look with a hint of abnormality.</p>
<p>“Alright, move along. I need to work hard as well.” Zhou Wen retracted his palm as he left with a smile.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi stood there watching his back and after he had walked quite a distance away, she said with her body trembling, “Zhou Wen, I’ve no idea who you offended, but that person wields great power. You have to be careful.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. All he did was turn his head and smile at her before briskly walking away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he didn’t have much time left. Li Zhi’s family was ordinary, but Tian Xiangdong belonged to one of the most powerful families in Guide City. Furthermore, Fang Ruoxi’s family was even better. Rumor had it that her father was a high official in the city and someone with plenty of power.</p>
<p>Someone who had the ability to influence; all three must wield extraordinary power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out who he could have offended, but connecting it to An Jing’s transferring to fight him had clues left behind.</p>
<p>Coming to a spot devoid of anyone else, Zhou Wen took out his phone, thinking of asking his father if he had offended anyone.</p>
<p>However, there was only the voice message that the phone was not in service. He didn’t know what Zhou Lingfeng was up to for him to not even switch on his phone in the day.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen contemplated his subsequent plans.</p>
<p>The most important goal now is to find three students who are willing to join me in the combat test. Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>The combat test was different from the other subjects in the college entrance exam. As it was held in the dimensional zone and although humans had already obtained control over the dimensional zones, reducing the dangers involved, there were still a number of casualties from the yearly test. Therefore, the combat test needed to be voluntary and the team formed freely.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what method of testing the League government would choose for the test. Every year, the result of casualties would result in a massive debate, but the combat test still continued every year. There weren’t any signs of the League changing the situation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind danger. With his present strength, even if he were to join the combat test alone, he was still bound to receive stellar results.</p>
<p>However, it was a rule by the League government. It required four students from the same school to participate. Therefore, before the application deadline, he needed to find three students who were willing to form a team with him.</p>
<p>I’m still a few days away from the college entrance exam. The students who are willing to take the combat test probably already have their own teams. How am I to find people to form a team? Zhou Wen was rather vexed.</p>
<p>In the beginning, all he wanted was to apply to a reputable school and find a stable job. Then, he could game in peace, but someone didn’t seem willing to give him his peace. They were bent on messing things up.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, follow me.” Just as Zhou Wen reached the classroom, Yu Qiubai called out to him.</p>
<p>He had a nasty expression as he took Zhou Wen back to his office. After closing the door, he looked at him and with a grave expression, asked, “Zhou Wen, do you know Overseer An?”</p>
<p>“Who is he?” Zhou Wen asked blankly.</p>
<p>“Overseer An is an honorific title that also includes his rank. His real name is An Tianzuo. Do you really not know him?” Yu Qiubai asked Zhou Wen again with glaring eyes.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head firmly.</p>
<p>Noticing that Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be hiding anything, Yu Qiubai revealed a look of puzzlement. “That’s strange. If you do not know Overseer An, why did he criticize a high schooler like you when he came to inspect Guide City?”</p>
<p>“What kind of background does An Tianzuo have?” Zhou Wen got a rough idea about the reason Fang Rouxi and the rest had quit the team. It was likely to do with An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai wore a bitter smile. “I’m only a teacher. I have no chance of coming close to a figure like that. I’ve only heard the principal mention a person like that. Earth’s League is split into four districts—north, south, east, and west, and Guide City is just a tiny city in East District. Although Overseer An Tianzuo is young, he comes from an illustrious family. In his twenties, he enjoys a high rank and is a high official in the East District’s military. He wields plenty of power and is an impressive figure.”</p>
<p>“Sir, are you implying that An Tianzuo is targeting me?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not, but he said one sentence criticizing you. However, the people who were trying to be cozy with him are free to think and do many things,” Yu Qiubai said helplessly.</p>
<p>“As a high official, doesn’t he know that a mere sentence is enough to destroy the future of a high schooler?” Zhou Wen said coldly. “Could this Overseer An be related to An Jing?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, probably. As for what the exact relationship is, I’ve no idea either.” Yu Qiubai thought for a moment and said, “We can figure this out later. It’s imperative we find you a team to participate in the combat test. The day after tomorrow is the deadline. We don’t have time to spare.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said helplessly, “At this point in time, the students who are willing to take the combat test already have their teams. How am I to find others? Besides, even if I found one, can’t the dismantling of my team happen a second time?”</p>
<p>“Therefore, the teammates you will be finding this time must not be ordinary students.” Yu Qiubai appeared to already have a plan.</p>
<p>“Not ordinary students?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, confused as to what Yu Qiubai was getting at.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai pondered for a moment and said, “The combat test requires four students to freely form a team. This rule has a huge loophole, but the League has insisted on keeping it without changing it for decades. Under such rules, many students who aren’t too strong but have extremely powerful teammates have obtained results that don’t match their ability.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Yu Qiubai continued, “Our school has a student named Li Xuan. If you are willing to form a team with him, and as long as he’s willing, I doubt anyone will make it difficult for you. However, you have to ensure that he receives good results in exchange. Furthermore, he needs to be the one doing the best on the team.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me I’ll be carrying Li Xuan?” Zhou Wen wasn’t a fool, so he naturally understood what Yu Qiubai was getting at.</p>
<p>“Under normal circumstances, you naturally wouldn’t have to do so. But in the present circumstances, although you won’t get first in the team, you will still receive quite remarkable results. You just won’t be first. This will be much better than not being able to participate at all.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a stubborn person. Without any hesitation, he said, “Sir, I’ll be troubling you to help me then. However, does our school really have a student named Li Xuan?”</p>
<p>If Guide High School really had a student with such a striking background, there was no reason for him not to know.</p>
<p>“Although Li Xuan is a student at our school, he has never come to school except on matriculation day. It’s normal that you don’t know him. Even amongst the teachers, few of them know of him,” Yu Qiubai said with a smile. “In short, let’s get over this obstacle first. You can leave any considerations to the future.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter13'>Chapter 13: Step-Siblings</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>After leaving Yu Qiubai’s office, Zhou Wen took out his phone and tried to call his dad, Zhou Lingfeng. No matter how he thought about it, it was impossible for him to offend a figure like An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>For An Tianzuo to know him, a high schooler from a tiny city, and then criticize him by name was truly inexplicable.</p>
<p>This time, the phone call connected as Zhou Lingfeng’s voice sounded. “Son, missing daddy so soon?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already used to Zhou Lingfeng’s character. Unmoved, he directly asked, “Dad, do you know a person named An Tianzuo?”</p>
<p>“Tianzuo? Of course.” Upon saying that, Zhou Lingfeng exclaimed in surprise. “Hey, how do you know that Tianzuo is your elder brother? I don’t think I’ve introduced the two of you.”</p>
<p>“My elder brother?” Zhou Wen was left somewhat stunned.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Tianzuo is Little Lan’s son. I married Little Lan, so he’s naturally your stepbrother. By the way, you also have a stepsister named An Jing…” He had slipped effortlessly into addressing his fiancée by an affectionate diminutive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t manage to hear the rest of what Zhou Lingfeng had to say. It was because he was so shocked. The development had exceeded his imagination. Zhou Lingfeng had actually married such a woman.</p>
<p>“Dad, how’s your relationship with An Tianzuo?” Zhou Wen tried probing.</p>
<p>“Great. Tianzuo and Little Jing honor me greatly. We have a very good relationship,” Zhou Lingfeng answered without much thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood his father’s character. It was unlikely that he was lying. However, he couldn’t help but feel bitter deep down. If An Tianzuo and An Jing really have a good relationship with Zhou Lingfeng, why would they be treating me this way? Could it be that they aren’t agreeable to dad’s marriage with Ouyang Lan?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense Zhou Lingfeng’s good mood and how happy he was about his impending wedding. He didn’t wish to affect Zhou Lingfeng’s wedding because of his matters, much less be a burden on him.</p>
<p>If An Tianzuo and An Jing had treated him that way because they didn’t want Zhou Lingfeng to marry Ouyang Lan, he didn’t want his problems to affect Zhou Lingfeng’s wedding. Otherwise, he would fall into their plans.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t met An Tianzuo before, nor did he know what motives An Tianzuo had, Zhou Wen had a terrible impression of him.</p>
<p>Regardless of how powerful the An family is, it has nothing to do with me. I have no plans on benefiting myself through the An family. This family is really going too far. Although Zhou Wen now knew the underlying reasons, it was meaningless.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if he could tell others that An Tianzuo was pissed off because his dad had hit on his mom, thus also making him a sore sight to An Tianzuo, right?</p>
<p>Not only couldn’t he say it, but even if he said it out loud, it wasn’t going to change the situation he was in.</p>
<p>An Jing was able to defeat me with one strike. An Tianzuo’s one sentence nearly made me lose the qualification to take the combat test. At the end of the day, it’s because I’m too weak. I can only be bullied when I lack strength. If I were an Epic stage expert, would they dare do this to me? Zhou Wen wasn’t someone to bemoan his fate. He quickly put the matter aside and focused on grinding on the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Guide High School’s former principal once commended Zhou Wen for being the most focused person he had ever met.</p>
<p>Focused sounded like a very ordinary commendation, but to truly be focused was an insurmountable feat.</p>
<p>Humans weren’t saints. They had all kinds of desires and emotions that made them prone to enticement and disturbance. Even gods were no exception. Buddha suffered the temptation of Mara the demon, so what chance did mere mortals have?</p>
<p>Many people claim studying to be difficult, but that was because they were unable to fully focus on their studies, nor did they have the ability to maintain that focused state.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. No matter what he did or no matter what the environment was, it was very easy for him to enter a focused state as he put a hundred percent into it. It was very difficult for him to be influenced by external factors; thus, the reason the former principal had made such a remark about Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In-game, Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beast, the Mutated Vigor Ant. Although it also had 9 for Constitution, this fellow’s carapace was hard and its defense was much stronger than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar rode on the Mutated Vigor Ant, storming through the Ant Nest. Even a horde of Vigor Ants besieging him was no longer a worry.</p>
<p>When the Mutated Vigor Ant struck with its front pincers, it killed ordinary Vigor Ants with one strike. With its hard carapace, it remained invincible amongst the hordes.</p>
<p>“If only I had a spear.” Zhou Wen discovered that by riding on the Mutated Vigor Ant’s back, the blood-colored avatar could hardly hit the Vigor Ants around it due to the distance. It had to jump off the Mutated Vigor Ant’s back and fight alongside it.</p>
<p>Ever since he had obtained the mysterious crystal, Zhou Wen had never had such a good time grinding. The man and ant basically wiped out everything in their path as they stormed through the map. Whenever they met Mutated Vigor Ants, they could quickly kill them with their combined forces.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen was only able to grind in the opening area, dying before he could reach deeper. Now, he was able to storm all the way in, quickly allowing him to enter areas he had never entered before.</p>
<p>With so many Vigor Ants killed, two dimensional crystals dropped, but they were of very low values. Zhou Wen only replenished some of his energy after absorbing them.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>After killing another Mutated Vigor Ant, Zhou Wen heard a familiar sound. On careful look, he was delighted. This time, it was a dimensional crystal—a Vigor Ant Crystal at Rank 9.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to pick it up, instantly feeling a jolt of electricity surge into his body as it blasted through his circulation.</p>
<p>His Vigor Divine Fist instantly rose from Rank 7 to Rank 9.</p>
<p>His Vigor Divine Fist might raise once again at Rank 9. However, the amount of Primordial Energy drained increased as well. Each usage expended 5 Primordial Energy. With only 9 Primordial Energy points, he was unable to use Vigor Divine Fist twice in short periods of time.</p>
<p>With this new addition, Zhou Wen lost himself to grinding. The man and ant slaughtered through the Ant Nest, leaving a wake of destruction as they forged deep into the nest.</p>
<p>The Ant Nest was like a huge underground maze. After nearly two hours of killing, he finally saw its end. The cave ahead seemed to become broader as the passageway became wide as though he was entering a large warehouse.</p>
<p>As he was storming through the horde of ants, he suddenly saw a silver glimmer of light. All Zhou Wen saw was a strange ant with silver wings sweep above the blood-colored avatar, and the next second, the latter’s head flew into midair. The game screen then went black.</p>
<h3 id='chapter14'>Chapter 14: Li Xuan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>A silver ant that can fly. Could it be a Legendary stage dimensional creature? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>He had planned on reviving the blood-colored avatar and heading for the area where the silver flying ant had appeared, but with noon almost approaching, Zhou Wen could only put it on hold.</p>
<p>Although Yu Qiubai had tacitly allowed him to skip classes, he had arranged for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to meet at noon. Therefore, Zhou Wen needed to make the trip.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that they would meet in school, but to his surprise, Yu Qiubai drove Zhou Wen out of school after morning classes and arrived at a private club east of the city.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan is quite someone with an ostentatious character, but he’s not a bad person. You are only here for the test, so don’t take anything else to heart.” Before entering the club, Yu Qiubai exhorted Zhou Wen with deep underlying tones.</p>
<p>“Sir, don’t worry. I know what I should do,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared, he was still somewhat surprised when he saw Li Xuan inside a luxurious private room.</p>
<p>A teenager who looked about sixteen was sitting on a huge sofa. His shirt was untidy and frivolous and around him were beauties.</p>
<p>“Old Yu, come and have a drink,” the teenager raised his glass of alcohol when he saw Yu Qiubai, slipping effortlessly into addressing him by an affectionate diminutive.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that. I still have classes this afternoon.” Yu Qiubai seemed accustomed to this. As though not noticing the sexy ladies, he pointed to Zhou Wen and introduced, “Li Xuan, this is the Zhou Wen I mentioned before. He’s very capable and should be of some help for your test.”</p>
<p>“Old Yu, don’t worry. On your account, I’ll let him join me. Getting a pretty good result won’t be a problem,” Li Xuan downed his alcohol and said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Hearing you say that puts me at ease. I still have lessons so I’ll be heading back to school. Have a discussion with Zhou Wen about the combat test,” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>“Old Yu, are you really not going to have any drinks? The alcohol and women here are really good.” Li Xuan said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the offer. I still have classes, so I’ll be heading back.” Yu Qiubai waved his hand and said to Zhou Wen, “Leave the application to me. Stay here for the next few days to familiarize yourself with Li Xuan and the rest. It will be good for you during the combat test.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sir.” Zhou Wen was rather moved.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai had no ties with him; yet, he was helping him at the risk of offending An Tianzuo. It left him feeling very grateful.</p>
<p>“By getting into a reputable school and having a decent future is a way to not let me and the former principal down.” Yu Qiubai patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said with a smile, “Alright, I’ll be heading back. Have a good discussion with Li Xuan about the details.”</p>
<p>After Yu Qiubai left, Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan who was reveling amidst the embraces of the beauties. He asked, “Do we get the other two teammates here and do some teamwork training before the test begins?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes and said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, right? I’ve heard of you, the number one genius in Guide High School.”</p>
<p>“Just some random rumors. Don’t treat it seriously,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. In a small city like Guide City, how can there be a real genius? If you were really a genius, you wouldn’t have been defeated by An Jing’s single strike,” Li Xuan said languidly. “There’s no need for any teamwork practice. I’m allowing you to join my team solely because of Old Yu. When the time comes, make sure you follow obediently behind us and not give us trouble.”</p>
<p>“That works,” Zhou Wen said, unfazed.</p>
<p>“Do you drink? If you can finish this bottle, I’ll let you choose from them.” Li Xuan placed a bottle of alcohol in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t drink.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Up to you.” Li Xuan found Zhou Wen boring and ignored him as he began having fun himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found a corner to sit down and began gaming on his phone, continuing his grinding fest.</p>
<p>He wasn’t interested in staying here, but since Yu Qiubai had requested he stay behind, he didn’t think it was right to leave. Therefore, he just stayed behind to game.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen sitting motionless in the corner gaming, Li Xuan had a feeling of contempt for him. To wallow in self-misery just because of a little setback. For this good-for-nothing, Old Yu had to beg me. It wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Li Xuan’s heart stirred. He whispered to a sexy girl beside him.</p>
<p>“You’re naughty.” The girl jokingly snapped back as she walked towards Zhou Wen with her hips swaying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was busy grinding, eager to rush back to where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was. He wanted to know what level the dimensional creature was.</p>
<p>Just as he was getting into it, he suddenly felt a softness touching his arm. Then, a sweet voice rang in his ear. “Hey Handsome, what’s this game? Is it fun?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen continued grinding without looking up. After all, even if they saw the game, the cartoon-styled ants and the interface made it difficult for one to connect it to the dangerous dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Besides, Zhou Wen had never heard of a dimensional zone that was an ant nest.</p>
<p>When the girl saw Zhou Wen ignoring her, she subconsciously bit her lip. Then, she reached out to caress his cheek. She slightly used some force as she turned Zhou Wen’s head towards her as she leaned into his ear and breathed out. “What’s so fun about the game? Why not play a game with me?”</p>
<p>As Li Xuan drank, he watched Zhou Wen’s reaction with piqued interest. He thought to himself, Zhou Wen is such a gaming addict. He probably has never touched a woman’s body, much less a woman as coquettish as Xiaoya. Will he end up with a nose bleed as a result?</p>
<p>Xiaoya had only thought of turning Zhou Wen’s face slightly. Under such situations, men would automatically look at her, but despite doing so, Zhou Wen’s face was unmovable, like a rock. His eyes were still peeled to the phone screen.</p>
<p>A little peeved, Xiaoya exerted some strength, and forcibly turned Zhou Wen’s head. As she used too much strength, Zhou Wen’s cheeks were a little deformed from the squishing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was grinding and was unwilling to be unfocused. The blood-colored avatar was amidst a horde of Vigor Ants, so any moment of distraction led to possible death—the loss of one drop of blood.</p>
<p>Over the past month, Zhou Wen had been using his blood to game. With so much blood being expended, he was beginning to suffer from anemia; therefore, he didn’t even wish to lose one drop.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was facing her because of her twisting, Xiaoya realized that his eyes were still diagonally peeled to his phone screen. Enraged, she reached out her other hand and held his face with both hands. She turned his head even more, making Zhou Wen have no choice but to look at her. Then, she revealed a mesmerizing smile and said sweetly, “Stop gaming. Let’s have some drinks, alright?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter15'>Chapter 15: Don’t Disturb My Gaming</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s gaze was forced away from the phone screen, he immediately frowned.</p>
<p>He had just seen a Mutated Vigor Ant rush over and if he didn’t control his blood-colored avatar to take on the battle, it could easily lead to a “GAME OVER.”</p>
<p>Without having the luxury of time to think, Zhou Wen only wished to shift his gaze back to his phone. He instantly extended his hand and pressed it against Xiaoya’s face. With a slight nudge, he said, “Don’t disturb my gaming.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use much of his strength, but he had forgotten how substantially his Strength had increased recently. Xiaoya hadn’t cultivated at all, so her physical constitution was inferior to even the typical high schooler.</p>
<p>This casual push ended up pushing Xiaoya entirely backward as she plopped to the ground.</p>
<p>“Pfft!” Upon seeing Zhou Wen pushing Xiaoya to the ground with a look of contempt, Li Xuan spewed out a mouthful of alcohol as he choked and coughed.</p>
<p>The room instantly fell silent as the eight sexy girls looked at Zhou Wen as though he was a monster.</p>
<p>Xiaoya was half-slumped on the ground as she wore a look of disbelief. She next felt aggrieved and furious. As she got to her feet, she cursed, “Why resort to violence? Serves you right to be single!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was focused on killing the Mutated Vigor Ant and hadn’t noticed her rage. He ignored her and continued rapidly firing commands into his phone.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Xiaoya’s aggrieved look, Li Xuan was amused. This punk’s quite interesting!</p>
<p>Xiaoya was a headliner at this private club. Although her demeanor was inferior to the top escorts in the big cities, her figure was unparalleled. Even Li Xuan found Xiaoya excellent in everything other than her demeanor, speech, and actions. She left him rather mesmerized.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s look of contempt when he pushed her amused him greatly.</p>
<p>If it isn’t because this punk is a naturally insensitive man, there’s a high chance that he has gynophobia because of the beating he suffered under An Jing, a woman. Li Xuan thought without any ill intent.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat there gaming the entire time. Li Xuan quickly lost his interest in him and began reveling in fun again.</p>
<p>The entire club’s top floor had been reserved by Li Xuan. There was everything one needed. Li Xuan’s ignorance of Zhou Wen was something the latter enjoyed as well. He could keep grinding in-game.</p>
<p>After storming the Ant Nest for an hour, Zhou Wen once again arrived at the area he had previously spotted the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Indeed, it had grown a pair of silver wings and its entire body was silver like the typical flying ant.</p>
<p>It was extremely fast and even though Zhou Wen was prepared, he wasn’t able to last long against it. Soon, he had his chest impaled by the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as it flew across the sky.</p>
<p>It was extremely fast and it was very agile in midair. It was able to change trajectory like a bat, causing Zhou Wen’s Vigor Divine Fist to be of no use against it. He couldn’t hit it.</p>
<p>Although the Silver-Winged Flying Ant is powerful, it’s unlikely to have reached the Legendary stage. Killing it isn’t impossible, but I need to make careful plans. Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>From his observations, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Strength and Constitution were not weaker than that of the Mutated Vigor Ant. Furthermore, its speed was much faster than the Mutated Vigor Ant. This was also why it was so difficult to beat.</p>
<p>Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist was likely capable of injuring the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but without being able to touch it, no amount of Strength mattered.</p>
<p>Also, the ant horde’s influence on Zhou Wen was significant. Although Zhou Wen and his Mutated Vigor Ant weren’t afraid of a huge group of Vigor Ants, it severely restricted his freedom of movement, making him unable to dodge the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s attacks in the confined space.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, to kill it, I need to deliver the attack at the moment it approaches. However, it’s not easy to grasp the opportunity. Zhou Wen entered the game again and as he stormed towards the area where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant resided, he considered how he could seize the opportunity to deliver a counterattack.</p>
<p>After about an hour, Zhou Wen once again arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. At the instant the latter charged and appeared above the blood-colored avatar, Zhou Wen threw out Vigor Divine Fist in a bid to kill it.</p>
<p>However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s body did a bizarre twist when it was less than half a feet from Zhou Wen’s fist. While dodging the Vigor Divine Fist, its blade-like claws decapitated the blood-colored avatar from the back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made repeated attempts, but all of them ended with failure. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was just too nimble and his Vigor Divine Fist just couldn’t touch it.</p>
<p>The only time he hit the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was when he used Inch Punch. He threw out the punch when it was extremely close to him and had successfully hit it.</p>
<p>However, Inch Punch wasn’t augmented like a Primordial Energy Skill. It wasn’t too effective when hitting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and failed to seriously damage it.</p>
<p>If only Vigor Divine Fist can deliver strength just like Inch Punch. That way, I don’t have to waste so much time swinging my arm. I’ll then have the chance of releasing my strength instantaneously when it’s in close proximity to kill it. Unfortunately, Vigor Divine Fist is an in-game technique… That’s not right… The in-game character is no different from me. If I’m able to use Vigor Divine Fist like Inch Punch, I’ll be able to deliver explosive strength at short distances. As such, my in-game character will also be able to do it… Realizing this, Zhou Wen put away his phone and began experimenting with how he could deliver Vigor Divine Fist using the principles of Inch Punch.</p>
<p>Vigor Divine Fist was a very open and showy move, a Primordial Energy Skill that delivered a critical strike. When delivering it, he had to make some huge retracting moves, somewhat different from Inch Punch. Clearly, to modify Vigor Divine Fist’s delivery to be similar to Inch Punch’s was very difficult.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made repeated attempts and although it was very difficult, he wasn’t willing to give up.</p>
<p>Li Xuan woke up from his nap and saw Zhou Wen throwing out punches again and again in the corner as if he was practicing punching.</p>
<p>He didn’t pay much notice at first, imagining that Zhou Wen was tired from gaming and was simply stretching his body. However, when he realized Zhou Wen was still punching two hours later, he couldn’t help but observe.</p>
<p>This is Inch Punch? But the way strength is delivered and the magnitude of the movement is too much. It’s terrible. Li Xuan lost interest after watching for a moment. Zhou Wen’s punches weren’t anything worth watching.</p>
<p>Two days before the college entrance exams, Zhou Wen kept trying to fuse the Vigor Divine Fist and Inch Punch together. He had a brief inkling of what was needed but was unable to fully master it.</p>
<p>Time quickly passed and the college entrance exams began. The first three days were ordinary high school subjects. After Yu Qiubai came with their candidate passes, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan headed for their exam centers separately and completed their own examinations.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, Zhou Wen came to the combat test venue and met up with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The combat test was held in a dimensional zone. As every dimensional zone was different, there were some differences in the combat test across districts.</p>
<p>Guide City’s combat test was held in Guide Ancient City. In the dimensional storms decades ago, a dimensional rift opened, turning the area into a dimensional zone.</p>
<h3 id='chapter16'>Chapter 16: Downloading</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The vegetation outside the ancient city was abnormally luxuriant. The moat’s banks were lined with willow trees, all more than ten meters tall. Even the normal grass on the roadside was half an adult’s height.</p>
<p>The moat’s surface was filled with lotuses the size of boats. The lotus flowers were the size of a face washbasin and they presented a strange redness as though they were dyed in blood.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the dimensional zone, the nearby animals had experienced different levels of mutations. However, the mutations weren’t as serious as those inside the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Stationed outside the ancient city were armed soldiers with tanks patrolling the area. Without an entry pass, no one was allowed into the ancient city.</p>
<p>There were even surface-to-air missiles installed in the vicinity. However, Zhou Wen had never seen those missiles launch.</p>
<p>In fact, the threat firearms had on dimensional creatures was highly limited. Little damage would be incurred even if a nuclear bomb were to explode inside a dimensional zone. It would lead to more dimensional creatures absorbing the radioactive energies and mutating to become more terrifying.</p>
<p>Ordinary bullets were even more useless. When shot at dimensional creatures, they would be devoured and fuse with them.</p>
<p>Only bullets made from special materials could generate damage on dimensional creatures, but those materials were very rare to begin with. Making such expendable bullets was wasteful, so they were typically made into melee weapons like swords and sabers.</p>
<p>Firearms were not very useful against dimensional creatures, but they still dealt plenty of damage on humans. These days, the main usage of such weapons was solely to maintain order in human society.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have an entry pass, but his candidate pass could be used as one. During the combat test, these passes allowed a single entry into Guide Ancient City via the north gate.</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City had four gates at the four directions. It was originally a small city, and circling the entire city didn’t even cover more than five kilometers.</p>
<p>However, after the dimensional storms, Guide Ancient City became a dimensional zone. The space within became several times bigger than it originally was. To date, humans had yet to completely explore the whole of it.</p>
<p>Entry via the different gates allowed one to encounter different dimensional creatures. The creatures encountered from the north gate were the weakest. Typically not much danger, as long as one didn’t venture too deep.</p>
<p>As the candidate pass only allowed four people to enter together after a verification process, Zhou Wen could only stand outside the ancient city’s gate to wait for Li Xuan and the two other teammates who Zhou Wen had never met. Luckily there was still some time before the entrance closed.</p>
<p>The ancient city’s north gate was ancient and mysterious. Its bricks were mottled and worn, with many spots having signs of weathering.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had heard of stories in which the troops had bombarded Guide Ancient City with massive amounts of ordnance for more than ten minutes. Yet, not a single tile, from the seemingly desolate ancient city, shattered.</p>
<p>Above the city gate was a board with the words “Guide City” written in traditional text. They had an ancient and vigorous flair with a lingering charm that went back a thousand years.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze finally fell onto the strange symbol at the end of the gate’s board.</p>
<p>The symbol looked like a palm-sized indentation left by a baby’s palm. However, inside the mark was an engraved pattern that looked like a bulb of garlic or onion.</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City naturally hadn’t had such a symbol in the past. Legend had it that this strange symbol appeared after the dimensional storms, but no one knew the meaning of it. Nor did anyone know who had engraved it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying the symbol when he suddenly felt the phone in his pocket vibrate.</p>
<p>Believing that Yu Qiubai or Li Xuan was looking for him, Zhou Wen reached into his pocket to take it out. But he was left momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>This was because the phone inside that pocket wasn’t the phone he usually used. Instead, it was the mysterious phone. It didn’t have any calling functionality, nor had it ever vibrated. So why would it suddenly do so now?</p>
<p>Seeing no one around him was looking, Zhou Wen took out the phone from his pocket and saw that the screen had automatically lit up. A camera icon was flashing on it.</p>
<p>Why didn’t I see this camera app in the past? What use does it have? Does it want me to take a selfie? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he tapped the camera icon.</p>
<p>Like an ordinary phone, it entered photography mode. However, it wasn’t taking a picture of Zhou Wen. The rear camera had been activated.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the ancient city didn’t restrict photography. Therefore, the soldiers didn’t approach to stop him despite seeing him taking out his phone to take a picture.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen raised the phone and pointed it at the vegetation beside him in an attempt to figure out the uses of the photography function.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that it was apparently broken. There was no way for him to press the shutter button to take the picture.</p>
<p>The phone still wouldn’t take a picture of the scenery despite Zhou Wen’s finger tapping the screen. There wasn’t any reaction.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Zhou Wen raised his phone and waved it around. When the city gate’s tiny hand symbol appeared on screen, there was a beep. Surprisingly, the phone responded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he took a careful look. He realized that there was a green box that appeared on screen that locked onto the strange palm symbol above the city gate.</p>
<p>After three consecutive beeps, the palm symbol was zoomed in. The ancient city in the background gradually blurred and the words beneath appeared: “Loading…”</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen looked at his phone with the loading screen as a thought flashed across his mind. This thought gave him a fright as he found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>But before long, the phone proved that his guess was correct. The loading completed and the hand symbol turned into an icon that appeared on the phone’s home screen. It was right beside the Ant Nest logo, with the three words: “Ancient Imperial City.”</p>
<p>It’s really become a game dungeon? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he held back his excitement and tapped the Ancient Imperial City icon.</p>
<p>Indeed, the screen displayed the familiar loading screen of the game. After a while, the interface changed into Guide Ancient City’s north gate. Unlike reality, the door to the ancient city was already open.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped a drop of blood on the screen which manifested into the blood-colored avatar that directly walked through the gates.</p>
<p>The sights that welcomed him were ancient stone pavements and antiquated old wooden buildings. Although Zhou Wen had never entered Guide Ancient City, he had seen videos of its interior on the Internet. It was identical to what he was seeing.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could do a comparison, a ragged-clothed skeleton holding a bone club appeared on the streets. It ran straight for the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen this creature before in the videos. It was none other than Guide Ancient City’s dimensional creature, Skeleton Soldier.</p>
<h3 id='chapter17'>Chapter 17: Ancient Imperial City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Skeleton Soldiers were rather weak dimensional creatures. They had slow Speed, medium Strength, and weak Constitution. They had been taught in school how to deal with them. A typical high schooler who wasn’t too terrible at cultivation had no trouble dealing with one or two Skeleton Soldiers.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had never fought with a real Skeleton Soldier before, he could tell that they were much weaker than Vigor Ants. He didn’t know how much Strength or Constitution it had, but its Speed was at a max of 3.</p>
<p>Controlling his blood-colored avatar to rush over, Zhou Wen met the Skeleton Soldier as it struck down with the club but due to its extremely slow speed, it was reduced to scattering bones by the blood-colored avatar before it could even land a hit.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Amidst the pile of broken bones, a dimensional crystal dropped. Upon scrutiny, it was a Skeleton Soldier Crystal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The chance of a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal dropping was very low. To have one drop almost immediately meant he was very lucky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Skeleton Soldier’s Primordial Energy Skill is supposedly Skeleton Palm. It can only boost some Strength and its effect isn’t very strong. Besides, it’s typically a low Rank 1 Primordial Energy Skill. Zhou Wen recalled the information he learned from school and felt somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Getting the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Skeleton Soldier Crystal, caused it to instantly transform into a gray stream that bored into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt a cold aura go from his phone to his palm. Then, it circulated through his body, forming a strange Primordial Energy circulation path.</p>
<p>Obtained Primordial Energy Skill: Skeleton Palm (Rank 1). Expends 1 Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Skeleton Palm expends 1 Primordial Energy per use. It uses much less than Vigor Divine Fist but is much weaker. It should be one of the weakest Primordial Energy Skills. Zhou Wen knew that typically, the stronger the Primordial Energy Skill, the more Primordial Energy it used. Something that only expended 1 Primordial Energy was definitely weak.</p>
<p>Since it wasn’t convenient to test the might of Skeleton Palm, Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar continue walking deeper into Ancient Imperial City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know why Guide Ancient City would be renamed as Ancient Imperial City in-game. Based on what he knew, Guide City was an ancient city with a long history. In ancient times, it had the names of Yingtian and Shangqiu, and its history traced back to the mythical times of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.</p>
<p>Emperor Zhuan Xu of the Five Emperors had once set up his capital here before moving it to Diqiu. The leader of the Three Sovereigns, Suiren was born here. Likewise for Emperor Ku of the Five Emperors and his son, Xie of Shang.</p>
<p>A name like Emperor Ku was probably unfamiliar to the average person, but Emperor Ku was the underlying archetype in which Emperor Dijun was depicted in the classic text of mythic creatures, Classic of Mountains and Seas.</p>
<p>These were all myths and no one knew if they truly existed. However, after the dimensional storms, Guide Ancient City became a dimensional zone, and to date, it hadn’t been fully explored.</p>
<p>A few years ago, powerful humans at the Epic stage stormed deep into Guide Ancient City, never to return. From that moment forth, no one dared to venture deep into it.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades of evolution, the strongest human was only at the half-step Mythical stage. In fact, that only meant the peak Epic stage. The disappearance of such an expert spoke volumes of how terrifying the deep depths of the ancient city were.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the dimensional zones seemed to have powerful restrictions, making it difficult for the dimensional creatures to rush out of the zone’s confines. Otherwise, human society would probably be in pandemonium, and wouldn’t be as calm as it was.</p>
<p>Summoning the Mutated Vigor Ant, he charged deep into Ancient Imperial City with it. From time to time, Skeleton Soldiers would charge up to him only to be easily slain by him and the ant.</p>
<p>However, apart from the first Skeleton Soldier encounter, no other crystals dropped. The drop rates of Skeleton Soldiers were lower than Vigor Ants.</p>
<p>In the game, Zhou Wen tried the might of the Skeleton Palm, and unsurprisingly, it was much weaker than Vigor Divine Fist. It boosted his Strength by about 10–20%, making it significantly weaker than Tian Xiangdong’s Lightning Fist.</p>
<p>However, there was a pro to Skeleton Palm. It had a mildness to it, and the amount of motion required when delivering it was minimized. It was agile and quick, unlike Vigor Divine Fist which required open and exaggerated actions.</p>
<p>Skeleton Palm is more suitable for fusing with Inch Punch. However, Skeleton Palm is too weak. Even if I fuse it, the damage against the Silver-Winged Flying Ant will be limited. As Zhou Wen was in thought, he sensed someone walking towards him.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of students gathering for the combat test. However, Zhou Wen had chosen a corner, so anyone who walked over was highly likely to be looking for him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there weren’t many Skeleton Soldiers, so the Mutated Vigor Ant was more than sufficient to handle them, making it possible for Zhou Wen to divert his attention. He looked up and took a glance.</p>
<p>Believing that it was Li Xuan, Zhou Wen was surprised when he identified the person. It was An Jing who he hadn’t seen since she had defeated him in one move.</p>
<p>An Jing was a girl who didn’t have the modern interpretation of beauty. She didn’t have a sharp chin, double eyelids, or a high nose. She looked more like a classic beauty with a petite nose and a slight chubbiness to her face that wore a sharp, masculine air. She had feline-like eyes and her gaze was firm and forceful.</p>
<p>She was taller than Fang Ruoxi and was almost Zhou Wen’s height. To men, a woman this tall exuded a suppressive feeling. It was especially so with An Jing’s demeanor that automatically warded off strangers. Boys with slightly weaker willpower might not even dare to look her in the eye.</p>
<p>An Jing walked straight to Zhou Wen and, without waiting for him to say a word, she threw a USB drive at him.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Zhou Wen caught it and asked An Jing in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Uncle Feng got me to give this to you.” An Jing glanced at the phone Zhou Wen was holding and said in a seemingly mocking tone, “However, I think Uncle Feng’s painstaking actions were for nothing. Anything, no matter how good it is, is a waste when given to someone who wallows in self-misery.”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could say a word, An Jing turned and walked a few steps before pausing. Without looking back, she said, “In the future, don’t you say that you’re from the An family. Our family does not want such a weakling like you.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Jing walked off without turning back. Once she had left the warning zone, she left in a car with a military license plate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly as the military vehicle left. Only then did he shake his head and mutter, “I’m not from your family to begin with. Neither did I plan on rubbing off some of your family’s glory. Perhaps you guys are overthinking things.”</p>
<p>Placing the USB drive into his pocket, Zhou Wen continued grinding the Ancient Imperial City dungeon and kept killing Skeleton Soldiers.</p>
<p>Even if nothing good dropped, it allowed him to familiarize himself with the environment inside Ancient Imperial City.</p>
<p>Although the school had provided them with the information and a map of the ancient city, the map was only limited to the vicinity around the northern city gate. On the one hand, the map wasn’t complete and on the other hand, it was to prevent the students from venturing too deep into the ancient city for fear of any mishaps.</p>
<h3 id='chapter18'>Chapter 18: Skeleton General</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>If Zhou Wen didn’t have the phone or the game dungeon, he wouldn’t have ventured deep into the ancient city either. It would be risking his life for nothing and there was no need to do so.</p>
<p>But things were different now. He could venture deep into the game dungeon and figure out the situation inside. When he later entered the ancient city, he would naturally be familiar, reducing his risk.</p>
<p>It was quite similar to the information and maps given by the school. The region in the vicinity of the north gates had some Skeleton Soldiers. These Skeleton Soldiers were slightly stronger than adult men who had never cultivated. Against high schoolers who had cultivated, they were only in for a beating. Unless one courted death and charged into a horde of Skeleton Soldiers, it typically wouldn’t be too dangerous.</p>
<p>Without much holding him back, Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar ride on the Mutated Vigor Ant and storm in. Even if he encountered Skeleton Soldiers that formed a group of a dozen or so, the Mutated Vigor Ant was easily able to kill the horde. It wasn’t something Zhou Wen needed the blood-colored avatar to take action on.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen rushed outside of the map given by the school.</p>
<p>The ancient city’s interior was filled with stone-paved streets and ancient buildings. The further he ventured, the more ancient the style of the buildings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only dared to proceed along the streets and avoided the ancient buildings that lined them. In the education curriculum, it had been repeatedly mentioned that it was best that one didn’t enter the buildings of dimensional zones. Many buildings were connected to dimensional rifts, so entry might lead to getting lost in a different dimension.</p>
<p>The drop rate of Skeleton Soldiers was extremely low. He had killed more than two hundred, but other than his first Skeleton Soldier, nothing else had dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised by this. He had previously heard that Skeleton Soldiers seldom condensed dimensional crystals because of their low level.</p>
<p>Although Skeleton Palm was weak, it was really rare to obtain a Skeleton Palm Crystal.</p>
<p>While in thought, he suddenly saw a group of Skeleton Soldiers on the street up ahead. There were about twenty to thirty of them. This was the biggest horde of Skeleton Soldiers he had seen since he had stepped in.</p>
<p>Unlike the Skeleton Soldiers from before, this horde of Skeleton Soldiers was surrounding a skeleton horse. Riding it was a Skeleton General wielding a bone spear.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General on the skeleton horse was clearly taller and stronger than the typical Skeleton Soldier. It was at least one head taller. Furthermore, its skull was especially thick. It wasn’t the ordinary grayish-white color as it had an ivory sheen to it.</p>
<p>The armor he wore was ragged, but he wore a dark red cape over his back. Although it was somewhat old, it was complete.</p>
<p>The bone spear was about two meters long and its surface was rough. Its tip was sharp like a thorn and it was barbed. If one was stabbed by the spear, it would probably lead to incessant bleeding.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw him, the Skeleton General had also seen the blood-colored avatar and Mutated Vigor Ant controlled by Zhou Wen. However, he wasn’t like the typical dimensional creature who immediately charged forward. Instead, he continued riding on his skeleton horse as though he loathed the idea of attacking. It was the horde of Skeleton Soldiers that charged forward like savage tigers and wolves.</p>
<p>The Mutated Vigor Ants front claws sliced like Death’s scythe and in one revolution, cleaved through the Skeleton Soldiers, killing around ten of them.</p>
<p>The fellow on the skeleton horse finally couldn’t put up with it and it roared into the sky, letting out a harsh, terrifying cry before charging forward.</p>
<p>The skeleton horse’s speed wasn’t something the typical Skeleton Soldier could compare with. It even took Zhou Wen by surprise for it was faster than the Mutated Vigor Ant and the blood-colored avatar. It swept over like a tornado in no way slower than the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the skeleton horse landed in front of the Mutated Vigor Ant. Zhou Wen commanded the Mutated Vigor Ant to meet the enemy with its claws, hoping to hold back the bone spear before the blood-colored avatar leaped up to strike at the enemy’s head.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, the bone spear accelerated, turning into a blur in Zhou Wen’s vision as though it had vanished for a moment.</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen could see again, the bone spear had penetrated the Mutated Vigor Ant’s claws, stabbing straight into the blood-colored avatar’s chest.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Blood spewed out as the blood-colored avatar was thrown off the back of the Mutated Vigor Ant. The game screen instantly went black. Clearly, he had died an instant death.</p>
<p>That powerful? Zhou Wen felt a little delighted. Challenges were meant to be met and overcome. Killing the ordinary Skeleton Soldiers was meaningless as they didn’t drop anything fancy.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to restart the game, he saw Li Xuan walking over with two similarly aged youths.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never met them before. They didn’t appear to be students of Guide High School, and there was a high chance that they were like Li Xuan, being a student of Guide High School in name, but had never schooled there.</p>
<p>“When we enter the ancient city, you don’t have to do a thing. Just follow by my side, leave the rest to them.” Li Xuan didn’t introduce Zhou Wen to the two youths. All he did was give a casual warning.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement. Since he could easily pass the combat test, he had no plans on stealing the limelight.</p>
<p>With the two youths having no intention to greet him, Zhou Wen was happy to be free of the small talk. He stood by the side as he continued gaming.</p>
<p>While the two youths discussed the combat test with Li Xuan, they kept assuring him, claiming that with them around, Li Xuan was definitely getting first on the Guide City combat test.</p>
<p>Their tone made it seem as though obtaining first in the Guide City combat test was as easy as drinking water.</p>
<p>“That may be so, but you have to do it well for me. Nothing must go wrong. I have to be first in the Guide City combat test at all cost,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, rest assured. What kind of true experts can there be in a small place like Guide City? Ignoring the fact that I’ll be joining forces with Jiang Hao, just me alone would be able to guarantee that you get first,” Xu Miantu said without any concern.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan frown slightly, Jiang Hao hurriedly said, “Brother Xuan, rest assured. We will do our best. We guarantee you that nothing will go wrong.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Only then did Li Xuan nod slightly.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu was still about to say something when he saw someone walking over.</p>
<p>The four turned their heads over. It was a tall beauty who easily lit up the eyes of others.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, it’s great that you can find a team,” Fang Ruoxi came in front of Zhou Wen as she said in relief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled and said, “That’s all thanks to Li Xuan. I’m able to join the combat test thanks to him.”</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi didn’t know Li Xuan, nor did she know Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao. However, she felt a weight lift off her chest that Zhou Wen was able to participate. She said with a smile, “I thought I could still try my luck at first, but with you around, I guess first is impossible.”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu wasn’t too happy when he heard that. Fang Ruoxi’s words sounded as though them teaming up with Zhou Wen was them taking advantage of him.</p>
<p>“Babe, with Zhou Wen joining us, you can be at ease. Although he has no hopes of getting into the top three, it’s still easy to guarantee that he gets fourth thanks to the team,” Xu Miantu said to Fang Ruoxi with a grin.</p>
<h3 id='chapter19'>Chapter 19: Entering the Ancient City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Fang Ruoxi glanced at Xu Miantu before ignoring him. She continued looking at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou Wen, what school do you plan on attending?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t thought about it yet,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi nodded and said, “That’s right. With how capable you are, you can attend any school you wish. There’s no rush. That’s good too. I’ll try my best to complete this test. I hope my results aren’t too far from yours.”</p>
<p>With that said, Fang Ruoxi waved her hand at Zhou Wen, turned around and left. From beginning to end, she had ignored Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu was displeased with this treatment, but it wasn’t the right place to flare up. All he did was shoot a glance at Zhou Wen and said to Jiang Hao and Li Xuan, “People from small cities really have limited horizons. What a waste of her good looks, too bad she lacks brains and eyes.”</p>
<p>Jiang Hao didn’t say a word, but Li Xuan’s interest in Zhou Wen was slightly piqued. He asked Zhou Wen, “I heard that you were once Guide High School’s number one genius. From the looks of it, that’s true. That chick seems to hold you in high regard.”</p>
<p>“It’s just encouragement between fellow students. She’s excellent herself and no way weaker than me. Placed anywhere, she will be one of a handful of cultivation geniuses,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was rebutting him. He said in disdain, “If you were really excellent, why would you need us to carry you?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan hadn’t informed Xu Miantu and company about Zhou Wen. All he had said was that he was helping a friend to take a student along with them for the participation of the combat test.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t defend himself, finding an argument with Xu Miantu beneath him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan cut off Xu Miantu who still hadn’t said his piece. “Enough, cut it out. It’s about time we enter. All of you are to focus.”</p>
<p>With Li Xuan saying so, all Xu Miantu could do was swallow the words he was about to say. He gave Zhou Wen a pissed look.</p>
<p>The examiners were already verifying the students’ candidacies. With four people a team, they each brought their candidature passes to a verification machine. They gathered their fingerprints, scanned their passes, and checked the items on them. Only when they were confirmed to be the candidate in question and that they hadn’t brought any item that aided in cheating, were they allowed entry into the ancient city.</p>
<p>Most of the students weren’t nervous. Instead, it was the family who came with them who were almost fainting while standing beyond the warning line. They watched helplessly as the students entered the ancient city, some almost having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and his team lined up to go through the inspection, passing through a secured passage, before arriving in front of the ancient city.</p>
<p>The gates to the ancient city had already opened, but everything inside seemed to be a blurry mist. There was no way to discern the interior.</p>
<p>Guarding the ancient city’s gates, the soldiers who were armed to the teeth urged, “Stop looking and enter quickly. There are plenty of people lining up behind you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Li Xuan and company to walk towards the ancient city’s gates. With the trio walking into the ancient city, he followed closely behind them. However, when they passed through the gates, he realized he couldn’t see them.</p>
<p>He hurriedly walked through the blurry gates and felt a strange giddiness overwhelm him as he got goosebumps all over him.</p>
<p>But with just one step, the scene before Zhou Wen’s eyes opened up. The mist inside the ancient city was gone. He could clearly see the stone-paved streets and ancient buildings with blue tiles and red walls lining the streets. Li Xuan and the other two were right in front, just a few steps away from him.</p>
<p>Those scientists have theorized that the dimensional zones are equivalent to another spatial dimension. It does seem to make sense from the looks of it.</p>
<p>After most students had entered, they curiously sized up the ancient city just like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although they had watched some of the footage inside Guide Ancient City from the school’s video material, to truly step in here gave them a different feeling. The antiquity and feeling that seemed to span the entire gamut of human experiences were things that video footage couldn’t capture.</p>
<p>The examiner gathered the batch of candidates and mentioned a few key things to take note of. When that was done, the combat test officially began.</p>
<p>All the students who participated in the test rushed for the ancient city’s streets and alleys, hoping to kill the most number of Skeleton Soldiers to obtain a better result.</p>
<p>Of course, there were people who had the hope that a few dimensional crystals would drop during the test. That would make things even better.</p>
<p>The Earth League had made it clear that any dimensional crystals that dropped during the combat test were the property of the students themselves.</p>
<p>However, the examiner had also made it clear that the student was to be responsible for whatever happened during the test.</p>
<p>According to the League’s laws, after reaching the age of sixteen, one could freely choose to take the combat test. The responsibility was theirs to undertake. Even if death was to occur, the League wouldn’t provide a single cent of compensation.</p>
<p>Compared to the other subjects in the college entrance exams, only a few hundred students from the city actually participated in the combat test. Inside the transformed ancient city, they appeared inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan headed deep into the ancient city. In the beginning, there were plenty of students, so the Skeleton Soldiers that appeared weren’t enough for them to kill. Li Xuan and company didn’t intend to snatch the mobs with the other students, so they circled around the battlefields and ventured deep into the ancient city.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao took point and every Skeleton Soldier they encountered was taken down with one strike. Mobs of Skeleton Soldiers were nothing worth mentioning due to the huge disparity in strength.</p>
<p>Amidst the skeleton of the Skeleton Soldiers, there was a bone the size of a rice grain. Each Skeleton Soldier only had one of those, and one’s score in the combat test was determined by the number of bones that had been gathered.</p>
<p>However, the number of bones could only determine a team’s ranking. The ranking within the team was determined by the number of dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the direction the quartet was heading in happened to be the one Zhou Wen had attempted while in-game. As they stormed their way through the ancient city, all the scenery was identical to the one in-game.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only the ancient buildings in the ancient city. Even the number of Skeleton Soldiers that appeared was identical to the game.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we will be meeting that fellow on the skeleton horse? However, Zhou Wen quickly had another idea. That area had exceeded the confines of the test, so it was unlikely Li Xuan and company would risk entering.</p>
<p>But things exceeded his expectations. Xu Miantu and company stormed their way through without stopping when they reached the boundary of the test. They went straight out of the test’s boundaries.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, we have already left the test boundaries. Should we be heading back?” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Before Li Xuan said a word, Xu Miantu said in contempt, “The area of the test is so tiny. The number of Skeleton Soldiers is extremely limited. Even if we could get all of them, how many can we get? If you’re afraid, just wait here until we return. There’s no need for you to follow us in.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan also said with a smile. “Don’t worry. We have the complete information of Guide Ancient City. All we will encounter for the next ten to fifteen kilometers are Skeleton Soldiers. There won’t be any Legendary stage dimensional creatures appearing. The test’s area is rather conservative because they do not wish for students to get into accidents. Just as Miantu said, with that small number of Skeleton Soldiers in the test area, it’s not enough for us to get a high score. It’s almost necessary that we continue forward.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter20'>Chapter 20: Persuasion</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Upon seeing the trio’s expression, Zhou Wen knew that his persuasion was completely useless.</p>
<p>He did have the intention to stay behind, ignoring whatever the trio might encounter. However, his results would be severely impacted if they were to die inside. He might even be removed from the list of candidates from the top schools.</p>
<p>Also, Yu Qiubai had introduced him, so he had the responsibility to help Li Xuan attain good results. Although Li Xuan didn’t think so, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see Li Xuan sending himself to his death. That would affect Yu Qiubai’s reputation and it was highly likely that the Li family would blame it on Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>Let’s hope they don’t venture too deep. As long as they don’t approach the area where the Skeleton General is, there shouldn’t be much of a problem. Zhou Wen thought without saying another word as he followed Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen silent, Xu Miantu imagined that it was because Zhou Wen didn’t dare be alone. He scoffed in contempt. “When one’s a burden, one should realize that. Just follow us obediently and cut the nonsense.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the interest or time to bother with him. Taking out his phone, he secretly dripped a drop of blood before entering the Ancient Imperial City game dungeon.</p>
<p>He wanted to venture ahead to test the Skeleton General’s strength. It was best if he could find a way to kill him, and even if he failed, he could at least find a way to ensure his survival in front of him.</p>
<p>After all, Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu were taking point, killing all the Skeleton Soldiers that rushed at them. There was nothing Zhou Wen needed to do.</p>
<p>The danger was nonexistent. Even if a Skeleton Soldier were to rush at him, he could easily finish it off with his present strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept walking behind, unafraid that they would see his screen since they were unlikely to recognize it.</p>
<p>The game interface followed a cartoon style, making it very disparate from real life. The typical person wouldn’t make the connection.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was like Zhou Wen; he had nothing to do. When he saw Zhou Wen taking out his phone to game in such an area, he quipped, “You are really a gaming addict. You still feel like gaming in here?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I have anything else to do, so I’m just playing games to kill time,” Zhou Wen replied without looking up. His eyes were peeled to the screen as he controlled the blood-colored avatar, blazing a trail while riding the Mutated Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>The ordinary Skeleton Soldiers were unable to block the Mutated Vigor Ant at all. Their bodies scattered from the impact and they weren’t as fast as it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also couldn’t be bothered to kill them. All he wanted was to rush to the spot where the Skeleton General was.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I shall game as well,” Li Xuan said as he took out his phone. He tapped on the screen; the game he played a mystery.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s gaming could be ignored, but Zhou Wen was also playing. This pissed off Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>“What the hell? Is this the number one genius of Guide High School? He’s like a gaming nerd,” Xu Miantu cursed under his breath in great displeasure.</p>
<p>Although Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao were powerful, they were still made up of flesh and blood. They were still susceptible to fatigue and injury; therefore, when they encountered relatively large hordes of Skeleton Soldiers, they had to be very careful. This slowed down the speed of their advancement.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he was charging the entire way in-game. His rate of progress was far faster than their progress in real life. In just half an hour, he arrived at the spot where he had met the skeleton horse-riding Skeleton General.</p>
<p>Like the last time, that fellow immediately charged when it saw the blood-colored avatar and Mutated Vigor Ant. Its speed was terrifying, in no way something Zhou Wen and the Mutated Vigor Ant could compare with.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was fully focused. He was thinking of ways to deal with the spear attacks, but when he saw the bone spear thrusting at him, he failed to dodge it. He didn’t have the opportunity to extend his hand to block the attack before being penetrated in the chest.</p>
<p>That was fast. This spear attack must be some type of Primordial Energy Skill. Zhou Wen could already confirm that the spear attack was a Primordial Energy Skill; otherwise, it was impossible that he had failed to even react.</p>
<p>A speed-type Primordial Energy Skill? This fellow is more difficult than the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, that Silver-Winged Flying Ant apparently never used Primordial Energy Skills. As Zhou Wen pondered over the matter, he revived the blood-colored avatar, rode the Mutated Vigor Ant, and charged into the depths of Ancient Imperial City.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen rushed over, he carefully recalled the details of his previous two deaths. He hoped to find a strategy to deal with the Skeleton General by studying the details.</p>
<p>By doing so, he came up with a few possibilities. However, their viability needed him to test them out to know if they worked.</p>
<p>When he saw the Skeleton General charge at him again, Zhou Wen deliberately dodged the skeleton horse’s direct charge. He wanted to know if the Primordial Energy Skill was only capable of a frontal thrust.</p>
<p>The facts proved that he was wrong. When the blood-colored avatar dodged to the side of the skeleton horse under Zhou Wen’s control, the bone spear tip swept a crescent arc like a stream of light, instantly decapitating the blood-colored avatar’s head. It was no doubt an instant kill.</p>
<p>Making mistakes wasn’t a terrifying problem. What was terrifying was the lack of opportunity to amend strategies. However, the mysterious phone was what gave Zhou Wen this opportunity for amendments.</p>
<p>His Primordial Energy Skill is not only a thrust, but it’s also capable of side cleaving. This makes it difficult. Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged; instead, he secretly dripped another drop of blood on the phone’s screen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of his severe loss of blood in the past month or so, Zhou Wen felt a little giddy.</p>
<p>I need to think of means to replenish my blood in the future. If this continues, I might really end up dying from anemia. Zhou Wen felt a slight headache, but he couldn’t think of a good solution.</p>
<p>With the first experiment failing, all Zhou Wen could do was switch methods. Thankfully, he was only making attempts in-game. If it happened in real life, there was no way he would do something beyond his means. After all, he only had one life. He couldn’t just bet on it.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen made his attempts, Xu Miantu and company were continuing their push forward.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures in the dimensional zone were nearly endless. As the zone was connected to dimensional rifts, even if the creatures were wiped out, the area would be occupied again by new creatures. There was no way of killing them all.</p>
<p>However, the dimensional rifts weren’t stable. Pan-dimensional creatures didn’t appear at random, so after clearing an area, there wouldn’t be any Skeleton Soldiers appearing for a short period of time. Xu Miantu and company’s advancement was still pretty good.</p>
<p>The chances of Skeleton Soldiers producing dimensional crystals were quite small, with one Strength Crystal being dug out from the Skeleton Soldiers’ bodies every two to three hundred Skeleton Soldiers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t a game. They could only roughly identify the Strength Crystals, but had no idea what their values were.</p>
<p>The Strength Crystal was naturally Li Xuan’s. In fact, as long as he had one, he would be first in the team.</p>
<p>“We’ve already hunted enough Skeleton Soldiers. We are very far from the determined region of the test. We need to rush back before the end. Can we not continue proceeding forward?” Upon noticing that they were approaching the Skeleton General’s region, Zhou Wen said once again to Li Xuan.</p>
<h3 id='chapter21'>Chapter 21: Unexpected Development</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Before Li Xuan could say a word, Xu Miantu said, “It’s still early, and the number of bone beads we have isn’t enough to guarantee us first place. We naturally need to proceed forward.”</p>
<p>Jiang Hao also looked at the map and said, “Based on the map, this area is still the safe zone. We can proceed another ten kilometers without encountering much danger.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan opened up the map on his phone and nodded after taking a look. “Based on the information, there aren’t any Legendary stage creatures in the vicinity. It should be ok if we proceed forward a little. We need to obtain enough bone beads to be the bona fide winners of Guide City. We cannot afford otherwise.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he needed to dissuade Li Xuan and company from proceeding forward; otherwise, the death of any one of them when they encountered the Skeleton General would drastically affect his results.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t have any plans to enter high society via the university he attended, he still wished to enroll in a reputable university.</p>
<p>If any of the four of them died, the chances of entering a top reputable university became extremely slim. No matter how well he did in his other subjects, he would only be able to enroll in a first-rate university. That wasn’t something Zhou Wen wanted.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, do you believe in the sixth sense?” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“What are you getting at?” Li Xuan didn’t directly answer as he asked with piqued interest.</p>
<p>“I find my sixth sense better than most people. Since I was little, I would have a vague feeling just before encountering danger. This feeling leaves me very uncomfortable. Although I’m not sure if it’s a premonition for danger, I usually encounter trouble soon after.” Zhou Wen continued, “And I just had a very uncomfortable feeling.”</p>
<p>“Just admit to being afraid. Why use sixth sense as an excuse?” Xu Miantu spoke with contempt.</p>
<p>Li Xuan sized up Zhou Wen for a moment before casting his gaze at Jiang Hao.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao thought and then said, “The bone beads we have at present can’t guarantee us first place. It might be a little inappropriate if we were to head back now.”</p>
<p>Clearly, Jiang Hao was supportive of continuing forward.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan somewhat persuaded, Zhou Wen hurriedly said, “Li Xuan, please trust me. Although this feeling of mine doesn’t happen every time danger rears its head, great trouble is certain once I have this feeling. If I’m just a coward, I could have just retreated to the entrance and waited for you guys. There isn’t a need for me to tell you this.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Zhou Wen continued, “Just as Xu Miantu said, Guide City is a small city. There aren’t many high schoolers who are that strong. I doubt many high schoolers will dare to venture past the designated zone to kill Skeleton Soldiers. We have already obtained a sizable number of bone beads and can always return to the designated zone to kill more. First place is practically guaranteed without taking any risks. After all, we only have one life. There’s no harm in being cautious.”</p>
<p>“What you say makes sense.” Li Xuan seemed to be moved by Zhou Wen’s words as he nodded. “Let’s do this then. We shall head back before heading elsewhere to hunt Skeleton Soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Come on, there’s no need for that.” Xu Miantu grumbled but didn’t dare disobey Li Xuan’s decision. He turned around and headed back with the team.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao also followed and walked by Li Xuan’s side.</p>
<p>Obviously, Zhou Wen had already turned around to head back, but after taking two steps, he suddenly heard Jiang Hao exclaim. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>He gave everyone a shock as they turned to look. They found him looking at an ancient building with a bewildered look as though he had seen something most terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Xu Miantu subconsciously turned their heads to look when a glint flashed in Jiang Hao’s hands. A strange jade dagger appeared in each of his hands.</p>
<p>The jade dagger in Jiang Hao’s left hand struck like a venomous snake’s tongue, instantly stabbing Li Xuan. The foot-long blade plunged into his waist completely.</p>
<p>This sudden development happened so abruptly that Xu Miantu didn’t even realize what was happening when the other jade dagger in Jiang Hao’s right hand swiped at his neck.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu had retreated quickly but had failed to avoid being injured. Although none of his arteries were severed, his neck was instantly dyed red with blood.</p>
<p>“Jiang Hao… What are you doing…” Xu Miantu wore a look of alarm as he covered the wound on his neck, shouting as he retreated. He was filled with disbelief over what had just happened.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao ignored Xu Miantu as he clenched the pair of jade daggers with both hands, staring intently at the wound on Li Xuan’s waist.</p>
<p>He was responsible for the wound and he knew what kind of effect such a wound would have; however, the flesh and fat at the wound seemed to possess a certain force that exerted pressure on the wound. The tiny amount of blood that had seeped out was nearly impossible for a wound this deep.</p>
<p>“I never expected that the promiscuous third scion of the Li family would have mastered something that would require being a virgin—the Invincible Connate Divine Art,” Jiang Hao said slowly as he glared at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was similarly alarmed when he heard “Invincible Connate Divine Art.”</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skills and Companion Beasts could be obtained by hunting dimensional creatures, but Primordial Energy Arts weren’t things that could be obtained by dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Primordial Energy Arts stemmed from ancient arts like Chinese qigong , battle qi , or Japanese ninjutsu . However, due to the lack of Primordial Energy Crystals in the past, those arts lacked the support of Primordial Energy, preventing them from expressing their true might.</p>
<p>It was only when the dimensional creatures appeared, allowing humans to absorb dimensional crystals, that these arts grew in use, gradually developing into present-day Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Arts had significant effects on humans. Absorbing dimensional crystals allowed humans to grow stronger and evolve, but this wasn’t sufficient at advancing between stages. Instead, it was Primordial Energy Arts that possessed the power to allow a breakthrough of such restrictions.</p>
<p>For instance, if Zhou Wen wanted to advance from the Mortal stage to the Legendary stage, simply absorbing dimensional crystals would be insufficient. He would need to advance Ascetic Meditation to a whole new realm before his body would evolve to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Energy Arts had their differences. Ascetic Meditation could, at best, advance Zhou Wen to the Legendary stage—the maximum it could go. It was unable to advance Zhou Wen to the Epic stage no matter how much more he cultivated in it.</p>
<p>Among the known Primordial Energy Arts, there were fewer than twenty that allowed humans to advance to the Epic stage. Invincible Connate Divine Art was one of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Invincible Connate Divine Art had a strange cultivation requirement. It required the cultivator to be a virgin.</p>
<p>Once one was no longer a virgin, the Invincible Connate Divine Art would become ineffective, losing all of its original might.</p>
<h3 id='chapter22'>Chapter 22: Legendary Companion Beast</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Due to the strange cultivation requirement, the Invincible Connate Divine Art was also known as a Virgin Divine Art. It was the least cultivated among all the Epic stage-capable Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Firstly, Invincible Connate Divine Art could only be cultivated by men. Women who took up slightly more than half of the human population were incapable of cultivating it. Furthermore, with the requirement of being a virgin, even fewer people cultivated in it.</p>
<p>No matter how potent the Invincible Connate Divine Art was, to become useless the moment one lost their virginity was a fatal flaw.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical person didn’t have the chance to acquire it, so they had no chance of cultivating it even if they wished to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wouldn’t be too surprised if someone else had cultivated in it, but Li Xuan was a man who found himself swimming amongst women daily. Therefore, it was truly unbelievable that he had managed to master the Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t look at the wound on his waist. In fact, due to the compression and suppression of his muscles, the wound had basically stopped bleeding.</p>
<p>“Did my second brother send you?” Li Xuan glared at Jiang Hao as he asked. He didn’t wear the blank, ignorant look that Xu Miantu wore.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao nodded and said, “I originally thought that it wasn’t necessary for him to take such actions, but from the look of it, your second brother has quite a discerning eye. For you to maintain your virginity, despite swimming in pussy daily, you are truly an incredible genius. You will definitely be a thorn in his side.”</p>
<p>“Jiang Hao, are you mad? You are actually helping Li Mobai kill Brother Xuan? Do you not know that if Brother Xuan dies here, there will be no way we can answer to Godfather. Don’t forget how much we owe Godfather for his kindness. He also dotes on Brother Xuan the most, so how can you bear to make him sad?” Xu Miantu said as he held his wound.</p>
<p>His injury was a lot lighter than Li Xuan’s, but unfortunately, he hadn’t cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art. The blood that he had lost was enough to make his head spin.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao ignored Xu Miantu as he gripped his dangers tightly, staring intently at Li Xuan like a ravenous wolf.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu still wasn’t done when he was interrupted by Li Xuan. Li Xuan looked at Jiang Hao and said, “I’ve never fought Brother for anything since I was little. To prevent him from second-guessing me, I spent all my time with women and never paid attention to any Li family matters. Yet, he still is unwilling to let me off.”</p>
<p>“Two tigers cannot share one mountain. A family can’t have two heads. If there’s anything to blame, it’s that you only acted like a pig instead of being a real one. Otherwise, none of this would be necessary,” Jiang Hao said.</p>
<p>“Jiang Hao, do you really believe you can kill me?” Li Xuan said coldly.</p>
<p>“By telling you this much, it shows how determined I am to kill you. Your mastering of the Invincible Connate Divine Art has indeed exceeded my expectations, but unfortunately, you are only at the Mortal stage and have yet to advance to the Legendary stage. Your death is a certainty today,” As Jiang Hao spoke, he tore off his left sleeve, revealing his entire left arm.</p>
<p>There was a spiraling blue-green tattoo that nearly covered Jiang Hao’s entire left arm—a coiled snake.</p>
<p>The snake tattoo was shimmering with a demonic green-blue glow as though it was alive. Green-blue scales surfaced and enveloped Jiang Hao’s entire left arm and hand, making his arm appear like a bizarre venomous snake exuding extremely uncanny vibes.</p>
<p>“Explosive Scaled Snake, a Legendary stage Companion Beast… Impossible… You are only at the Mortal stage… How could you incubate a Legendary stage Companion Beast? Don’t tell me that you have already advanced to the Legendary stage? To reach the Legendary stage at sixteen… That’s impossible…” Xu Miantu stared at Jiang Hao’s left arm as he exclaimed, a look of horror plastering his face.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao shook his head slightly. “I haven’t advanced to the Legendary stage. I’m just capable of using the Explosive Scaled Snake.”</p>
<p>“How is it possible to incubate one without advancing to the Legendary stage? The Primordial Energy needed by an Explosive Scaled Snake is enough to suck dry anyone at the Mortal stage. It’s impossible to incubate one…” Xu Miantu still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Li Xuan harrumphed and said, “Brother sure went for broke in order to kill me. There’s only one way to possess a Legendary stage Companion Beast at the Mortal stage without incubating it yourself—it’s to let a Legendary stage expert with a Legendary stage Companion Beast transfer it to the person at the Mortal stage, even at the cost of their lives, ”</p>
<p>“You are indeed smart. Unfortunately, you will have to die today.” Jiang Hao no longer hesitated as he rushed towards Li Xuan. Meanwhile, his arm that resembled a snake slashed down with the jade dagger.</p>
<p>He was exceedingly fast as his snake-like arm seemed to phase away. It was almost impossible for one to use the naked eye to capture its trajectory. As an uncanny green-blue stream of light, it flashed across Li Xuan’s neck.</p>
<p>It was at a speed so fast that it even exceeded the Skeleton General’s spear attack. It gave Zhou Wen the impression that Li Xuan was doomed.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, he heard a clang. Li Xuan had gripped the lightning-fast jade dagger, holding it right in front of him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s hand holding the dagger, or perhaps it should be said that most of his body, was enveloped by black iron armor.</p>
<p>“Black Knight, a Legendary stage Companion Beast. So you have also used the same method to obtain a Legendary stage Companion Beast at the Mortal stage. It’s no wonder you held no fear.” Jiang Hao instantly recognized what the black iron armor on the Legendary stage represented.</p>
<p>“No, you are wrong. I don’t have to use such a cruel method to obtain a Legendary Companion Beast. Nor do I have such a need to.” Li Xuan exerted strength, immediately snapping the dagger in his hand and leaving Jiang Hao to retreat rapidly with the remnants of the jade dagger.</p>
<p>“The Invincible Connate Divine Art is the Primordial Energy Art that has the most amount of Primordial Energy amongst its peers. Even though I’m only at the Mortal stage, I still have the chance of incubating a Legendary stage Companion Beast despite them being the weaker ones and me needing to take on some risk. However, it’s more than sufficient when dealing with your Explosive Scaled Snake.” Li Xuan had a sharp glint in his eyes as he approached Jiang Hao.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder Second Brother views you as a threat. Such talent is indeed terrifying,” Jiang Hao said as he retreated. After saying that, he turned around and ran deep into the Ancient City.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t hesitate as he immediately pursued him.</p>
<p>“Don’t chase after him!” Zhou Wen hurriedly yelled to stop Li Xuan when he saw Jiang Hao fleeing in the direction of the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan was bent on killing Jiang Hao. There was no hesitation in his huge strides.</p>
<p>The two probably had Speed valued at 8 or 9, making it too late for Zhou Wen to catch up with them. Soon, they vanished around a corner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slowed down his pace without continuing his pursuit. Instead, it was Xu Miantu who handled the wound on his neck before chasing after them.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Why aren’t you chasing after them to help Brother Xuan?” Xu Miantu yelled at him when he saw Zhou Wen stop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his phone and launched the Ancient Imperial City dungeon as he said to Xu Miantu, “After you.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter23'>Chapter 23: You Have Two Minutes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Coward,” Xu Miantu cursed under his breath before ignoring Zhou Wen. He immediately continued his pursuit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind really. He wished to help Li Xuan, but heading over was of zero use.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao and Li Xuan had Legendary Companion Beasts, while he had none. Death was a certainty for him when facing the Skeleton General. It was probably more beneficial for him to find the means of dealing with the Skeleton General in-game.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen wanted to help Li Xuan was that deep down he knew that Jiang Hao would silence him and Xu Miantu after he had successfully killed Li Xuan to ensure his own safety.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao’s attack on Xu Miantu had already revealed this thought of his. If Li Xuan was successfully killed, there was no way he would spare Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen was inevitably helping himself by helping Li Xuan.</p>
<p>However, any help he rendered was useless. The might of a Legendary Companion Beast was not something he could equal at present. Be it against Jiang Hao or the Skeleton General, the chances of him being killed was extremely high.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen proceeded forward slowly, he controlled the blood-colored avatar and stormed deep into Ancient Imperial City.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what kind of developments might happen after Li Xuan and Jiang Hao encountered the Skeleton General; therefore, he needed some preparation.</p>
<p>Before encountering the Skeleton General with his blood-colored avatar in-game, he heard a blood-curdling roar coming from deep within the ancient city. “Pledge my life to defend the city… Pledge my life to defend the city…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. This voice was clearly not from Jiang Hao or Li Xuan. However, he had not heard the Skeleton General speak while gaming.</p>
<p>With a mere thought, Zhou Wen had composed himself as he continued focusing on his game.</p>
<p>His surroundings were unable to influence his line of thought. Soon, the blood-colored avatar found the Skeleton General in-game and after repeated failed attempts, Zhou Wen had a general understanding of the Skeleton General’s strength and Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>He knew very well that his strength was insufficient to resist the Skeleton General, especially when it came to Speed. The difference was too disparate, making it difficult for him to even dodge.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General is stronger than me in every aspect. There’s a high chance that he’s a dimensional creature at the Legendary stage. It’s definitely impossible for me to fend him off. However, he’s not without flaws. His bone spear is too long, making it unconducive for him to fight in close-range. Furthermore, the skeleton horse he’s sitting on would affect his attack trajectory beneath the waist. This results in an offensive blind spot… Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and approached the Skeleton General once again, trying to put theory into practice.</p>
<p>When the Skeleton General charged over, Zhou Wen advanced instead of retreating with the blood-colored avatar. With a forward roll, he rushed under the skeleton horse’s belly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grasped the opportunity perfectly. Despite the Skeleton General having the Strength and Speed, he was unable to attack due to the skeleton horse’s obstruction.</p>
<p>After the Skeleton General raised his spear and stabbed downwards again, Zhou Wen had already rolled over to the other side of the skeleton horse’s underside.</p>
<p>The skeleton horse was not part of the Skeleton General, making it difficult for them to act perfectly as one. This gave Zhou Wen a slim chance of survival and several possibilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Skeleton General was just too strong. Zhou Wen had to constantly circle around the skeleton horse to avoid being stabbed by the bone spear. He had no means to launch a counterattack.</p>
<p>Even so, this lasted less than thirty seconds before the blood-colored avatar was stabbed by the Skeleton General on the ground. Blood immediately splattered as the avatar died on the spot.</p>
<p>As he watched the screen go black, Zhou Wen carefully recalled the battle.</p>
<p>He soon heard shouts and clashing sounds. Going around a bend, he immediately saw Li Xuan and Jiang Hao fighting each other on the other end of a stone-paved street.</p>
<p>And in real life, the Skeleton General was around as well. He wore a cape and the skeleton horse he sat on was tall and mighty, its body akin to jade. The bone spear had terrifying barbs and there were blood-colored flames flickering in the skull’s eye sockets. He looked formidable.</p>
<p>This was a completely different existence to the comic-version of the Skeleton General in-game. Zhou Wen nearly failed to recognize him.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen even more intrigued was that the Skeleton General was charging everywhere with the skeleton horse, but his target was ultimately fixated on Li Xuan. He ignored Jiang Hao, never attacking him even once.</p>
<p>Odd. Why would the Skeleton General only be attacking Li Xuan? Seeing the miserable Li Xuan, who kept retreating with his body covered in injuries, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen’s gaze carefully observed Jiang Hao, he immediately came to a realization.</p>
<p>On Jiang Hao, there was an additional bone breastplate. The grayish-white ribs penetrated out of his clothes, protecting his chest and back, making him look odd.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the reason the Skeleton General isn’t attacking Jiang Hao stems from the bone armor he’s wearing. Zhou Wen knew that it was likely a manifestation of a Companion Beast, but the type was unknown to him.</p>
<p>Although Xu Miantu had a nasty tongue, he didn’t seem to have a bad character. He rushed over to help Li Xuan when he found the latter in trouble.</p>
<p>But the outcome was nothing surprising. Upon clashing, he was sent flying by the Skeleton General, tumbling far away across the street and stopping only when he hit a wall.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu bent his back like a shrimp, his hands clasping his abdomen. His mouth was filled with blood and there was cold sweat covering his forehead. The grimace he wore spoke volumes of the pain.</p>
<p>“Be patient. Once I kill Li Xuan, I’ll send you off to hell,” Jiang Hao said coldly, as the dagger in his hand stabbed at Li Xuan’s vital spot.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was fighting two adversaries alone, and he wasn’t even at the Legendary stage. By relying solely on the Legendary Black Knight Companion Beast, it was taxing on him to hold out in battle. The black armor that encased him was damaged in multiple places and blood seeped through.</p>
<p>However, he was a tenacious person. Despite such a perilous situation, he was still able to maintain clarity in thought and avoided most of the lethal strikes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he just wasn’t a Legendary stage expert. He was already a stage lower than the Skeleton General and with Jiang Hao taking opportunistic jabs at him, every second placed him in extreme peril. If not for the potent defensive capabilities of his Black Knight armor and the Invincible Connate Divine Art’s ability to slow down the deterioration of his injuries, he would have long been killed.</p>
<p>After watching for a moment, Zhou Wen suddenly shouted at Li Xuan, “Li Xuan, if I can help you distract the Skeleton General, how long will it take for you to finish off Jiang Hao?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s words shocked the trio. In this battle, it was no longer something that a person at the Mortal stage could interfere in, much less that of a regular high-schooler.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu imagined that Zhou Wen was mad, but unfortunately, he didn’t have the energy to say a word. Otherwise, he would definitely have ridiculed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao didn’t share the same thoughts, he didn’t believe Zhou Wen was capable of the proclaimed feat. He believed that Zhou Wen would be sending himself to his death if he really rushed over to help Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Two minutes. I need that much time,” Li Xuan said as he fought for his life. There was no hesitation in his voice.</p>
<p>“Alright. Then, I’ll give you two minutes.” Zhou Wen put away his phone and headed for the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id='chapter24'>Chapter 24: Who the Hell is He</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen picked up his pace and entered the battlefield in a most ingenious manner, appearing behind the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General keenly noticed Zhou Wen’s appearance and gave up attacking Li Xuan. It struck backward, transforming the bone spear into a cold beam that stabbed at Zhou Wen’s head.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the Skeleton General to raise his spear, Zhou Wen crouched down and lunged for the underside of the skeleton horse. This prevented the bone spear from locking onto him; thus, resolving the Skeleton General’s thrust.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu struggled to his feet as he looked at Zhou Wen with a look of disbelief. Zhou Wen had actually managed to hold back the Skeleton General!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen oscillated between the skeleton horse’s sides, occasionally tumbling to the ground. It looked extremely pathetic, but his actions worked.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu knew how difficult it was. He had the same idea as Zhou Wen earlier, hoping to hold back the Skeleton General to give Li Xuan time to finish off Jiang Hao.</p>
<p>However, he had been swept away the moment he approached the Skeleton General and nearly died from severe injuries. It made him deeply realize the huge differences between the Mortal stage and the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was likewise at the Mortal stage, but he had managed to hold back the Skeleton General. It might look pathetic, but he remained unharmed the entire time. It left Xu Miantu amazed.</p>
<p>Thinking back to his mockery of Zhou Wen, his originally pale face blushed an abnormal red.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao was alarmed to see Zhou Wen hold back the Skeleton General. Despite all his plans, he had never expected a Mortal stage high-schooler to be capable of holding back a Legendary Skeleton General.</p>
<p>In fact, Jiang Hao long knew of the existence of the Skeleton General in the vicinity. He had planned on taking Li Xuan nearby and letting the Skeleton General finish him off.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this plan had been foiled by Zhou Wen. Jiang Hao had no choice but to take action himself, but he ultimately failed.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was holding back the Skeleton General, Li Xuan had already rushed towards Jiang Hao. He unleashed a barrage of punches that shimmered like shooting stars at him.</p>
<p>He knew that it wasn’t pragmatic to expect a Mortal stage hold back the Skeleton General for extended periods of time. He had to finish off Jiang Hao before Zhou Wen was killed by the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>Jiang Hao now truly realized how terrifying this intemperate scion, Li Xuan, was. Despite using similar Legendary Companion Beasts—even with him having two—he was still completely overpowered by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe I can’t last two minutes. We are both at the Mortal stage and are using Legendary Companion Beasts!” Jiang Hao battled Li Xuan with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>In less than twenty seconds, Jiang Hao was hit on the left elbow by Li Xuan, snapping the bone armor in two.</p>
<p>The color in Jiang Hao’s face drained as he rapidly retreated. However, upon seeing Li Xuan pursue him like a leech, his eyes flashed with a ruthless glint. With a swing of his left arm, the Explosive Scaled Snake tattoo shimmered as a brightly-colored blue-green venomous snake tore out from his arm, coiling towards the pursuing Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Seizing this opportunity, Jiang Hao pushed his speed to the limit, allowing him to traverse four to five meters. He was attacking Zhou Wen from behind with a dagger!</p>
<p>“Ah!” This sudden development caused Xu Miantu to cry out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already in a perilous situation while holding back the Skeleton General. Now, with Jiang Hao sneaking an attack on him, death seemed inevitable for him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was alarmed and furious as well. However, with the Explosive Scaled Snake blocking him, he didn’t have the time to rescue Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>While the bone spear thrust around at lightning speed, a dagger stabbed at Zhou Wen’s waist from the back. At this critical moment, Zhou Wen exerted strength into his legs, allowing him to do a sharp turn. A powerful twisting force erupted from his waist muscles as his body twisted at an odd angle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s feet were still facing the Skeleton General’s side, but his torso had already turned to face Jiang Hao.</p>
<p>The bone spear stabbed at Zhou Wen, just brushed past his cheek. This left a faint wound on Zhou Wen’s cheek, but he remained stoic. Without even blinking, he threw a punch at Jiang Hao’s dagger.</p>
<p>A look of mockery flashed in Jiang Hao’s eyes. Although the Explosive Scaled Snake had left his body, he still had the bone breastplate protecting him. It was also a Legendary Companion Beast and, although it wasn’t a Strength-type, it augmented his Strength a little. It wasn’t something a typical Mortal stage human could withstand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the jade dagger was made of special materials. Not only did it have the ability to kill dimensional creatures, but it also had a terrifying sharpness to it.</p>
<p>“Die!” Jiang Hao steeled his heart as he exerted all his Strength, gathering it at the blade tip. He wanted to slice through Zhou Wen’s fingers.</p>
<p>“Dodge! You can’t handle it!” Li Xuan cried out in panic.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu spewed another mouthful of blood—a result of his anxiety, not his injuries.</p>
<p>At the instant the fist and blade met, a sanguine glow shimmered across Zhou Wen’s fist. The red carapace instantly wrapped around his fist, condensing like a dark red boxing glove.</p>
<p>“Companion Beast!” Jiang Hao’s eyes constricted as an ominous feeling arose in him.</p>
<p>As Mortal stage Companion Beasts were rare, he had subconsciously imagined the Companion Beast to be at the Legendary stage. This alarmed him greatly.</p>
<p>However, the distance between the fist and blade was just too narrow. Just as the thought came to Jiang Hao, Zhou Wen’s fist had already struck the blade of the jade dagger.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The mighty force tore through the blade as cracks rapidly extended, shattering the entire dagger, turning them into countless fragments.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s punch didn’t pause as it struck Jiang Hao’s dagger-wielding fist. It smashed the bones in his hand and arm.</p>
<p>The fractured bone tore out of Jiang Hao’s flesh as blood gushed out. Without the protection of the bone armor, his arm popped like popcorn. He flew out with a tragic cry.</p>
<p>All of this happened in a split second. As Xu Miantu watched, he glared with a wide-open mouth, momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was thrilled. Ignoring the Explosive Scaled Snake that embroiled him, he charged forward and smashed open Jiang Hao’s head in midair. There were no more chances for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was calm. After destroying Jiang Hao’s arm, his body twisted around like a loach and, using the momentum, lunged for the skeleton horse’s back. This made the Skeleton General miss once more.</p>
<p>Everything happened with such fluidity, as though it had been practiced countless times. It was a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is he?” Xu Miantu snapped to his senses as his mind was filled with puzzlement. He refused to believe that Zhou Wen was merely an ordinary high-schooler from Guide City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter25'>Chapter 25: Weakness</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Jiang Hao’s death signified the dissipation of his Companion Beast. The Explosive Scaled Snake and the bone armor Companion Beasts exploded, turning into bits of Primordial Energy that scattered across the land.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t have the luxury of time to entertain nonsensical thoughts like Xu Miantu. After finishing Jiang Hao, he rushed straight for the Skeleton General. At the same time, he shouted, “Zhou Wen, I’ll attract his attention. Try to find an opening to deliver the lethal strike.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen retreated. Just as the Skeleton General was about to chase after him, Li Xuan had already delivered a punch to the skeleton horse’s head.</p>
<p>This contained the Strength of a Black Knight, but all it did was cause the skeleton horse’s head to flinch and its feet to stagger for a moment.</p>
<p>“Pledge my life to defend the city…” The Skeleton General was enraged as the glow in his eyes burgeoned. He let out a furious roar as he charged at Li Xuan with his spear.</p>
<p>Li Xuan could barely kite the Skeleton General with the Black Knight’s powers, but he was completely suppressed. He had no means to counterattack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled around the skeleton horse without giving the Skeleton General a chance to attack him. From time to time, he would deliver a Vigor Divine Fist at the horse’s legs or body. It affected the skeleton horse’s mobility, giving Li Xuan a breather.</p>
<p>The two besieged the Skeleton General, but everything remained in a tizzy.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General in-game doesn’t seem this powerful? Zhou Wen was quite puzzled. He was certain of his judgment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only aspects like Strength or Speed, most importantly, the Skeleton General in-game was rather uniform in his attacks. It was obvious he was a NPC 1 in a game. But in real life, the Skeleton General was clearly more intelligent and autonomous than in-game. His combat experience seemed to be honed from multiple battles, making him completely different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t seen this phenomenon on the ordinary Skeleton Soldiers. Be it in-game or in real life, the Skeleton Soldiers shared the same rigidness.</p>
<p>What’s the reason? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to figure out the reason.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan was sent flying by the Skeleton General’s spear sweep, but he managed to stop himself after tumbling about eight meters.</p>
<p>He got to his feet and charged forward once again while enduring the pain. Meanwhile, he shouted, “This Skeleton General is a little odd. He appears to be getting stronger!”</p>
<p>If any other Mortal stage were to suffer such injuries, they would probably be dead, even if they had a Legendary Companion Beast protecting them.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan’s Invincible Connate Divine Art was indeed formidable. It allowed him to continue battling with full force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard of how potent Epic stage Primordial Energy Arts were in the past, but it was only today that he realized how disparate things were.</p>
<p>The Ascetic Meditation he cultivated had similar benefits to the Invincible Connate Divine Art. They were Primordial Energy Arts that strengthened one’s Constitution, but the differences were huge when a comparison was made. If he had suffered injuries as terrible as Li Xuan’s, it would be unlikely that he could get back on his feet.</p>
<p>As expected, I need to cultivate in a top-grade Primordial Energy Art. But where am I to get one? These things aren’t like Primordial Energy Skills that can drop from the game. Zhou Wen was slightly vexed.</p>
<p>In the schools of Earth’s League, especially in university, different Primordial Energy Arts would be taught. However, they were capped out at the Legendary stage. There weren’t any Epic stage Primordial Energy Arts to be taught. Zhou Wen had no chance of cultivating in such Primordial Energy Arts even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>“Bro, stop daydreaming. Help me finish him quickly!” Li Xuan was running about yelling while being pursued by the Skeleton General. The black armor that encased him had nearly shattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of helping. Instead, he said, “It’s useless. My Strength isn’t enough to injure it. I think it’s better we flee.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have a weaponized Companion Beast?” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It’s only a Mortal Companion Beast. Although the augmentation to Strength is great, it wouldn’t be very effective against such a Legendary stage dimensional creature,” Zhou Wen explained.</p>
<p>“Mortal Companion Beast?” Li Xuan immediately felt speechless.</p>
<p>The higher the grade of a dimensional creature, the easier it could condense a dimensional crystal. The chances of producing a Companion Egg was also higher. Therefore, it was the low-grade dimensional creatures that could hardly produce Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Therefore, a Mortal Companion Beast could be more expensive than his Black Knight Legendary Companion Beast, but at this juncture, money meant nothing.</p>
<p>“That’s bad. Although my Black Knight also augments my Strength, it mainly augments my defense. It’s not great when it comes to Strength… Damn it… I should have learned a few Primordial Energy Skills with potent destructive forces… Or I should have incubated a Strength-type Legendary Companion Beast…” Li Xuan said in regret.</p>
<p>“If not for your black armor protecting you, you would have died a couple of times. Having a Strength-type Legendary Companion Beast is useless,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Li Xuan no longer had the time to chat with Zhou Wen for the Skeleton General almost stabbed him in his thigh.</p>
<p>The Black Knight Companion Beast didn’t enhance his Speed, so Li Xuan was unable to dodge the Skeleton General’s thrusts. All he could do was rely on the black armor to resist the blows. It seemed quite tragic for it appeared as though he would be stabbed to death at any time.</p>
<p>The skeleton horse was too fast and, with Li Xuan not being at the Legendary stage, there was no way of escaping.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I beg you to save Brother Xuan.” Xu Miantu struggled to get up as he pleaded with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At this moment, Xu Miantu no longer had the arrogance from before. Instead, he treated Zhou Wen as a pillar of support.</p>
<p>Deep down, he no longer treated Zhou Wen as a higher schooler from a small city. Just the Mortal Companion Beast was not something the typical person could possess. From his point of view, Zhou Wen definitely had an extraordinary background.</p>
<p>And his previous actions made Xu Miantu believe that the former could save Li Xuan if he so wished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, “It’s not completely impossible, but I’m not sure if it will work.”</p>
<p>“We have to try it regardless,” Xu Miantu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly as he observed the Skeleton General but was thinking about the Skeleton General in-game.</p>
<p>He had fought the Skeleton General several times in-game. It wasn’t without any benefit because through his observations, he had noticed a weakness on the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t certain if the weakness in-game was the same in real life. After all, the Skeleton General was a lot more powerful in real life.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Zhou Wen could only give it a try.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan being pursued by the Skeleton General, Zhou Wen silently circled to the back and gradually approached to await an opportunity.</p>
<p>Without needing Zhou Wen to say a word, Li Xuan knew that he needed to create a window of opportunity for Zhou Wen. Li Xuan gritted his teeth and used his black armor to envelope the left area of his abdomen to take on the Skeleton General’s thrust.</p>
<p>When the sharp tip plunged into the black armor, it ripped apart Li Xuan’s flesh. However, before the spear could be retracted, he gripped the stone spear tightly.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen leaped up and jumped onto the Skeleton General’s back. He rode on the skeleton horse just like the Skeleton General while reaching out his hand at his target’s neck. Lodging the head up to the sky, he used his other hand which wore the Vigor Ant’s boxing glove, slamming it heavily at the Skeleton General’s eye sockets.</p>
<h3 id='chapter26'>Chapter 26: Sun Strafe Art</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>With the combined forces of Vigor Divine Fist and the Vigor boxing glove, the Skeleton General’s eye sockets cracked as Zhou Wen’s fist plunged straight in. The sanguine flame scattered immediately like splattering blood.</p>
<p>The Skeleton General, who had been retracting the spear with all his might, came to an abrupt halt. The next moment the bone spear fell to the ground, as all his bones scattered around him. Even the skeleton horse crumbled to a pile of rotting bones.</p>
<p>And inside the skull which Zhou Wen had collapsed, there was a slight red glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flipped the skull around and saw the red Companion Egg. It was the size of a goose egg, its entire body crystalline, like jade. Blood flames seemed to burn in it.</p>
<p>“A Companion Egg? Your luck ain’t bad. Unfortunately, you don’t have enough Primordial Energy to incubate a Legendary Companion Egg. Besides, that Skeleton General was a little odd. It’s best you don’t incubate it randomly.” Li Xuan was covered with wounds, but regardless of their sizes, they were beginning to close up and stop bleeding. It was clearly thanks to the Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want it?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan shook his head. “If it wasn’t for you, Miantu and I would be dead. Also, what use is a Companion Egg? Besides, I don’t really take a mere Legendary Companion Egg to heart. You should take it for yourself.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded without any intention of standing on ceremony. He directly stuffed the Skeleton General’s Companion Egg into his pocket before looking at Jiang Hao, whose head had ruptured. “Jiang Hao deserved this, but his death will definitely affect our results. It will probably be difficult for us to get into a reputable school.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan laughed when he heard that. “Rest easy. Once we leave, apply to any reputable school you like. I guarantee you your admission..”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu suffered grievous injuries and, although Li Xuan’s wounds didn’t worsen, they weren’t trivial either. He was also in need of medical attention. The trio stopped hunting Skeleton Soldiers and left Guide Ancient City directly after gathering all the bone beads.</p>
<p>After the invigilator inspected the number of bone beads and dimensional crystals, he sent Li Xuan and Xu Miantu for treatment. As for Zhou Wen, he headed home alone on public transport.</p>
<p>On the way back, he used his phone to enter the Ancient Imperial City dungeon once more. He wanted to confirm that the Skeleton General in-game was weaker than the one in real life.</p>
<p>As expected. It’s not an illusion of mine. The Skeleton General in-game is much weaker. It’s no wonder I suspected that he wasn’t a Legendary creature.</p>
<p>But even so, without Li Xuan to divert the Skeleton General’s attention, Zhou Wen was only capable of circling around the Skeleton General in-game. Killing him by his strength alone was almost impossible. The blood-colored avatar that Zhou Wen controlled had zero chance of getting close enough to smash through the Skeleton General’s eye sockets.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t mind. He continued circling around the Skeleton General with the blood-colored avatar. Since Zhou Wen knew the Skeleton General’s weakness, a solo-kill was just a matter of time. He just needed to do the best he could.</p>
<p>Back home, Zhou Wen continued his daily lifestyle. Apart from sleeping, he would be gaming even while eating or using the bathroom.</p>
<p>After repeated attempts, he finally relied on a perfect positioning to kill the Skeleton General.Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.com</p>
<p>Although the Skeleton General in-game didn’t drop a Companion Egg, it gave Zhou Wen a pleasant surprise—a Speed Crystal valued at 13.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen absorbed the Speed Crystal and immediately felt a jolt run through his body. It made him feel as if he was on cloud nine.</p>
<p>After a while, the feeling gradually dissipated. When Zhou Wen looked at his in-game stats, he was stunned.</p>
<p>He had absorbed a Speed Crystal valued at 13, so logically speaking, his Speed should have risen to 13. However, his Speed had only increased to 9, much lower than he expected.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen roughly understood why this was happening.</p>
<p>I was taught that although the effects of absorbing Legendary stage crystals are good at the Mortal stage, that doesn’t allow one’s body to rise to the level of a Legendary stage. Only by raising one’s Primordial Energy Art to a new realm would the absorption of a Legendary stage dimensional crystal raise one’s stats. From the looks of it, this is the reason. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he thought of this.</p>
<p>He originally intended on relying on Ascetic Meditation to advance to the Legendary stage, but after witnessing how formidable the Invincible Connate Divine Art was, it was apparent to him that advancing to the Legendary stage with Ascetic Meditation wasn’t the best choice.</p>
<p>But if I don’t use Ascetic Meditation to advance to the Legendary stage, how am I to obtain an Epic stage Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen was at a loss.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A few days later, the examination results were announced. Zhou Wen’s results in his various subjects put him amongst the top. He got second on the combat test, one spot below Li Xuan. He was ranked even higher than Xu Miantu, so it did seem that Jiang Hao’s death hadn’t affected his results.</p>
<p>While pondering over the matter, his phone suddenly rang. It was an unknown number.</p>
<p>Picking up the call, Li Xuan’s voice sounded over the phone. “Zhou Wen, have you seen the results? I should have given you first place, but I have some special use for being first place. So please forgive my shamelessness in taking first. I’ll make sure to compensate you in the future.”</p>
<p>“We agreed on being fourth, so getting second is good enough. I don’t really care for my placing as long as it doesn’t affect my university enrollment.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about that. I owe you one, so I have to repay you one day.” Li Xuan paused before continuing, “I’ll be studying at Sunset College in the future. Are you interested in joining me there? We can take care of one another as friends.”</p>
<p>“Sunset College?” Zhou Wen revealed a pensive look.</p>
<p>Sunset College was one of the top schools in the East District of the League. At the very least, it was ranked within the top ten. And there were dimensional zones inside Sunset College; therefore, students of Sunset College could enter them during their college years for actual combat. This was a boon compared to the typical university.</p>
<p>Entering Sunset College wasn’t a bad choice. The only thing that held Zhou Wen back was that Sunset College was located in Luoyang City and the An family was in Luoyang as well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to have close ties with the An family; thus, leaving him hesitant about choosing Sunset College.</p>
<p>Li Xuan did his best to persuade Zhou Wen to attend Sunset College, but all Zhou Wen said was that he would consider it.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen recalled something. An Jing had given him a USB drive, claiming that it was given to him by Zhou Lingfeng. Zhou Wen had been spending the past few days trying to take down the Skeleton General, so he had forgotten all about it. He had no idea what was on it.</p>
<p>After finding the USB drive, he inserted it into his computer and opened it. There was only one folder in it, labeled—Sun Strafe Art.</p>
<h3 id='chapter27'>Chapter 27: Elder</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly alarmed. He had heard of Sun Strafe Art. It was a Primordial Energy Art that reached the Epic stage and was in no way inferior to the Invincible Connate Divine Art when it came to fame. However, in comparison, the Sun Strafe Art was far more precious.</p>
<p>After all, the Invincible Connate Divine Art’s cultivation requirements were excessively harsh. In contrast, the Sun Strafe Art didn’t have that many requirements. As long as one was willing to work hard at it, even the most mediocre person could attain certain levels of achievement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sun Strafe Art was an extremely potent offensive Primordial Energy Art. It was far more popular than the Invincible Connate Divine Art that only strengthened one’s Constitution.</p>
<p>However, based on what Zhou Wen knew, the Sun Strafe Art was an exclusive Primordial Energy Art of some bigwig in the League. Apart from this bigwig’s descendants, no one else had the chance of obtaining it.</p>
<p>How did Dad get the Sun Strafe Art? It’s most likely obtained thanks to the An family, right? Zhou Wen had a guess in mind.</p>
<p>He didn’t reject the Sun Strafe Art because of this guess. Since Zhou Lingfeng had given it to him, he must have paid the corresponding price even if it was thanks to the An family. Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any reason to reject it and couldn’t ignore Zhou Lingfeng’s well-meant intentions.</p>
<p>After all, the number of things that Zhou Lingfeng had given him since he was young—apart from his living allowance—was limited to a handful.</p>
<p>He actually remembers that he has a son. Zhou Wen didn’t immediately look at the Sun Strafe Art. Switching off his computer, he pulled out the USB disk and prepared to get some food.</p>
<p>Cultivating a Primordial Energy Art wasn’t something that could be done in a day. Even though he had a 9-valued Primordial Energy as a foundation, making it faster for him to cultivate other Primordial Energy Arts, it still wasn’t something that could be mastered in a month or two. There wasn’t any rush.</p>
<p>Opening the fridge, he found nothing inside. Looking at the cardboard boxes in the corner of the living room, there wasn’t a single packet of instant noodles left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment and gave up the thought of getting a delivery. He washed his face, changed his clothes, and prepared to head out to get something to eat. He could also buy some food to stock up on the way.</p>
<p>At almost nine in the evening, there weren’t many pedestrians on the street.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from his grandfather when he was young that before the dimensional storms happened, even a small city like Guide City was lit up for the entire night. However, such scenes were very rare these days.</p>
<p>The dim street lamps left Zhou Wen a little uncomfortable. His anemia was also getting worse.</p>
<p>He had lost too much blood recently. Thankfully, he was young and sufficiently strong. If he were an elderly man, the amount of blood he expended was definitely something his body’s self-replenishment wouldn’t be able to keep up with. Things would have deteriorated much earlier.</p>
<p>“I’ll head to the supermarket to buy some brown sugar and make it into a syrup for drinking. Let’s hope this old wives’ tale can help in replenishing my blood,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.</p>
<p>He also knew, deep down, that it wasn’t going to be of much use. Even if he visited the doctor, it was unlikely to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve the excessive loss of blood was to prevent his blood-colored avatar from dying frequently in-game. As long as it didn’t die, he wouldn’t need to waste his blood.</p>
<p>Cough! As Zhou Wen was walking, he heard a man cough in front of him. Looking up, he saw an elderly man walking over with a hunched back. He had his head bowed, holding one hand to his mouth as he coughed from time to time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much of it as he continued proceeding forward. But to his surprise, the elderly man collapsed to the ground when he was less than three meters away from him.</p>
<p>“Uncle, are you alright?” Zhou Wen walked over to check on the elder.</p>
<p>The elder seemed weak as he sat on the ground without getting up. He said feebly, “I’m fine. Old age is getting at me. I’ll be fine after resting for a while.”</p>
<p>“Let me help you to the side.” Zhou Wen saw that there was a bus stop nearby which had benches for commuters to sit on.</p>
<p>With the elder nodding, Zhou Wen reached out, held him by the arm and helped him to the bench.</p>
<p>He observed the elder from the side and guessed that he was in his seventies to eighties. His hair was gray and his face was covered in wrinkles. However, from his thin face and facial features, this elder had probably been a handsome man in his prime.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt some pity for him. An elder at this age was truly from the most tragic generation.</p>
<p>When the dimensional storms descended upon the world, it created pandemonium. That decade or two was the most chaotic and darkest period of human history.</p>
<p>And the source of this chaos wasn’t the terrifying dimensional creatures, but humanity itself.</p>
<p>Most dimensional creatures were unable to leave the dimensional zones; therefore excluding those zones, humans in the other zones weren’t in too much danger.</p>
<p>However, when humans realized that they could have superpowers with the help of dimensional crystals, those who obtained these powers revealed the darkest side of humanity.</p>
<p>In this dark era, many vile and ambitious people who struck fear into people were produced. The number of deaths that arose among humanity’s infighting could be said to be awash with rivers of blood.</p>
<p>At the elder’s age, he was a person who had survived the dark era but he was also beyond his prime for cultivation during the same period. Back then, there weren’t any systematic education or resources available. Most men his age had never cultivated. And even if they did, their achievements were extremely limited.</p>
<p>To be lucky enough to not die in that dark and chaotic era and live to this day wasn’t something worth being happy about either.</p>
<p>Humans nowadays who cultivated from a young age not only had a strong immune system that made them less prone to falling sick, but the speed at which they aged was reduced. They also experienced an extension of their lifespan, something incomparable for the elder from that era.</p>
<p>Now, most people in their forties and fifties looked no different from the twenties or thirties of yesteryear.</p>
<p>Even if one grew old in the future, they wouldn’t be so frail like this elder in front of him.</p>
<p>“Uncle, if you’re fine, I’ll be taking my leave.” Seeing how the elder’s condition had improved, Zhou Wen planned on leaving.</p>
<p>“Lad, it’s a lucky coincidence that we meet other. Why don’t you have a chat with me?” the elder looked at Zhou Wen with his turbid eyes as he spoke with his feeble voice.</p>
<p>“I’m not good at chatting.” Zhou Wen wasn’t declining the elder’s request. He really wasn’t good at chatting.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Let me ask you a few questions.” The elder smiled, only to break into a coughing fit a moment later.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” Zhou Wen said and stood in front of the bench.</p>
<p>He usually only gamed and seldom communicated with people. Therefore, it didn’t seem like a bad thing to have someone willing to chat with him.</p>
<p>Of course, this was under the premise that the elder didn’t ask questions that stumped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Do you like women with big or small breasts?” The elder’s question left Zhou Wen taken aback.</p>
<h3 id='chapter28'>Chapter 28: Jing Daoxian</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was still a pure and innocent virgin who had never been in a relationship before. Furthermore, always being focused on cultivation, he had never considered this problem.</p>
<p>The elder’s question was somewhat odd, but Zhou Wen answered after some serious thought, “Women with smaller breasts.”</p>
<p>The elder was delighted to hear that as he said with a smile, “That’s exactly what I think too. Only women with smaller breasts are beautiful. What’s so nice about big-breasted women? They are no different from cows. Only babies who still suck on their mother’s tit will like cows.”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t agree with the elder, he didn’t think it worth arguing with him. He chose women with smaller breasts because having big breasts made it unsuitable for combat. It would affect one’s sense of balance.</p>
<p>The elder’s complexion seemed a lot better once he broached the topic of women. He continued asking in excitement, “Lad, let me ask you another question. Do you like gentle women who are docile and obedient or women who are shrewd and unreasonable?”</p>
<p>This old man sure is odd. Does he have a screw loose? Who wouldn’t like a docile and obedient woman and instead like an unreasonable shrewd?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the intention of answering that he preferred docile women, but he felt that choosing this would only excite the elder even more. There would then be no end to the conversation. Besides, Zhou Wen had no interest in continuing his chat with the elder.</p>
<p>“I like shrewd and unreasonable women,” Zhou Wen swallowed the words he wanted to say and spoke against his will.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the elder smacked his thigh before Zhou Wen could even finish his sentence. He said in great excitement, “Not bad! Not bad! It’s only when women are shrewd and unreasonable that they are cute and fun. Those docile and obedient women are no different from dead fish. What’s so fun about that? I never expected a young lad like you would have such refined taste in women…”</p>
<p>The way the elder treated Zhou Wen as though he was a confidant left him bewildered. He was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>He’s a lunatic indeed. Zhou Wen was increasingly convinced that the elder wasn’t mentally sound. Otherwise, how could he have said such inane stuff?</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had chosen honestly, he definitely wouldn’t have chosen unreasonable shrewd women.</p>
<p>“Uncle, where do you live? Do you need me to take you home?” Zhou Wen really didn’t want to be caught up here. All he wanted was to send the elder off and find somewhere to eat so that he could return to his gaming.</p>
<p>The elder ignored Zhou Wen and continued rambling, “Lad, you have exquisite taste when it comes to women. You are a genius. However, you don’t look good and your body condition isn’t great. One’s body is crucial when hitting on chicks. If you don’t have a good body, you will be lacking in the strength needed, despite having good taste…”</p>
<p>What the hell? You call this good taste? Zhou Wen regretted agreeing to the elder’s request for a chat.</p>
<p>Having said that, the elder groped around before pulling out a tattered diary. “You are quite a fine lad and are rather compatible with me. Written in here is a Primordial Energy Art. If you cultivate it, it will be beneficial for you. As long as you can master it, you will have the strength to deal with any problematic women in the future.”</p>
<p>A dark cloud hovered over Zhou Wen. The elder seemed to be implying that the cultivation of Primordial Energy Arts was meant to deal with unreasonable shrewd women.</p>
<p>“Uncle, thanks for the offer. However, I’ve already cultivated in a Primordial Energy Art. I don’t need any others.” Zhou Wen already had the Sun Strafe Art, so he naturally wasn’t very interested in other Primordial Energy Arts. Furthermore, he doubted that the elder’s Primordial Energy Art was anything impressive.</p>
<p>The elder glanced at Zhou Wen and said in contempt, “Although this Skyfiend Treatise isn’t a top-grade Primordial Energy Art, it’s not anything your crappy one can compare with. Useless Primordial Energy Arts like Ascetic Meditation are meant for trash. You are a lad with exquisite taste. You shouldn’t be cultivating in such a trashy Primordial Energy Art.”</p>
<p>“How do you know I cultivate in Ascetic Meditation?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>The elder curled his lips. “Although you don’t look well, there’s a yellow jade-like luster suffusing your skin and flesh. Your eyes are spirited and your bones are huge. Clear signs of cultivating Ascetic Meditation. However, it’s also at the beginner level. It’s good that you are still a beginner; otherwise, cultivating such a trashy Primordial Energy Art would have been a waste of your youth. It would have ruined your entire life.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the elder. He hadn’t noticed before that this sickly old man was so keen.</p>
<p>As though reading his mind, the elder said, “Dazed? This Skyfiend Treatise is hundreds if not thousands of times better than Ascetic Meditation. It’s stronger than any Epic stage Primordial Energy Art at present. As long as you master it, you would definitely amount to much in the future. Although it wouldn’t make you invincible, it wouldn’t be difficult for you to advance to the Epic stage.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I can’t accept something this valuable from a stranger. I’m very grateful for your kind intentions, but if there’s nothing else, I’ll be making a move now.” Zhou Wen didn’t know about the authenticity of the elder’s Skyfiend Treatise for he had never heard of such an Epic stage Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>Regardless if it was one, Zhou Wen already had the Sun Strafe Art. There was no need for him to cultivate in the Skyfiend Treatise of unknown origins.</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen turned around as he prepared to leave. With the elder’s queer actions, he didn’t wish to attract more trouble. It was best he left as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Stop right there.” Just as Zhou Wen turned around, he heard the elder’s cold bellow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ignore him and leave, but just as he opened his stride, he felt as though his body was being grabbed by a huge invisible hand. It yanked him back, turning him around to face the elder.</p>
<p>The elder’s turbid eyes were shimmering with a fearsome glint that resembled light bulbs.</p>
<p>He sat on the bench as he coughed slightly with his hand over his mouth. However, Zhou Wen could only stand motionless in front of the elder due to the invisible hand.</p>
<p>“I, Jing Daoxian, have reigned supreme for decades and no one has ever lived to say no to me.” The elder glared at Zhou Wen as he spoke coldly.</p>
<p>He found the words “Jing Daoxian” familiar; however, it was only when he matched this name to a memory did his expression change drastically.</p>
<p>When the dimensional storms first happened—in the period before the League government was established when it was the most chaotic period in human history—there had been a vile and bloodthirsty people. The most terrifying and evil of them all was named Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>The legends of Jing Daoxian’s cruelty was enough for a novelist to write an epic tale, spanning ten million words or more.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian was most infamous for storming the League government’s office, killing twenty-seven Epic experts. The rest of the lower-stage experts were too numerous to count. He had turned what represented the highest authority of the League into a river of blood.</p>
<h3 id='chapter29'>Chapter 29: Lost Immortal Sutra</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Many of the history books in the League had depicted that battle, the Day of the Fiendish Calamity. As for Jing Daoxian, he had the nickname of Fiend King. The number of Epic experts back then weren’t as numerous as the number these days, so to kill twenty-seven Epic experts basically meant slaughtering most of humanity’s strongest experts. It set back humanity’s strength by at least ten years.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the elder in front of him, finding it difficult to put this sickly old man with the terrifying Fiend King of legends.</p>
<p>“You are Fiend King Jing Daoxian?” Zhou Wen didn’t feel horrified because of his restrainment. This was because he knew very well that it didn’t make a difference.</p>
<p>“Do you now want it?” Jing Daoxian said to Zhou Wen with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate in answering for he had no intention of dying at the hands of this devil.</p>
<p>When Jing Daoxian heard Zhou Wen’s reply, he narrowed his eyes and said, “You may say so, but you don’t want it deep down. Even if you take it, I’m afraid you wouldn’t cultivate in it.”</p>
<p>Is this guy nuts? Zhou Wen thought. “I’m naturally not going to cultivate in it. If that Skyfiend Treatise is really a Primordial Energy Art of yours, wouldn’t the League’s government believe that I’m related to you if I were to master it? I would also be wanted.”</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian fell silent for a moment before his eyes lit up as though he had thought of something. Putting the notebook away, he took out something else.</p>
<p>It was a violet, metal box that resembled copper. However, it didn’t have the luster of copper with its dark, brushed-metal texture.</p>
<p>Looking small and exquisite, the metal box was squarish, about the size of a cigarette case. Carved on it were strange and messy patterns with three words written vertically in the middle.</p>
<p>“Lost Immortal Sutra!” Zhou Wen recognized the three words but didn’t understand what they meant.</p>
<p>The elder held the tiny box in front of Zhou Wen before lifting the lid. At this moment, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t a box but pieces of violet metal sheets that were connected to one another. They were like violet metal name cards.</p>
<p>There was a total of thirteen extremely thin, violet sheets. Each one was engraved with words the size of a fly’s head. Due to the tiny text, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to read the words on them.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian didn’t look at the words on them. After opening it, all he did was wave the sheets in front of Zhou Wen before stacking them back together, turning them back into the violet metal block that resembled a cigarette case. Finally, he stuffed it into Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>“A Primordial Energy Art is written on it. It’s rather interesting, so take your time to cultivate it.” Jing Daoxian gave an odd smile, revealing his white teeth. It gave Zhou Wen the creeps.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian stuffed the Lost Immortal Sutra into Zhou Wen’s hands before walking away amidst coughs with his back hunched. Soon, he vanished from the dark street.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen feel the invisible force around his body dissipate. Having regained control of his body, he glanced at the direction in which Jing Daoxian had vanished. Unable to see him, he hurriedly looked down at the metal slab in his hand.</p>
<p>The history books speak of Jing Daoxian as having an eccentric and unreasonable temperament. He does things as he pleases. It’s really an apt description. Legend has it that Jing Daoxian was capricious, killing people in a way no different from having his meals. He had no sense of morals. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian was nice enough to give him a high-grade Primordial Energy Art due to a lucky encounter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed the metallic slab but failed to find anything special about it. Without opening it, it looked like a metal cigarette case.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen didn’t check the Lost Immortal Sutra’s contents. He had the mysterious phone and Sun Strafe Art that destined him to become an expert. There was no need for him to take the risk of cultivating a Primordial Energy Art given to him by Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Hesitating for a moment while holding the metallic slab, Zhou Wen carefully placed it in his pocket.</p>
<p>Firstly, he was afraid that Jing Daoxian was watching nearby. If he were to throw it away, he was afraid that Jing Daoxian would flare up into a rage and kill him.</p>
<p>Secondly, Zhou Wen didn’t know if there were any harmful traps in the Lost Immortal Sutra. He wasn’t sure if others would be harmed if he just threw it away.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction that Jing Daoxian had vanished, Zhou Wen turned around and headed for the supermarket.</p>
<p>At the moment he turned around, Jing Daoxian, who was standing on another street, curled his lips. He sneered with an odd expression. I originally wanted to give you an opportunity for catching my fancy. Who knew that you are such a philistine. No one can live comfortably in this world after rejecting me. You’ll die regardless of whether you cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra. If there’s anything to blame, blame it on yourself for not knowing better.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jing Daoxian frowned slightly. Did they catch up that quickly?</p>
<p>With that said, Jing Daoxian walked towards the other end of the city, quickly vanishing from the city’s landscape.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen walked far, he saw people running toward him from the street ahead. They were wearing black uniforms that resembled a police uniform, but there were some differences. Despite carefully looking at it, he failed to recognize the uniform.</p>
<p>There were men and women in the group, with all of them looking to be in their twenties or thirties. The person leading them was a man in his thirties. He was clean-shaven other than the thin mustache above his lips. He was thin, with a hooked nose, and his eyes were as sharp as a blade.</p>
<p>“Hey there, did you see an elder in his seventies or eighties when you came from there?” The person ran past Zhou Wen without giving him a second glance. However, before they went far, the man who led the group stopped and turned to ask Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I think there was one. He headed in that direction.” Zhou Wen pointed in the direction where Jing Daoxian had left.</p>
<p>The man observed Zhou Wen for a moment before he nodded and said his thanks. Then, he led the group of uniformed personnel in the direction Zhou Wen had pointed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited until they were a distance away before he turned around and briskly walked off. He really didn’t wish to embroil himself in such trouble. He sought a life of gaming in peace while schooling.</p>
<p>This time, he finally arrived at the supermarket without any mishap and bought plenty of food. Like always, Zhou Wen headed home and continued his grinding fest.</p>
<p>He gamed past one in the morning before he forced himself to put down the phone and go to bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sleep quality had always been good. This might have something to do with his talent in being able to get into a focused state when learning something. It was the same with sleep. He could fall asleep within three seconds of lying down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that he would be able to sleep till daybreak, but he felt something amiss while sleeping in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen was able to sleep the entire night unless roused up by someone. But today was different. The room was so silent that one could hear a pin drop; yet, Zhou Wen woke up.</p>
<h3 id='chapter30'>Chapter 30: Sleep Paralysis</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Badump! Badump!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his heart beating like a drum as it raced faster and faster. It gave him a feeling that his heart would literally leap out of his chest.</p>
<p>Could this heart arrhythmia be a result of my frequent loss of blood? Zhou Wen had never experienced this before. He intended to open his eyes and get up to ease the discomfort.</p>
<p>However, he could neither open his eyes nor sit up. He wasn’t even able to move his fingers. The feeling was akin to the desire to urinate while dreaming, but being unable to get up.</p>
<p>What’s happening? Zhou Wen felt an ominous feeling rise up in him. He was certain that he wasn’t dreaming for his mind was extremely lucid.</p>
<p>What made him feel worse was that he felt as though something was pressing down on him. It was growing in weight, leaving him stifled. He could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>Even so, Zhou Wen still couldn’t open his eyes. Nor could he move. It appeared as though he couldn’t wake up from his dream.</p>
<p>Could this be the ghost oppression that Grandfather was speaking of when I was little? He thought.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s father was very busy with work and he lacked a mother, he was brought up by his grandfather from a young age. Every evening, his grandfather would tell him stories to coax him to sleep.</p>
<p>As for his grandfather’s stories, they were mostly ghost stories. Perhaps one of them was the story of the mysterious phone. However, Zhou Wen was still young back then, so he didn’t remember most of them. Only a few especially frightening ones had left a deep impression on him until today. One of them was about ghost oppression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that his present situation was very similar to the ghost oppression his grandfather had spoken of. His mind was very lucid, but he couldn’t wake up or move.</p>
<p>It felt as though a heavy object was pressing on him as his heart raced. It left him extremely uncomfortable, to the point of retching. Yet, he couldn’t do so.</p>
<p>This feeling continued from the middle of the night until just after six in the morning. Only then did Zhou Wen recover the control of his body. He instantly got up, ran to the bathroom, and vomited into the toilet.</p>
<p>Even as he was about to vomit his bile, he remained somewhat in discomfort.</p>
<p>What’s wrong? It couldn’t be as simple as food poisoning, right? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of his encounter with Jing Daoxian last night. He couldn’t help but be alarmed. Don’t tell me it has to do with Jing Daoxian?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen washed his face before heading to the living room. He picked up the stack of violet metal sheets he had stored away in a drawer.</p>
<p>It hadn’t experienced any changes and the words were clearly engraved on the metal, neither too deep nor too shallow.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian is known for being capricious. He definitely wasn’t up to any good by giving me the Lost Immortal Sutra after I rejected him. Perhaps the problem stems from this metal slab. Could it be that he poisoned me? Zhou Wen suspected that Jing Daoxian had placed some form of hallucinogen on the violet metal slab that could seep into the body through contact.</p>
<p>He had learned such general knowledge in school, and he did pretty well in his studies. Using tweezers, he placed the violet slab in a glass container and did a simple test. However, he didn’t find any poisonous reactions.</p>
<p>There isn’t any poison? Or could the poison be relatively special and prevent ordinary methods of discovering it? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>With all of that done, Zhou Wen felt that his body had recovered. His heart had calmed down and he no longer felt nauseous.</p>
<p>He suspected a case of food poisoning, so he took some digestive medicine. His body seemed to fully recover and there weren’t any further abnormalities.</p>
<p>As he took note of his body, he began grinding in-game. Now, Zhou Wen was already capable of singlehandedly killing the Skeleton General in-game. He just required quite a bit of time, taking nearly an hour to kill the Skeleton General once.</p>
<p>Nothing dropped when he killed the Skeleton General in-game a second time. It left him somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Unwilling to waste his blood to restart the Ancient Imperial City dungeon, he decided to venture deeper into it.</p>
<p>The ancient buildings were connected like a massive maze. Zhou Wen had the intention of heading into one of the ancient buildings to take a look, but he was afraid of dying, making it a waste of blood.</p>
<p>The deeper he headed into Ancient Imperial City, the more Skeleton Soldiers he encountered. Towards the end, he had encountered tides of Skeleton Soldiers that he couldn’t clear no matter how hard he tried. Yet, there was no sight of a Skeleton General.</p>
<p>This continued late into the night and the streets were filled with endless numbers of skeletons. Giving up, Zhou Wen stormed out of the area and chose to quit the game.</p>
<p>He hadn’t had a good night’s sleep the previous night, so his fatigue was getting to him. He decided to sleep early to spruce himself up for tomorrow’s continued efforts.</p>
<p>It didn’t take him long to fall asleep, but not long after, he snapped awake again. He was suffering from sleep paralysis again.</p>
<p>His heart raced as something heavy pressed down on him. He felt extreme discomfort.</p>
<p>Damn it… It’s definitely not as simple as food poisoning… It must have been Jing Daoxian… Zhou Wen had the urge to curse.</p>
<p>He had no grudge with Jing Daoxian. He had just declined Jing Daoxian’s offer of the Skyfiend Treatise and this was the outcome. He was truly loathsome.</p>
<p>After enduring through the night, the feeling vanished at dawn. Roughly at the same time as the day before, Zhou Wen once again regained control of his body.</p>
<p>He got up again and rushed to the bathroom. The vomiting was worse than yesterday, making him feel as though he was about to vomit out his stomach.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, the discomfort quickly vanished. If it wasn’t because of the excruciating pain from before and his vomit still in the toilet, Zhou Wen would have thought that his discomfort was nothing but an illusion.</p>
<p>He was very certain that the problem was likely a result of Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>To seek him out was clearly unpragmatic.</p>
<p>The entire League had Jing Daoxian on a wanted list for decades but had failed to apprehend him. It was nearly impossible for a higher schooler like Zhou Wen to find him.</p>
<p>Even if he were lucky and ended up finding Jing Daoxian, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he possessed the means to redress this injustice.</p>
<p>After some thought, he took out the Lost Immortal Sutra slab. Without any hesitation, he flipped through it and read its contents.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had told him that it recorded an interesting Primordial Energy Art that he should cultivate in. This made Zhou Wen believe that the resolution to his problems lay in the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Although this thought didn’t seem to hinge on anything reliable, Zhou Wen was without options. All he could do was first figure out what Lost Immortal Sutra was before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id='chapter31'>Chapter 31: Unmemorable Sutra</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Thirteen violet metal sheets were connected to each other like a mini-comic book. Its contents were viewable the moment he opened it. There were tiny words densely packed on every page and on both sides.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen began reading from the back of the first page. It was indeed the opening of a typical Primordial Energy Art. It mentioned things like the human magnetic field and Primordial Energy Art. As he read it, Zhou Wen suddenly felt hungry. Recalling that his favorite salted eggs were among the food he had bought yesterday, he put down the Lost Immortal Sutra and peeled one to add it to a bowl of instant noodles.</p>
<p>After he had finished eating, he returned to read Lost Immortal Sutra, only to realize that he had forgotten his reading progress.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He was confident in his memory and although it wasn’t a photographic one, he wouldn’t forget anything he read for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Yet, in less than ten minutes, he had forgotten the few lines he had just read.</p>
<p>Reading the Lost Immortal Sutra again, he was astonished to realize that it wasn’t as simple as forgetting his reading progress. When he read it from the beginning, he found the content equally unfamiliar as though it was the first time he was reading it. He had apparently forgotten all the content he had read just minutes ago.</p>
<p>There’s indeed something odd about this! Zhou Wen continued reading before finding himself feeling hungry again. He needed some more food.</p>
<p>This moment of distraction was enough to make him forget his reading progress in Lost Immortal Sutra. When he read from the beginning, he found the content he had just read unfamiliar once more. He had forgotten the content again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen refused to have his beliefs shaken as he picked up his phone, opened its notes app, and began recording the content he read from the violet sheet.</p>
<p>However, whenever Zhou Wen memorized a sentence and turned his gaze to the phone, he would find his thoughts a blank when he tried to input the content. He couldn’t recall the line he had just memorized.</p>
<p>After attempting to memorize the Lost Immortal Sutra again, Zhou Wen quickly discovered that he could clearly remember the content when reading it, but once he moved his gaze away in a bid to record it, everything would be forgotten.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to write as he read, but it was useless. Just any level of distraction was enough to wipe his memories of Lost Immortal Sutra’s content.</p>
<p>He tried using his phone to snap pictures of the Lost Immortal Sutra, but after taking a few pictures, he found that the pictures only showed the metal sheet being a uniform violet color without any engravings.</p>
<p>This Lost Immortal Sutra is indeed odd. Not only can’t I divert my attention to read it, but I’ll be affected by the text within when focusing, getting distracted by my various emotions. It’s truly bizarre. Zhou Wen thought as he looked at the Lost Immortal Sutra engraved on the metal sheets.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to him, this Lost Immortal Sutra wasn’t only simple but bizarre. He just experienced distractions in the beginning, but towards the end, it escalated to something far more fatal.</p>
<p>Many Epic stage experts in history had died because of reading of Lost Immortal Sutra. Even if they were lucky to survive, they would go crazy and become no different from an idiot.</p>
<p>Even Jing Daoxian wasn’t able to finish reading Lost Immortal Sutra after obtaining it. He closed it after reading it midway without daring to continue. If it wasn’t because the Lost Immortal Sutra had a magical connection to its owner, making it impossible to forcefully abandon it, Jing Daoxian wouldn’t have kept it on him.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because of the influence that Lost Immortal Sutra exerted on him, Jing Daoxian wouldn’t have been injured inside a dimensional zone. He had originally planned on finding a way of disposing of it.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen declined Jing Daoxian’s Skyfiend Treatise, the latter was insistent that Zhou Wen cultivated in the Primordial Energy Art he had given. Not only did he want Zhou Wen to cultivate it, but he also wanted Zhou Wen to suffer for his actions. He even wanted him to die a tragic death. This was the reason why he had given the Lost Immortal Sutra to him.</p>
<p>His vile nature was absolutely nothing the average person could compare with. He was truly a devil.</p>
<p>Due to the strangeness of the Lost Immortal Sutra, Zhou Wen didn’t continue reading. He even wanted to experiment if anything would happen to him if he distanced himself from the metal slab and the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a hotel suite in Guide City, a few people were sitting around a table, discussing something. If Zhou Wen were around, he would have recognized them to be the uniformed personnel he had met that fateful night.</p>
<p>“We let Jing Daoxian escape once again. Damn it,” a man said angrily.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy for them to acquire clues of Jing Daoxian’s whereabouts. Furthermore, the latter was heavily injured, giving them their best chance of apprehending him. Yet, they had still failed to catch up to him.</p>
<p>“Despite being so heavily injured, how did he break through our blockade and escape without us realizing it,” a woman said, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Regardless of how injured he is, he is still Jing Daoxian nonetheless. We shouldn’t take it to heart. If we had locked down all of Guide City in the beginning, we might have stood a chance of finding him.”</p>
<p>Everyone exchanged their views, except for a man who remained silent. At the seat of honor, he rhythmically tapped the table’s surface as he hung his eyelids low, seemingly in thought.</p>
<p>“Minister Qiao, what’s your take on this?” a blonde, green-eyed lady gave the man a teasing look as she asked with a coquettish voice.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan looked up slightly when he heard her question. Stopping his tapping of the table, he swept his gaze across everyone.</p>
<p>“How long did Jing Daoxian spend in Guide City, from the moment he entered until he left?” Qiao Siyuan didn’t reply to the lady’s question and returned with a question.</p>
<p>The woman switched on her tablet and said after taking a look at the information. “For a person like Jing Daoxian with extremely powerful perception, it won’t be easy for cameras to capture any traces of him. Thankfully, the Eye in the Sky is a rather well-refined system. There are certain areas that make it impossible to escape surveillance. From the video feed we have at present, we can determine that Jing Daoxian entered Guide City at approximately 8:30 p.m. and left at 9:20 p.m., spending a total of fifty minutes in Guide City.</p>
<p>After Qiao Siyuan heard this, he picked up his pen and drew out a red line on Guide City’s map. “This is the path we took while pursuing Jing Daoxian. Based on the information we have at present, he has suffered grievous injuries, so he can’t advance too quickly. In addition, there are no reports of him using any transportation.”</p>
<p>“Based on the snapshots occasionally taken by the Eye in the Sky, that’s indeed the case. Jing Daoxian didn’t walk very quickly, reaching the square’s vicinity at approximately 8:55 p.m….” the lady briefed him in detail.</p>
<p>“Then, did you notice that the distance between Xiangjun Road to Changjiang Road only takes up less than 5% of his entire trajectory in Guide City. Yet, he spent nearly ten minutes there. Can someone tell me why?” Qiao Siyuan glared at everyone as he asked.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he needed to tend to his wounds?” a young man suggested.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan said stoically, “Does anyone of you remember our encounter with a high-schooler on that stretch of road?”</p>
<p>Everyone took some time to recall. When the lady realized what he was talking about, she hurriedly said, “The youth who you asked about Jing Daoxian’s direction of escape?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter32'>Chapter 32: Sunset College’s New Discovery</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Qiao Siyuan nodded gently. “That’s right. He’s the one.”</p>
<p>“Minister, do you think that youth is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian?” the blonde, green-eyed lady asked Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan focused on the laid-out map on the table before saying, “No. He’s likely an ordinary high-schooler. However, since he met Jing Daoxian in that period of time, perhaps we might be able to understand why Jing Daoxian had spent abnormal amounts of time in that area through him. Think of a way to find that high-schooler.”</p>
<p>Everyone exchanged looks. They hadn’t especially taken note of the youth that passed them by. Furthermore, it was in the evening and the youth hadn’t worn anything that made himself stand out. To seek him out without a clue left them somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>“I’ll sketch up the youth for you. To appear in that vicinity at that time while wearing home clothes means that he lives nearby. Check the nearby cameras to see if they managed to capture him. Bring him back as quickly as possible,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>With the Lost Immortal Sutra in hand, Zhou Wen originally had the intention of leaving it somewhere far from home. However, the moment he left his doorstep, he saw a car parked along the street. Li Xuan was inside the car, waving at him.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong?” Zhou Wen walked over and asked.</p>
<p>“Get in the car first.” Li Xuan opened the door and moved inside, gesturing for him to get in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and got in.</p>
<p>Li Xuan closed the door and rolled up the window. Then, he unlocked his phone and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Take a look at this.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave him a suspicious glance and discovered that there was a picture shown on the screen—a document.</p>
<p>As the text was too tiny, Zhou Wen had no choice but to swipe across the phone’s screen to zoom in. Only then did he see what the document was about.</p>
<p>It appeared to be a draft, indicating that a new dimensional zone had been found in the vicinity of Ancient Inlet. Furthermore, Companion Beasts in the form of organs had been discovered inside. The report then provided some data and analysis.</p>
<p>“Why are you showing me this?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan with a perplexed look.</p>
<p>Li Xuan answered in excitement, “Ancient Inlet is inside Sunset College. This newly discovered dimensional zone will be Sunset College’s in the future.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhou Wen still didn’t get Li Xuan’s excitement.</p>
<p>“So what? It means that students of Sunset College will have the opportunity of entering this newly discovered dimensional zone in the future. They will have a chance of obtaining organ-type Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s unfazed expression, Li Xuan continued, “Companion Beasts in the form of organs are extremely rare. You might not have heard of them, but I can very responsibly tell you that those things are a lot more precious than the typical Companion Beast. Let me put it this way. If your heart were to be wrecked by someone or if you were on your deathbed with a heart disease, having a Companion Beast in the shape of a heart means it could fuse with your heart and replace your original heart. It would enhance your heart’s functionality…”</p>
<p>“It does sound useful.” Zhou Wen finally had a chance to speak after listening for a period of time.</p>
<p>“It’s far from useful. Let me ask you. Do you know how many elderly people in the League die a year from heart diseases? And how many people die from tumors in their organs? Organ-type Companion Beasts can be sold for astronomical prices. Besides, even if you don’t sell it and keep it for yourself, it will be equivalent to having an additional life when you adventure in dimensional zones…”</p>
<p>Li Xuan droned on before ending with one statement. “The benefits of that dimensional zone producing organ-type Companion Beasts is something only members of Sunset College can enjoy. Don’t hesitate any further. Follow me to Sunset College. Delay any further and it will be too late. If this piece of news is officially announced, all the top students across the country will swarm to apply at Sunset College. That special admissions quota won’t be enough.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll head back and do the registration.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate and agreed to it.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t wish to have ties with the An family, he also didn’t wish for the An family to affect his normal life. Since applying to Sunset College brought about so many benefits, there was no reason for him to give it up, much less give it up because of the An family.</p>
<p>“Fill in the application on the Internet before handing me your identification card. Leave the rest to me,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>In fact, after Zhou Wen had his college entrance examination results, all he needed to do was apply at Sunset College’s official website and await admission.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s results, it wasn’t a problem for him to be admitted under ordinary circumstances. However, things were no longer the same. Once the discovery of organ-type Companion Beasts had been announced, competition for the limited number of spots would become intense. Zhou Wen might not be admitted as a result.</p>
<p>Li Xuan took Zhou Wen’s identification card and planned on using some of his connections to get him admitted to Sunset College.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t speak further. After registering on the website with his phone, he gave his identification card to Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“That should be it. I’ll be heading back to Luoyang. If there’s nothing else for you here, pack up and head with me to Luoyang. I’ll take you around to familiarize you with Luoyang and Sunset College’s campus,” Li Xuan said as he put away the identification card.</p>
<p>“Alright. Wait a moment.” Zhou Wen got out of the car and headed home to pack up.</p>
<p>“Wait? I’ll help you with the packing.” Li Xuan got out of the car and followed Zhou Wen home.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much to pack to begin with. After packing up some of his daily necessities and clothes, he left Guide City with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Guide City wasn’t too far from Luoyang. Before the dimensional storms happened, it took about three to four hours by car.</p>
<p>However, many areas these days had turned into dimensional zones. Circling around them doubled the journey time at the very least, so it took them more than ten hours to get there.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had wanted to have a good chat with Zhou Wen, but to his dismay, Zhou Wen began gaming the moment he got into the car. His eyes stayed peeled to the screen, leaving Li Xuan somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Is this guy for real? Does he have such skills despite being so obsessed with gaming? Li Xuan was very experienced when it came to acting—especially when it came to playing the pig to prey on tigers.</p>
<p>But regardless of how he looked at it, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be acting. He truly looked obsessed with gaming.</p>
<p>Li Xuan sat there watching Zhou Wen game for quite a while before becoming extremely bored. Wasn’t it just the constant grinding of some monster ants? Such repetitive and boring games had lost favor decades ago.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, is that game so fun?” Bored after watching for a while, Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“It’s fun,” Zhou Wen said without looking away from the screen.</p>
<p>As he was afraid that Li Xuan had noticed something, he didn’t enter the Ancient Imperial City. Instead, he kept grinding at the Ant Nest.</p>
<p>After obtaining the mysterious phone, Zhou Wen had already looked up most of the dimensional zones on Earth. Although there were a few dimensional zones that resembled the Ant Nest, they were different from the one in-game. Vigor Ants didn’t exist either.</p>
<h3 id='chapter33'>Chapter 33: Undistracted</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Li Xuan found it boring as he closed his eyes to circulate his Primordial Energy to begin cultivating his Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, he controlled his blood-colored avatar and stormed towards the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Although he had the experience gleaned from killing the Skeleton General—a Legendary stage creature—he found his ability falling short when facing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. He was killed after a few clashes.</p>
<p>This Silver-Winged Flying Ant seems more difficult to deal with than the Skeleton General. It’s faster and it has the ability of flight. It’s unrestricted due to the lack of the skeleton horse. Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He originally thought that he had improved significantly over the recent period of time, but after a clash with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, he realized how small the improvement was.</p>
<p>If I can incubate the Skeleton General’s Companion Egg, I should be able to kill the Silver-Winged Flying Ant using the Skeleton General’s strength to fight it. Unfortunately, as I don’t have the Invincible Connate Divine Art, it’s almost impossible for me to incubate a Legendary stage Companion Egg at the Mortal stage. As Zhou Wen thought over the matter, he went back to his original thoughts of combining Inch Punch and Vigor Divine Fist.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have the means to practice while in the car. Having reached a bottleneck in-game and unable to make any progress, he felt that it was pointless continuing for it was a waste of his blood.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Xuan enter a cultivation state and with the driver not taking a look back at the situation, Zhou Wen took out the Lost Immortal Sutra and planned on reading the contents within.</p>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra had the ability to perplex the mind. Even a terrifying expert like Jing Daoxian was unable to focus fully to finish reading the text.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. As the former principal of Guide High School had mentioned, Zhou Wen could be absolutely focused on anything if he so wished. This was the main reason for his excellent studies and fast cultivation.</p>
<p>Now, with Zhou Wen’s mind completely settled, he read the Lost Immortal Sutra without any distractions. The power of the text that could perplex the human mind failed to distract Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>The focused Zhou Wen just wanted to finish reading the contents; his brain didn’t have any capacity for second thoughts. So even though the textual power of the Lost Immortal Sutra was extremely bewitching, the thoughts failed to distract him.</p>
<p>No one had ever been able to read Lost Immortal Sutra from cover to cover; yet, Zhou Wen managed to do so without any incidents occurring. Zhou Wen was completely engrossed as he finished reading it.</p>
<p>Humans had a plethora of emotions that could cause them to be enticed by various things. Even Buddha found it difficult to remain unmoved. So although it wasn’t the case that there wasn’t anyone who could finish reading the Lost Immortal Sutra, there was only a handful.</p>
<p>People like Zhou Wen, who could dedicate himself once they made up their mind to be truly focused, were an extremely small minority in the League. Even Epic stage bigwigs whose strength far exceeded Zhou Wen couldn’t achieve this focused state of mind.</p>
<p>Even the immortals of heaven would be lost to the enticement, giving Lost Immortal Sutra its name.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen managed to read it from cover to cover without being perplexed by the textual power. The Lost Immortal Sutra which had never been read by others finally appeared in Zhou Wen’s eyes in their entirety.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen had finished reading the final word of Lost Immortal Sutra, he suddenly felt his body quake. Primordial Energy in his body began automatically flowing at some point in time.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had cultivated years of Ascetic Meditation, so once his Primordial Energy did a circulation, it would circulate in the Ascetic Meditation’s trajectory. However, this time, the Primordial Energy’s trajectory followed a strange path that Zhou Wen had never seen before. It nearly coursed through his entire body in constant circulation.</p>
<p>Based on what Zhou Wen knew, any kind of Primordial Energy Art had a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>For example, Ascetic Meditation’s beginning point was in the dantian’s sea of energy. When the Primordial Energy flowed out of it, it would follow his meridians and ultimately return to the sea of energy after completing one circulation. The sea of energy was the reservoir of Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Most Primordial Energy Arts were the same. Certain special Primordial Energy Arts would forge an extremely special sea of energy in particular regions, or multiple ones. However, they were ultimately meant as a reservoir for Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen’s physical situation was a little odd. The Primordial Energy in his body kept flowing repeatedly without stopping. There wasn’t anywhere he could store his Primordial Energy or for it to stop. It was like a perpetually moving train on a circular track.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed as he attempted to circulate Ascetic Meditation to redirect the out-of-control Primordial Energy back to a proper trajectory. However, he quickly realized that the Ascetic Meditation he had been cultivating for years was helpless. The Primordial Energy didn’t listen to his instructions.</p>
<p>He didn’t panic as a result. He carefully sensed the trajectory of his Primordial Energy circulation and quickly discovered that the trajectory followed the Lost Immortal Sutra’s circulation trajectory.</p>
<p>Eh, I actually still remember the Lost Immortal Sutra? Zhou Wen was somewhat taken aback when he thought of the Lost Immortal Sutra. After all, he had been thinking about other things, but at this moment, he still remembered it clearly. He could recall each and every word of the entire Lost Immortal Sutra. There weren’t any signs of forgetting them as he had previously.</p>
<p>If the narrow-minded Jing Daoxian were to know that Zhou Wen hadn’t died from reading the Lost Immortal Sutra in its entirety, to the point of gaining a basic mastery of it, he would probably throw up blood in anger.</p>
<p>Unable to stop his Primordial Energy from circulating, Zhou Wen could only take the risk to cultivate in the Lost Immortal Sutra. Once he tried, he felt his Primordial Energy immediately course in delight, answering to the call of the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>He originally intended to read the Lost Immortal Sutra’s content once, but to his surprise, he actually ended up mastering it after he had finished reading. He had no idea if it was a boon or bane for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered a cultivation state without realizing that the thirteen violet metal sheets had gradually turned to dust and vanished when he began cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>After cultivating it, he found several points of interest. It really didn’t have a concept of a sea of energy. His Primordial Energy would constantly circulate around his body unceasingly, like the blood that coursed through his veins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s circulation of the Lost Immortal Sutra allowed him to control the speed of the Primordial Energy flow, but he wasn’t able to completely stop it.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra, his Primordial Energy would continue circulating slowly, following the Lost Immortal Sutra’s pathways.</p>
<p>With the circulation of the Lost Immortal Sutra, Zhou Wen felt his entire body abruptly become light. It felt as though his body had its shackles unlocked, giving him an indescribable sense of freedom and comfort.</p>
<p>But other than that, there was nothing special. He hadn’t advanced to the Legendary stage and it was still slowly circulating.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that he didn’t need to deliberately cultivate in the Lost Immortal Sutra. When he opened his eyes to move about, he found that the Primordial Energy would continue to circulate automatically. His actions didn’t influence it at all.</p>
<p>I have to cultivate even if I don’t wish to. Zhou Wen sighed secretly.</p>
<p>Without needing to deliberately cultivate Lost Immortal Sutra and with nothing else to do, Zhou Wen picked up the mysterious phone and used the hidden needle in his ring to stab his finger, dripping a drop of blood onto the phone’s screen.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter the game dungeons. He first took a look at his stats in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Age: 16 years</p>
<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 10</p>
<p>Speed: 10</p>
<p>Constitution: 10</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 10</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Art: Lost Immortal Sutra</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist, Skeleton Palm</p>
<p>Companion Beast: Mutated Vigor Ant (Mortal)</p>
<h3 id='chapter34'>Chapter 34: Murmuring</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. He hadn’t advanced to the Legendary stage, but all his stats had risen by 1 point, from 9 to 10.</p>
<p>This increment of one point left Zhou Wen somewhat amazed. This was because 9 seemed to be the limits of the Mortal stage. If one didn’t advance to the Legendary stage, absorbing dimensional crystals with values of 10 or more was useless.</p>
<p>This had already been proven when he absorbed the 13-valued Speed Crystal. However, the appearance of the Lost Immortal Sutra had broken that limitation.</p>
<p>What kind of Primordial Energy Art is Lost Immortal Sutra? The moment he thought of it, he realized that the thirteen violet metallic sheets had vanished at some point in time.</p>
<p>Beside him, Li Xuan was still in cultivation while the driver ahead was isolated from them by a transparent bullet-proof glass. It was impossible for them to have taken the Lost Immortal Sutra away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched everywhere for the Lost Immortal Sutra’s violet metallic sheets to no avail.</p>
<p>How odd. Zhou Wen frowned slightly, unsure if the loss of the Lost Immortal Sutra was a good or bad thing.</p>
<p>But since he couldn’t find it, Zhou Wen didn’t force it. Seeing Li Xuan still cultivating his Invincible Connate Divine Art, he raised his phone and began gaming. However, killing ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants were of little meaning. He quit the game after playing for a while, leaning into his seat and sleeping.</p>
<p>If the typical person wanted to sleep, it wasn’t something that could happen at will. However, Zhou Wen was different. If he wished to sleep, he could quickly fall asleep anytime, anywhere. Even if perilous situations were all around him, he could still fall asleep.</p>
<p>This was a type of talent that not everyone was capable of.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen decided to sleep now was to figure out if he would still suffer from sleep paralysis after mastering Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Badump! Badump!</p>
<p>Shortly after he fell asleep, Zhou Wen felt his heart race again. He felt stifled in the chest as though something was pressing down on him.</p>
<p>Damn it, here it comes again! Zhou Wen was stumped. He had already cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra, but the anomaly of sleep paralysis remained.</p>
<p>Not only had it not been removed, but it had appeared to have worsened. Zhou Wen could vaguely hear strange murmurings by his ears. They didn’t sound like they came from the mortal world, appearing in an oxymoronic manner of being extremely far and extremely near. He couldn’t figure out what was being said as they sounded like the ravings of devils in hell.</p>
<p>In this turbid half-sleep state, Zhou Wen snapped awake from the abnormal state of sleep paralysis only when Li Xuan nudged him awake.</p>
<p>However, unlike the last two instances of sleep paralysis, Zhou Wen didn’t have the discomfort of having the urge to vomit. He had only broken out into a cold sweat. He felt refreshed when the wind blew on him, giving him a better state of mind.</p>
<p>“Sunset College follows the management model of a partially-restricted state. After we matriculate, we will have to stay in dorms. Even I’m no exception. Before that, why don’t you stay at my place?” Li Xuan got out of the car and took Zhou Wen to a villa.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, due to Luoyang being rich in pan-dimensional resources, it quickly became a first-tier city of the League’s East District. This area was also the most flourishing area in the city, so every spot was worth its weight in gold. People who could live in such villas were both rich and noble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised that Li Xuan could live in a place like this. What left him surprised that apart from Li Xuan’s driver, this massive villa didn’t have a single servant.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you clean such a huge place alone?” Zhou Wen asked while sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p>“There were a few servants in the past, but I managed to get rid of them. After all, I don’t want outsiders to know of certain matters.” Li Xuan took out a beverage can from the refrigerator and threw it at Zhou Wen. He then continued with a smile, “Besides, I seldom return here. As a profligate scion, I naturally have to spend my nights out. That matches my persona. As for you, feel free to stay here. After school begins, I’ll think of a way to get the school to assign us the same dorm.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t there any single-person dorms in school?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had been used to living alone from a young age. Besides, he needed to game, so it would be better if he lived alone.</p>
<p>“No. The League has always been thinking up means to nurture our teamwork. Be it in the combat test of having four people a team or the team assignments during university, it’s all built on this premise. It’s especially so for Sunset College which has a military background. The management style is also partially militaristic. It’s impossible to get a single room. Even An Jing has to live in a group dorm,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“An Jing has also entered Sunset College?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Definitely. Her elder brother is Overseer An Tianzuo, one of the military brass. She definitely will attend Sunset College which has a militaristic background.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen with a cheeky smile. “Bro, tell me. How the hell did you offend An Jing? She even especially transferred to Guide High School to beat you up. An Jing would never have done something like that in the past.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought and asked Li Xuan, “Do you know Ouyang Lan?”</p>
<p>“Of course, if one doesn’t know Ouyang Lan in a place like Luoyang, they would have lived here for nothing,” Li Xuan said with a smile. “Don’t tell me you offended Ouyang Lan? Then you are truly unlucky. It’s no wonder An Jing came over to beat you up.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. “I didn’t offend Ouyang Lan.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you mention her?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen, baffled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked again, “Has something happened to Ouyang Lan recently?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Who in Luoyang City doesn’t know that Ouyang Lan has remarried? However, there wasn’t any grand wedding. Only a few close relatives and friends were invited for a gathering. Outsiders don’t even know what kind of man Ouyang Lan has married. I heard it’s a translator with the surname Zhou…” Having said that, Li Xuan’s eyes widened. He looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Your surname is Zhou as well… Don’t tell me that there’s some relationship between the two of you?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head without a word. Li Xuan felt his curiosity itching at him but was helpless with Zhou Wen refusing to speak.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen took up residence in Li Xuan’s place, he went to his room and immediately called Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng was his father, not his son. It wasn’t his prerogative to question Zhou Lingfeng’s decisions. Therefore, Zhou Wen had never delved deep into his thoughts before.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Lingfeng had never overturned Zhou Wen’s decisions. He hadn’t even participated or given his advice on something as major as attending university. This had seemingly become something tacit between the father-son duo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen called Zhou Lingfeng to inform him that he was in Luoyang and would be attending school at Sunset College.</p>
<p>“Son, you’re done with the college entrance exam? How did you do?” Zhou Lingfeng’s voice sounded over the phone, sounding lethargic.</p>
<p>“Not bad. I applied for Sunset College. If nothing surprising crops up, I’ll be attending school at Sunset College in the future,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Sunset College? Isn’t that in Luoyang? Come over and live with me then,” Zhou Lingfeng said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to. I’ll be staying at a friend’s place for the time being. I’ll be living on-campus once I matriculate.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to have any ties with the An family.</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng didn’t force him. “Alright then. If there’s anything, just tell me. I’ll make sure to help you. You are already in college, so you aren’t young anymore. I’ll give you a bit more living allowance in the future.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t reject it but asked, “Dad, where do you obtain the Sun Strafe Art from?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter35'>Chapter 35: Ashen Palm</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What Sun Strafe Art?” Zhou Lingfeng asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you get An Jing to send me the Sun Strafe Art?” Zhou Wen was also taken aback.</p>
<p>“It’s not like you don’t know that I have zero interest in cultivation. I don’t know much about such matters,” Zhou Lingfeng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell silent in thought. If the Sun Strafe Art wasn’t given to him by Zhou Lingfeng, then why did An Jing claim that it was given by Zhou Lingfeng? Matters had seemed to become somewhat complicated.</p>
<p>What is An Jing up to? Is the Sun Strafe Art real or fake? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to figure things out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no means to figure out the authenticity of the Sun Strafe Art. The average person had no means of coming into contact with the Sun Strafe Art, so it was even more impossible to determine its authenticity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhou Lingfeng continued, “If it was given by Little Jing, it might be some well-meant. Just keep it for now. I’ll ask her when I meet her again.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t continue. Zhou Lingfeng’s impression of the An family siblings seemed pretty good, so it was pointless to say anything else until he figured out the truth.</p>
<p>Everyone had their independent thought processes. It was impossible to force someone to view things from your own point of view, even the person closest to you. Only reality had convincing power. Zhou Wen had understood this reason from a young age.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen composed himself. He didn’t game but instead began practicing his palm techniques.</p>
<p>He had tried many times but had failed to use the force-exerting principles of Inch Punch on Vigor Divine Fist. Therefore, he went for second best in a bid to fuse Skeleton Palm and Inch Punch together as a reference.</p>
<p>With complete focus, he used the techniques of Inch Punch when delivering Skeleton Palm.</p>
<p>Skeleton Palm’s uniqueness was indeed compatible with Inch Punch. This process was a lot smoother than Zhou Wen imagined. The first few palm strikes were somewhat rough as he failed to fuse the two together correctly.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t take long for Zhou Wen to grasp the trick. The fusion of the two attacks became increasingly better.</p>
<p>After striking out about ten times, Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy was completely drained. All he could do was go in-game to grind on Vigor Ants to use the Primordial Energy Crystals that appeared to replenish his Primordial Energy for further practice.</p>
<p>Shortly after he entered the game, Zhou Wen was astonished to discover that his Primordial Energy had already recovered a little before a Primordial Energy Crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Back when he cultivated Ascetic Meditation, it would take him about an hour to recover one Primordial Energy point. Now, only a few minutes had passed for him to recover one point of Primordial Energy. The speed at which the recovery far exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>Is this the outcome of Lost Immortal Sutra? Zhou Wen felt the Primordial Energy slowly coursing through his body as he felt some delight.</p>
<p>To achieve such Primordial Energy recovery speeds at the Mortal stage was unprecedented according to what Zhou Wen knew.</p>
<p>Ignoring whether the Lost Immortal Sutra had any other uses or not, just this one trait alone was sufficiently shocking.</p>
<p>While grinding in-game with the blood-colored avatar, the mysterious phone was purely controlled by a touch-screen. However, the control of the blood-colored avatar didn’t require any contact with the screen. Most of the time, just thinking was enough to control it. There was some psychic connection between the two.</p>
<p>Thoughts and feelings were synchronized, so all the battle experience the blood-colored avatar received in-game was shared with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon seeing a Mutated Vigor Ant crawl over, Zhou Wen controlled his phone’s angle and used his thoughts to control the blood-colored avatar. He wanted to attempt to see if he could fuse Skeleton Palm and Inch Punch together.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar struck the Mutated Vigor Ant on the head with its palm, the carapace on the Mutated Vigor Ant’s head remained undamaged. However, after lunging forward a few steps, the Mutated Vigor Ant staggered before collapsing onto the ground.</p>
<p>On the left corner of the phone’s screen: Killed Mortal Mutated Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>The first line wasn’t of anything to take note of since Zhou Wen had seen it countless times. Besides, this Mutated Vigor Ant hadn’t dropped anything.</p>
<p>It was the second line that left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“Acquired Skeleton Palm’s high-level skill. Skeleton Palm has evolved into Ashen Palm.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the blood-colored avatar’s stats and found that the Skeleton Palm in the Primordial Energy Skill row had vanished. Replacing it was a Primordial Energy Skill known as Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 9)</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Ashen Palm (Rank 10)</p>
<p>Rank 10? Wasn’t Skeleton Palm a Rank 1 Primordial Energy Skill? How did it become Rank 10 after it evolved into Ashen Palm? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Ashen Palm at Rank 10 required expending 5 Primordial Energy points with each use. Its cost was the same as the Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist.</p>
<p>From the Primordial Energy cost, a Rank 10 Ashen Palm likely has the same potency as a Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist. Zhou Wen had the intention to test the potency of Ashen Palm, but ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants were unable to withstand this single strike. It didn’t matter if it was Rank 1 or Rank 9.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to leave the Ant Nest dungeon and switch to entering the Ancient Imperial City dungeon.</p>
<p>As long as the blood-colored avatar didn’t die, leaving a dungeon and re-entering or switching dungeons didn’t require him to waste blood.</p>
<p>However, if the blood-colored avatar didn’t die, the game dungeons wouldn’t refresh, so the creatures in the dungeons wouldn’t be refreshed either.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar had previously died in the Ant Nest, so after entering Ancient Imperial City, the dimensional creatures in Ancient Imperial City had already reappeared. The blood-colored avatar rode the Mutated Vigor Ant as it stormed ahead and soon found the newly spawned Skeleton General.</p>
<p>Like previously, he made the blood-colored avatar jump off the Mutated Vigor Ant and charge at the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>Using his positioning techniques to circle around the skeleton horse, it took him less than twenty minutes to find an opportunity. He got the blood-colored avatar to leap up and ride on the skeleton horse’s back, sitting right behind the Skeleton General.</p>
<p>However, this time, Zhou Wen didn’t get the blood-colored avatar to strike the Skeleton General’s weakness—the eye sockets. Instead, he directly struck at the back of the Skeleton General’s skull with his palm.</p>
<p>This palm didn’t injure the Skeleton General’s head at all. However, the blood-colored flames in the skull seemed to splatter out like a crushed watermelon.</p>
<p>Due to the momentum of the strike, the Skeleton General lunged forward on the skeleton horse before his bones scattered, turning into a pile on the ground.</p>
<p>“Killed Legendary Skeleton General. Discovered Skeleton General dimensional crystal.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the dimensional crystal that had dropped in-game, feeling a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Ashen Palm could destroy the Skeleton General even without striking its weakness. Its potency was clearly above the Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist.</p>
<p>A Rank 10 Primordial Energy Skill is indeed powerful. I wonder if Ashen Palm has a chance of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Zhou Wen had the urge to immediately storm to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to give it a try.</p>
<p>Vigor Divine Fist was too slow when it came to throwing a punch, preventing him from touching the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, Ashen Palm didn’t have such a weakness. It was extremely fast when delivering a palm strike.</p>
<h3 id='chapter36'>Chapter 36: Making up the Numbers</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The blood-colored avatar picked up the Skeleton General’s crystal and immediately, a potent Primordial Energy surged into Zhou Wen’s body like a boring drill that opened up a brand new path.</p>
<p>After this force slowly disappeared, a notification popped up on the game screen: Absorbed Skeleton General Crystal. Learned Legendary Primordial Energy Skill—Penetrating Pierce.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already been prepared to suffer damage, but he was surprised that everything had happened rather smoothly.</p>
<p>With a Mortal stage body, one could only fuse with Mortal Primordial Energy Skill Crystals under normal circumstances. If one forcefully fused a Legendary Primordial Energy Skill, their bodies would suffer an immense impact. The consequences ranged from damaged meridians to instant death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had relied on his body being far stronger than the typical Mortal stage, and with no fear of death in-game, this gave him the courage to absorb the Skeleton General Crystal. Everything went smoothly and other than the pain of having a Primordial Energy passageway open up in him, there wasn’t any damage dealt to him.</p>
<p>“Is this the case when played in-game or is this an effect of Lost Immortal Sutra?” Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure of the reason, but ultimately, it was a boon for him.</p>
<p>After glancing at the provided information in-game, Penetrating Pierce was a Rank 1 Legendary Primordial Energy Skill. However, Penetrating Pierce was a Primordial Energy Skill that required a spear-type weapon to deliver maximum force.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, come out here!” Zhou Wen was planning on switching dungeons to try his chances at killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in Ant Nest when he heard a woman’s voice sound at the villa’s entrance. At the same time, the doorbell kept ringing.</p>
<p>Li Xuan probably wasn’t home and he was the only one inside.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen heard the doorbell, the visitor had come for Li Xuan. Since the latter wasn’t home, he didn’t have any intention of opening the door. He continued gaming while sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, I know you’re home. If you don’t come on out, don’t blame me!” After pressing the doorbell for quite some time, the woman still refused to give up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen completely ignored her and pretended not to hear her shouts. The doorbell’s ringing didn’t disturb him in any way, so he continued gaming.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that the woman would leave quickly, but to his surprise, the woman stopped after yelling for a while. Then, two seconds later, there was a loud bang followed by two thuds. The door had been kicked open!</p>
<p>The woman dashed into the villa and saw no one in the living room, so she headed straight upstairs.</p>
<p>She appeared to be very familiar with the place, rushing straight for Li Xuan’s room. Without knocking, she kicked the door open.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, there’s no hiding today!” Seeing the room empty, the woman headed down the corridor and kicked open one room after another.</p>
<p>When she reached the second room, she saw Zhou Wen gaming while leaning on the bedhead.</p>
<p>Seeing a person, the woman was delighted. However, she immediately wore a look of disappointment when she realized that it wasn’t Li Xuan. She glared at Zhou Wen and asked, “What’s wrong with you? Didn’t you hear me screaming?”</p>
<p>“I did,” Zhou Wen answered as he gamed, not even looking up at the woman.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you answer when you heard me?” the woman said, peeved.</p>
<p>“You were looking for Li Xuan, not me. What should I say?” Zhou Wen answered in passing.</p>
<p>The woman was instantly at a loss for a rejoinder. She glared at Zhou Wen fiercely and asked, “Where’s Li Xuan?”</p>
<p>“He’s out.”</p>
<p>“I know that he’s out. I’m asking you where he is.” The woman didn’t feel that there was any need to be polite in front of this fellow.</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea,” Zhou Wen answered very succinctly because he really had no idea.</p>
<p>Just as the woman was about to say something, her phone rang. She picked up the call, said a few words, and prepared to turn to leave as though there was something pressing.</p>
<p>But after taking a few steps, the woman seemed to think of something. She rushed back in front of Zhou Wen and yanked him up by the arm. “Follow me. Count it as helping me. At the very least, you can make up the numbers.”</p>
<p>“Who are you? I don’t know you.” Zhou Wen frowned slightly, wishing to free himself from the woman’s grasp.</p>
<p>“For you to stay here, you must be one of Li Xuan’s trashy friends. How can you not even know his elder sister? You enjoy life with Li Xuan all thanks to him. Is there a problem helping his sister with something?” The woman seemed anxious, pulling Zhou Wen as she walked out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. He wasn’t a trashy friend as she described, but it was true that he was living at Li Xuan’s place at his expense.</p>
<p>“Let me go. I can walk on my own. What help do you need from me?” Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that if it wasn’t anything serious, he could always help as payment for rent.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t loosen her grip upon hearing that. She continued speaking as she walked. “Don’t worry. I’m only getting you to make up the numbers. I don’t have any hopes of you doing anything. Just don’t screw things up.”</p>
<p>Without even knowing the name of Li Xuan’s sister, he was pulled out of the villa.</p>
<p>A motorbike was parked at the villa’s entrance. After throwing the helmet that hung on the handle to Zhou Wen, she got on and said, “Come on up.”</p>
<p>When he saw her tall figure in a pair of short boots, t-shirt, and jeans, with black curly hair freely cascading down, he found a heroic vibe to her. She was very different from the women Zhou Wen had previously met.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any other thoughts about it. After putting on the helmet, he sat behind Li Xuan’s sister.</p>
<p>“Sit tight.” As there was only one helmet, the woman naturally didn’t have one to wear after giving it to Zhou Wen. When the engine roared to life, her curly hair began flailing in the wind, sweeping across Zhou Wen from time to time.</p>
<p>On the streets of Luoyang, one could occasionally see experts riding all kinds of dimensional creatures. In contrast, this was rarely seen in Guide City.</p>
<p>Vehicles and Companion Beasts followed their own paths looking somewhat bizarre and harmonious.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts were taking on an increasingly important role in the League. Work that many humans and machines were unable to complete required the help of Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>With powerful Companion Beasts, not only did it strengthen oneself, but it could also provide service to all of humanity.</p>
<p>The woman drove extremely fast, swerving through traffic in a harrowing manner. However, she was surprisingly stable, without showing any signs of emergency braking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat behind her, with his hands still on his phone gaming. The journey didn’t affect his ability to game.</p>
<p>After riding for quite a while, Li Xuan’s sister—Li Weiyang—impression of Zhou Wen improved after not feeling any hands placed around her waist.</p>
<p>She had never had a good impression of Li Xuan’s bad company. If she wasn’t in a rush to get Zhou Wen to make up the numbers, she wouldn’t have brought him along. She originally had imagined that Zhou Wen would hug her waist to take advantage of her while riding on the bike, but none of that happened. Even his body hadn’t made any contact with her, as though he was deliberately keeping a distance.</p>
<p>I never expected Li Xuan’s friends to show some manners, Li Weiyang thought as she subconsciously looked back at Zhou Wen. It would have been fine if she hadn’t looked back, but with that one look, all her favorable impression was gone.</p>
<p>She originally imagined that Zhou Wen was being a gentleman, but when she looked back, she realized that Zhou Wen was still gaming on his phone, having the time of his life. From the way he was engrossed in it, it looked as though he wished to be in the game itself.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I was overthinking things. How could any of Li Xuan’s friends be a gentleman? Li Weiyang thought to herself in a self-deprecating manner.</p>
<h3 id='chapter37'>Chapter 37: Vying for the Companion Egg</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Li Weiyang stopped inside a Companion Beast Arena with Zhou Wen. A few girls who had been waiting outside rushed over and began breaking out into a cacophony.</p>
<p>After listening for a while, Zhou Wen had a rough idea of what was happening.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang and the few girls were students of Sunset College. They were his future seniors.</p>
<p>These girls and another girl had entered a dimensional zone to slay dimensional creatures and were lucky enough to have a Mortal Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>It was an Ancient War Steed Companion Egg. Furthermore, it had apparently dropped from a Mutated Ancient War Steed.</p>
<p>Mortal Companion Eggs were rare to begin with, so to have one drop was a really lucky event. Furthermore, it had dropped from a Mutated Ancient War Steed. This meant that its stats would be extremely high, making it priceless.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts of the same level varied drastically in terms of stats. Mortal Companion Beasts’ four main basic stats typically varied between 1–9. As for Legendary Companion Beasts, their basic stats varied between 10–18.</p>
<p>The importance of basic stats was obvious. The higher the stats, the more powerful their innate abilities were. After becoming a Companion Beast, the augmentation they provided their owners was boosted as well.</p>
<p>Mutated Ancient War Steeds were top-notch when it came to Strength and Speed at the Mortal stage; therefore, they definitely weren’t inferior in Companion Beast form. To be able to drop such a Companion Egg was definitely a great thing to happen.</p>
<p>However, the owner of the Companion Egg became the reason for the strife.</p>
<p>As a team, they should have split the spoils of war equally, but the girl who had obtained the Mutated Ancient War Steed Companion Egg claimed that she was the one responsible for killing the Mutated Ancient War Steed and digging out the Companion Egg. Therefore, she should have sole possession of it.</p>
<p>The other girls naturally disagreed. However, the girl, Su Mei, forcefully snatched the Companion Egg thanks to her boyfriend being quite a force to be reckoned with in school. She didn’t even intend to provide any compensation.</p>
<p>The girls were infuriated and as one of them had a close relationship with Li Weiyang, she got her to stand up for them.</p>
<p>After Li Weiyang had heard of the ins and outs, she originally intended to mediate the situation and get both parties to compromise. Su Mei could take the Companion Egg, but she needed to compensate the rest.</p>
<p>But to her surprise, Su Mei wouldn’t compromise at all thanks to her boyfriend’s standing. The situation became worse as both sides decided to battle at the Companion Beast Arena. The winner would then be able to take the Mutated Ancient War Steed away.</p>
<p>Su Mei’s boyfriend was a senior student at Sunset College named Gao Yang. Li Weiyang also knew him and how strong he was. Therefore, she wanted Li Xuan here and have him bring more people to stand by them in the event Gao Yang went back on his word after losing.</p>
<p>But to her dismay, she wasn’t able to get Li Xuan on the phone. Unable to find him at home, all she could do was bring Zhou Wen along.</p>
<p>“Sis Weiyang, what do we do without Li Xuan being here?” The girls wore a look of worry.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan had just been admitted into Sunset College, his infamy as a prodigal son of the Li family was well known in all of Luoyang. The girls were no exception.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had often seen Li Xuan visiting Li Weiyang.</p>
<p>“What’s there to be afraid of? I’m around?” Li Weiyang said.</p>
<p>“But Su Mei’s boyfriend, Gao Yang, is a fourth-year senior. I heard that he’s very…” a girl said, trembling.</p>
<p>“So what if he’s a fourth-year? He’s still at the Mortal stage. I have confidence in beating him and getting back the Companion Egg,” Li Weiyang said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd. Since Li Weiyang was Li Xuan’s sister, it meant that she was the eldest daughter of the Li family. Why wasn’t she able to settle such a trivial matter, to the point of having to settle it with a battle at the Companion Beast Arena?</p>
<p>He was automatically ignored by the girls because although he had a good build, he looked pale due to his loss of blood. He looked sickly and looked incapable of fighting.</p>
<p>After entering the arena, they came to a ring. From afar, there was a group of young men and women. Not only were their numbers far greater than Li Weiyang’s side, but they were also mostly stoutly men.</p>
<p>Leading them was a tall and handsome man who was hugging a girl’s waist by the side of the spectator stand. Upon seeing Li Weiyang walk over, he said with a laugh, “Li Weiyang, you actually have the guts to come?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Defeating you won’t be difficult. I’ll definitely get back the Companion Egg,” Li Weiyang said.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of your capability, but you are no way my match. Besides, I’m a fourth-year senior. It’s really not nice bullying a junior like you,” Gao Yang said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Gao Yang, what are you getting at?” Li Weiyang had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“I never bully others, so I’ve deliberately found a second-year junior like the rest of you. As long as anyone of you can defeat him, I’ll return the Companion Egg on a golden plate. Of course, it needs to be a student at Sunset College. Outsiders don’t count,” Gao Yang said as he clapped his hands.</p>
<p>On a seat on the spectator stand behind Gao Yang, a figure stood up.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian!” When Li Weiyang and the other girls saw the figure, the color in their faces drained. The more timid one nearly burst into tears out of fear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also alarmed as he stood by the side and sized up the man.</p>
<p>He had never seen a person look this fierce all his life.</p>
<p>Ugly and fierce-looking were two completely different concepts. This person didn’t look ugly, but he exuded vibes like a devil that left one shuddering. Timid people would probably be frightened to death if they met him in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never believed that looks alone could frighten someone to death. However, Gu Dian really left chills running through one’s heart, making one not dare look at him straight.</p>
<p>“Gao Yang, how despicable of you. You actually got Gu Dian to represent you. How much of a sore loser are you?” Li Weiyang said with an ugly expression.</p>
<p>Although she was very confident in her strength, Gu Dian was no ordinary student.</p>
<p>Gu Dian was nicknamed The Devil at school. Not only was it because of his muscular body, that stood more than two meters tall, or his fierce, devilish looks, but that he had unfathomable strength. His abnormal strength made him nearly invincible among those at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Gu Dian was probably the first and only person to beat up a senior on the first day he was admitted into Sunset College.</p>
<p>Although Li Weiyang had never fought Gu Dian, the latter had once pummeled a fourth-year senior whose strength almost equaled her with a few punches. Li Weiyang knew that her chances of victory against Gu Dian weren’t high.</p>
<p>Su Mei, who remained leaning on Gao Yang, mocked, “Li Weiyang, there’s something wrong with what you say. Gao Yang got a second-year because he just doesn’t want to bully a junior like you. So how can you say something like that? Besides, didn’t we already agree that the battle shouldn’t involve any outsiders? Only students from our school can participate in the battle. Isn’t Gu Dian a student of our Sunset College? If you think your strength is lacking, you are free to get help. We aren’t stopping you.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter38'>Chapter 38: Are We Continuing?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Li Weiyang was rendered speechless. It wasn’t that there weren’t any students that were stronger than Gu Dian in Sunset College. Those that ranked in the top twenty in the school’s internal examinations were basically at the Legendary stage. They were naturally stronger than Gu Dian.</p>
<p>However, Li Weiyang didn’t have any close ties with those seniors. They weren’t necessarily going to provide their help without any reason if she recruited them. Furthermore, with the battle about to begin, it was too late.</p>
<p>Gao Yang and Su Mei had never mentioned letting Gu Dian fight. Clearly, by letting him step forward now, it was to prevent Li Weiyang and company from having the time to find more reinforcements.</p>
<p>“Sis Weiyang, what do we do now?” A girl looked at Li Weiyang worriedly.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang clenched her teeth. “At this juncture, I can only try my best.”</p>
<p>“Sis Weiyang, perhaps we should just forget it. We don’t want the Companion Egg. Gu Dian is so terrifying. It won’t be good if he flares up and injures you,” a girl said.</p>
<p>Although the girls were somewhat unwilling, they persuaded her to relent.</p>
<p>“We can’t let those two f*ckers, Gao Yang and Su Mei, walk off with all the benefits.” Li Weiyang just couldn’t let it go seeing Gao Yang’s and Su Mei’s smug looks.</p>
<p>After taking off her denim jacket and throwing it to a girl, Li Weiyang walked over to the ring with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>The fighting ring of the Companion Beast Arena was actually meant for Companion Beasts. This was because combat had many indeterminable factors and was extremely dangerous. Therefore, the League didn’t promote private battles.</p>
<p>However, battles between Companion Beasts were greatly encouraged. Every city had numerous Companion Beast Arenas—facilities that allowed human experts with Companion Beasts to use their companions for battle.</p>
<p>Companion Beast competitions had already become a huge industry in the League. Many humans with powerful Companion Beasts had become celebrities with an influence that far exceeded those entertainment celebrities of yesteryear.</p>
<p>After all, having strong companions meant powerful strength for themselves. They were genuinely the best among humanity.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t pay too much attention to Companion Beast competitions, he also knew several Companion Beast celebrities due to the advertisements that were everywhere.</p>
<p>For example, the number one Companion Beast in the world was the Epic stage Verbis Diablo Holy Angel that was known by all. The person who owned her had naturally become a top celebrity.</p>
<p>Of course, this ranking of first place only included those who participated in Companion Beast competitions. There were definitely powerful Companion Beasts who had never participated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard that when Legendary experts went on expeditions in the dimensional zones, they would mostly fight with their Companion Beasts. Unless necessary, no one wished to engage the battle in person. After all, they only had one life. The death of a Companion Beast wasn’t the end, but it wasn’t the same for humans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person could control multiple Companion Beasts. This made them far stronger than fighting alone.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang got into the fighting ring and stood opposite Gu Dian. Although Li Weiyang stood at 1.7 meters, making her rather tall among girls, she appeared petite in front of Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian, can you not intervene?” Li Weiyang glared at Gu Dian and asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Gu Dian answered very directly without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang wasn’t one to drag things out. Without a word, her long legs produced terrifying strength, appearing in front of Gu Dian in a few steps. She leaped up and exerted immense strength with a twist of her waist, throwing out a kick. It struck out like a bolt of lightning, hitting Gu Dian in the neck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded secretly. Li Weiyang was indeed pretty good, far stronger than Xu Miantu. Furthermore, her kick was clearly a Primordial Energy Skill. That strike alone was enough to snap a human-sized tree.</p>
<p>However, Gu Dian didn’t react, despite being hit by such a kick, allowing Li Weiyang to cleave down at his neck with her long blade-like leg.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>There was a loud thud and everyone was alarmed. Gu Dian remained standing there, having received Li Weiyang’s strike. Yet, his neck didn’t even move.</p>
<p>Although Gao Yang and Su Mei knew that Gu Dian was strong, they never expected him to be this terrifyingly strong. Faced with Li Weiyang’s Primordial Energy Skill kick, he had taken on the blow without dodging. His body hadn’t even trembled once.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang was equally shocked, but she didn’t hesitate. Clenching her teeth, she turned her body and did a back kick, throwing out four kicks from her long, but strong, legs like a butterfly.</p>
<p>Gu Dian stood there like a tower, taking Li Weiyang’s four kicks without defending or dodging. From beginning to end, he stood there motionless without Li Weiyang injuring him at all.</p>
<p>When Li Weiyang was about to kick the fifth time, Gu Dian finally moved. His hand shot out like lightning and grabbed her leg in midair.</p>
<p>The next moment, Gu Dian held up Li Weiyang’s leg and, like throwing a sandbag, smashed Li Weiyang onto the ground.</p>
<p>With a loud thud, Li Weiyang’s body bounced half a foot in the air after hitting the ring and then fell.</p>
<p>Although the ring’s surface was covered with a special rubber material that provided powerful dampening force, it still didn’t stop Li Weiyang from spewing out a mouthful of blood. She didn’t manage to get up immediately.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian, you really don’t know how to go easy on girls. How can you treat such a beauty in this way?” Su Mei said gloatingly.</p>
<p>Gu Dian ignored her and asked Li Weiyang, who was struggling to get up, “Are we continuing?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Why not? I haven’t lost.” Li Weiyang struggled to her feet, the corners of her mouth stained with blood. Her arm had been dislocated from the throw, but she continued speaking stubbornly.</p>
<p>“Sis Weiyang, stop it. We don’t want the Companion Egg…” A girl was on the brink of tears.</p>
<p>However, Gu Dian didn’t care. Just as Li Weiyang made it clear that she could continue, he dashed towards her like a tank. Grabbing her by the head, he pressed her down onto the ring.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Weiyang’s face hit the ground and although the rubber surface provided some dampening, Gu Dian was just too strong. By exerting some force, he made her nose bridge and brow ridge crack. Blood began flowing everywhere.</p>
<p>“Are we continuing?” Gu Dian looked at Li Weiyang and continued asking.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang’s face was covered with blood. She propped herself up with one hand on the ground, making several bids to exert strength to stand up, the look in her eyes tenacious.</p>
<p>A timid girl was about to cry. Zhou Wen could tell that Li Weiyang would continue based on the look in her eyes.</p>
<p>Why is this woman so stubborn? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>He hadn’t had any intention of bothering with this matter, but he couldn’t bring himself to watch Li Xuan’s sister being brutally tortured having received free board and lodging from him.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment,” Zhou Wen said before Li Weiyang could even reply.</p>
<h3 id='chapter39'>Chapter 39: Porcupine Skill</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Everyone was reeling with anxiety. Even Gao Yang and Su Mei were shocked.</p>
<p>Although they had gotten Gu Dian, none of them expected him to be this ruthless. If Li Weiyang were to really suffer any serious injuries, it would only escalate the matter.</p>
<p>Although she was an illegitimate daughter of the Li family and was never allowed inside the Li family’s house, she ultimately had the Li family’s blood coursing through her veins. It would be impossible for them to ignore it if something really happened to her.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s voice sounded, it immediately provided a vent for everyone’s tense feelings. Even Li Weiyang and Gu Dian looked over at him.</p>
<p>“Schoolmate, did you say that we can enter the ring as long as we are students of Sunset College?” Zhou Wen asked Su Mei.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What do you wish to say?” Su Mei didn’t know what Zhou Wen was getting at.</p>
<p>“I’ve just been admitted into Sunset College, but I haven’t matriculated. Am I allowed to enter the ring?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>He imagined that if Su Mei said no, he could use this opportunity to pull Li Weiyang from the ring and return home early to game.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Su Mei guffawed. “So you are our Sunset College’s junior. I can’t tell that you are a man who knows how to cherish women. But as your senior, I’m giving you the chance to be the hero to rescue the damsel in distress. Go on up if you wish to, but don’t blame me for not warning you if you get injured. University and high school aren’t the same.”</p>
<p>Gao Yang and company jeered. Anyone that could be admitted into Sunset College was an elite. There were plenty that came first or second in their own cities.</p>
<p>But so what? After stepping into the college, won’t they all schooled? High school geniuses only lined the bottom at Sunset College. The ones who could really stand out were few and far between. Most ended up drowning in a sea of talent.</p>
<p>It was especially so for the top students in small cities. Most of them gradually became mediocre once they arrived at Sunset College. It wasn’t that they weren’t outstanding, but there were just too many people who were more outstanding than them.</p>
<p>Gu Dian happened to be one who stood out from his peers. For a rookie who hadn’t even been matriculated to actually dare challenge Gu Dian because of Li Weiyang was, in their opinion, blinded and driven by lust.</p>
<p>Gao Yang said with a cheeky smile, “Junior, you do resemble me from a few years ago. It’s fine. Go on up if you want to. As your senior, I’ll give you a chance to show off in front of the beauties.”</p>
<p>As he said that, he thought to himself, Gu Dian doesn’t know how to hold back. It’s definitely not good to injure Li Weiyang. So it’s good that she can be swapped.</p>
<p>The girls on Li Weiyang’s side looked at Zhou Wen worriedly. They were afraid that his sickly body would just die from a single punch from Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Senior Weiyang, let me,” Zhou Wen said as he flipped himself into the ring.</p>
<p>“Don’t mess around. Go down.” Li Weiyang had only pulled him here to add to the numbers. She had zero intention of getting him to fight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gu Dian was just too strong and he didn’t hold back. based on Zhou Wen’s sickly look, it was really possible that he could die from a single punch. As students, they might not be able to extricate themselves from his death, nor could Li Weiyang bear the responsibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to speak further. He just wished to settle this matter so that he could game in peace.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Li Weiyang to speak again, he reached out and lifted Li Weiyang up.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang’s arm was dislocated and she was heavily injured. Unable to put up any resistance, she was lifted up by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Let me go!” Li Weiyang was embarrassed and enraged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored her and directly leaped out of the ring with her. After handing her to the girls, he returned to the ring.</p>
<p>“We are students of the same school, not some archenemies. There’s no need for us to fight to the death. No one can shoulder the responsibility if an accident happens. Why don’t we change the criteria for victory?” Zhou Wen sized up Gu Dian and said.</p>
<p>“How so?” Gu Dian spoke very succinctly. His voice didn’t sound like a college student. It was low, gruff, and forceful—akin to a man in his thirties or forties.</p>
<p>Matched with his fierce looks, Zhou Wen really couldn’t believe that he was a college sophomore if it wasn’t for the Sunset College uniform he was wearing.</p>
<p>“You let me punch you once. If you take less than three steps back, count me as the loser. Otherwise, I win. What do you think of my suggestion?” Zhou Wen had only said it randomly. Clearly, this disadvantaged Gu Dian.</p>
<p>However, finding a Strength-measuring device was just too much of a waste of time. Therefore, Zhou Wen had given the suggestion.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, Gu Dian said coldly without any thought, “Sure.”</p>
<p>Somewhat surprised, Zhou Wen said with a smile, “Then let’s begin.”</p>
<p>Gao Yang curled his lips and said, “This rookie even thinks that he has taken the advantage. If he knows what Primordial Energy Skill and Primordial Energy Art Gu Dian cultivates in, he might be crying, much less laugh.”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, what Primordial Energy Skill and Primordial Energy Art does Gu Dian cultivate?” Someone beside him was intrigued.</p>
<p>“It’s not my place to mention what Primordial Energy Art he cultivates in. However, I’m sure all of you have heard his Primordial Energy Skill before.” Gao Yang deliberately acted mystifying.</p>
<p>“So what Primordial Energy Skill is it?” Su Mei couldn’t hold back her curiosity as she wheedled and nudged Gao Yang’s arm.</p>
<p>Gao Yang chuckled. “Have you heard of dimensional creatures known as Needle Porcupines?”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, are you kidding me? We’ve obviously heard of Needle Porcupines. Although they are at the Mortal stage, they are especially thorny. Not only are their carapace tough, but they are also covered with quills. Unless it’s those Legendary stage seniors, we have to circle around them,” a male schoolmate said.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian’s Primordial Energy Skill came from a Porcupine Skill from a Needle Porcupine Crystal. If he were to use it, not only will his body be as hard as steel, he will also have the ability to deal thorns1 damage,” Gao Yang said.</p>
<p>“No way. I heard that Needle Porcupines very rarely drop Primordial Energy Skills, and even if it drops, with the powers of a Needle Porcupine, it will be a Rank 1 or 2 Primordial Energy Skill. How strong can it be?” Su Mei said in disbelief.</p>
<p>“That’s why people call Gu Dian terrifying. Not only did he have exceedingly good luck to have the Porcupine Skill drop, he even managed to cultivate a Rank 1 Porcupine Skill all the way to Rank 9. Furthermore, he didn’t rely on Primordial Energy Skill Crystals to increase his rank. Isn’t that sick or what?” Gao Yang paused before sneering. “When it comes to Rank 9 Porcupine Skill, I’ve once seen a fourth-year use a Primordial Energy Skill strike Gu Dian, only to have his palm riddled with countless bloody holes as though he had been stabbed by countless steel needles. His hand was almost crippled. It’ll be fine if that rookie doesn’t use any Primordial Energy Skills, but if he does, he’s in for a bad time.”</p>
<p>Su Mei was delighted when she heard that. She naturally didn’t want Zhou Wen to win, much less hand over the Mutated Ancient War Steed Companion Egg.</p>
<h3 id='chapter40'>Chapter 40: Strength Clash</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Sis Weiyang, is he ok?” The few girls asked worriedly, as they helped Li Weiyang up.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang obviously had no idea. However, since Zhou Wen was Li Xuan’s friend and based on the kind of company the latter mixed with, the former was definitely not someone they could rely on.</p>
<p>However, Li Weiyang couldn’t say it out loud. All she could do was say something assuring. “Since he dares to enter the ring, he should be somewhat capable.”</p>
<p>Instead of saying that to assure her companions, it was more to assure herself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood in front of Gu Dian. He wasn’t short among men, but in front of Gu Dian, he was a head shorter.</p>
<p>Gu Dian’s body was extremely brawny. Not only was he tall, but his muscles were taut, exuding vibes that he had explosive strength within. There was nothing clumsy about him.</p>
<p>During Gu Dian’s battle with Li Weiyang, Zhou Wen had already noticed that the former cultivated in a high-level defensive-type Primordial Energy Skill. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to withstand the strike from a Primordial Energy Skill no matter how strong his physical body was.</p>
<p>Gu Dian glared at Zhou Wen with his cold eyes like the devil. In a chilly manner, he said, “Come. Don’t waste any more time.”</p>
<p>“You have to be careful. This punch of mine has great Strength,” Zhou Wen warned him before slowly raising his fist.</p>
<p>Su Mei was amused when she heard Zhou Wen. She said in mockery, “It’s great if you have great Strength. Gu Dian loves that. Use more of your strength, lest you disappoint him.”</p>
<p>Su Mei’s words sounded like a joke, but they hid extreme wickedness. Gu Dian’s Porcupine Skill possessed terrifying thorns damage, so the more Strength Zhou Wen used, the greater the damage he would suffer.</p>
<p>Although Gao Yang didn’t say a word, he waited to watch the spectacle.</p>
<p>Sunset College had many powerful students, but at the Mortal stage, no one was Gu Dian’s match.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t afraid of death, feel free to strike.” Gu Dian’s expression remained unperturbed, but it was already extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t speak further as he threw out his right fist, producing immense strength with Vigor Divine Fist. It caused his fist to swell up to a whole new size as though it was a hammer.</p>
<p>Gu Dian’s eyes narrowed as he stood firmly on the ground. An abnormal redness flushed through his body as though he was lit aflame.</p>
<p>Knowing that this was a trait of Porcupine Skill, Gao Yang’s smile became more obvious.</p>
<p>When Li Weiyang saw the anomaly on Gu Dian’s body, she immediately recalled something. Ignoring her injuries, she hurriedly yelled at Zhou Wen, “Don’t throw out that punch! It’s Porcupine Skill! It will rebound…”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen’s fist had struck Gu Dian’s abdomen before she could finish her sentence.</p>
<p>This was a spot Zhou Wen had deliberately chosen—it was an area that could resist relatively more impact; thus, reducing the chances of death.</p>
<p>When the hard-as-steel fist struck at firm muscles, there was a loud thud with the slightest hint of a metallic clash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s and Gu Dian’s eyes narrowed simultaneously as Gao Yang and Su Mei watched in disbelief. Gu Dian’s gargantuan body curled slightly like a shrimp as his feet slid across the ice, stopping only after he retreated nearly four meters.</p>
<p>Two nearly four-meter-long black marks appeared on the rubber surface like skid marks left by a car’s emergency braking.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang stared at Zhou Wen with a blank look, finding his strength unbelievable. He had managed to send Gu Dian retreating about four meters despite the latter using Porcupine Skill.</p>
<p>The other girls had already broken out into cheers. This wasn’t just three steps, but three to four meters! It was probably as many as eight steps!</p>
<p>“Gao Yang, can I take your word?” Zhou Wen retracted his trembling fist and asked.</p>
<p>He had sent Gu Dian retreating with one punch, but he wasn’t too good either. His fist was trembling uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Gao Yang didn’t say a word as he looked at Gu Dian who said coldly, “I’ve lost.”</p>
<p>Gao Yang nodded as he looked at Su Mei. “Give the Companion Egg to them.”</p>
<p>Su Mei immediately stood up and yelled, “What right do they have? The agreement was between them. I didn’t agree that a loss would be counted if Gu Dian retreated three steps. It’s completely unreasonable. Besides, Gu Dian’s feet didn’t even more. It can only be considered one step. Let him fight Gu Dian. If he can trounce Gu Dian, I’ll count it as his win. Besides, he isn’t a student of Sunset College yet…”</p>
<p>Smack! Before Su Mei could finish her drivel, Gao Yang slapped her in the face, leaving her stunned.</p>
<p>“Do I need to say it a second time? A loss is a loss. I, Gao Yang, never go back on my word. Do you think that a Companion Egg of yours is more important than a promise of mine?” Gao Yang glared coldly at Su Mei.</p>
<p>Su Mei was much aggrieved, but she didn’t dare say another word. Unwillingly, she took out the Companion Egg from her bag and handed it to Gao Yang with gritted teeth. Then, she turned around in anger.</p>
<p>Gao Yang ignored Su Mei and walked to Zhou Wen with the Companion Egg in hand. Throwing it to the latter, he stared at him. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen replied calmly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen? I’ll remember you. Since you will be a student of Sunset College in the future, we’ll have plenty of time to spend together soon,” Gao Yang said coldly before he turned around and left with the group of students.</p>
<p>Gu Dian glanced at Zhou Wen, but didn’t say a word. He then left, following behind Gao Yang and company.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I sure couldn’t tell that you had such Strength when you look like such a pretty boy,” Li Weiyang walked over and said as she sized him up.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you really our junior?”</p>
<p>“Are high-schoolers these days so strong?”</p>
<p>“Junior, you used a Primordial Energy Skill, right? How impressive. What is its name?”</p>
<p>The few girls circled around Zhou Wen as they asked him all kinds of questions. Their interest in him seemed to exceed the interest in the Companion Egg he had snatched back.</p>
<p>“My victory was all thanks to luck. That devil-like fellow was truly terrifying. If we had really engaged in battle, it would be hard to tell who would have won.” Zhou Wen handed the Companion Egg to Li Weiyang before raising his injured fist. There were dense, needle-like holes on the back of his hand which were beginning to ooze a tiny bit of blood.</p>
<p>“Are you injured?” Li Weiyang was alarmed when she saw the wound on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Without waiting for his reply, Li Weiyang handed the Companion Egg to the girls and got them to leave. Then, she pulled Zhou Wen outside. “Let’s go. You need to check on your injuries.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. It’s just some superficial wounds. It didn’t injure my bones,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“You need to have a check-up, otherwise it will be a problem if it leaves some side effects.” Li Weiyang dragged Zhou Wen to the medical room without listening to his protests.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast Arena had dedicated medical facilities. By the time they arrived, Zhou Wen’s wounds had already healed and produced scabs that were fine after some treatment. Instead, Li Weiyang was the heavily injured one. She had dislocated her arm and the wound on her face needed treatment. It was Zhou Wen who had to run around to do all kinds of medical paperwork for her.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang lay in bed, looking at Zhou Wen and his staid, gentle face as he ran around. With mixed feelings, she thought, I never expected Li Xuan to have such a friend.</p>
<h3 id='chapter41'>Chapter 41: Companion Beast Fusion</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>It was quite an ordeal for Zhou Wen to finally return home and be able to game in peace. But just as he sat on the sofa and launched the game dungeon, Li Xuan rushed home.</p>
<p>“Your door was kicked down by a woman who claimed to be your sister. Her name is Li Weiyang,” Zhou Wen immediately made things clear, afraid that Li Xuan would blame him for damaging his villa.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan didn’t heed that at all. In excitement, he asked Zhou Wen in a mysterious manner, “Are you interested in visiting the dimensional zone I previously mentioned?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the dimensional zone that produces organ-type Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Bingo. Are you interested?”</p>
<p>“But we haven’t matriculated! Can we enter now?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan suspiciously.</p>
<p>“The average person obviously can’t, but I’m no average person,” Li Xuan said as he languidly slapped his chest.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s head over.” Zhou Wen was quite intrigued, but it wasn’t that he wanted to enter a dimensional zone. Instead, he wanted to know if the dimensional zone could be installed on his phone just like Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>“Bro, can you show me some excitement? I really can’t feel a sense of achievement with that face of yours,” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Wow! You’re awesome!” Zhou Wen cried out in a very perfunctory manner as he continued gaming on his phone without looking up.</p>
<p>“Forget it.” Li Xuan became even more depressed. However, he cheered up almost immediately. Pulling Zhou Wen out, he said, “Pal, I’ll be broadening your horizon today.”</p>
<p>When they arrived in the yard, Zhou Wen saw a white tiger sprawled outside the villa. It was even bigger and muscular than an ox.</p>
<p>“Legendary Jade-Eyed White Tiger. How cool is that? I incubated it just today. It was such a harrowing experience…” Li Xuan bragged as his saliva splattered about.</p>
<p>“With such flaunting, you have no plans on acting any further, right?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s face sank. “In the past, I wished that things wouldn’t turn nasty among the family, so I didn’t compete with him. Since he doesn’t even want to spare my life, there’s no need for me to stand on ceremony with him. From now on, I’ll become the Li family’s genius, Li Xuan. What should be mine will be mine, nothing less.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave Li Xuan the thumbs up. Indeed, a genius like Li Xuan didn’t deserve to be hidden. However, he was curious. Li Xuan cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, so was he to stay a virgin his entire life if he continued cultivating in it?</p>
<p>“Let’s not touch on such matters. Come on up. Let’s go a joyride. This Jade-Eyed White Tiger is extraordinary. If I use enough resources on it, it has a chance of advancing to an Epic King of White Tigers. That would make it truly terrifying,” Li Xuan said as he jumped onto its back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that certain Companion Beasts could evolve, but they were in the minority. Furthermore, evolution required special dimensional materials and very strict criteria.</p>
<p>Currently, the League was doing research in this respect. There were less than four hundred on the official list of evolvable Companion Beasts. The rest were still being studied.</p>
<p>Riding on a Companion Beast didn’t feel good in any way. The trembling was intense due to the lack of a suspension. Zhou Wen would rather ride in a comfortable sedan car.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan was thrilled. He dashed down the road riding the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, whistling and waving to beauties he passed on the street.</p>
<p>This fellow’s foppish character sure doesn’t appear to be an act. Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a problem. He whispered into the Legendary stage’s ear, “Li Xuan, what are the criteria needed to incubate a Legendary Companion Egg for those at the Mortal stage?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “You wish to incubate that Skeleton General, right? I’m warning you not to mess around. Don’t try it just because it seems it’s easy for me to incubate one. Let me tell you seriously that people with such thoughts mostly end up either crippled or dead.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Li Xuan said smugly, “To incubate a Companion Egg, the most important criteria is to have sufficient Primordial Energy. A typical Legendary Companion Egg needs more than ten Primordial Energy to incubate it. The typical human at the Mortal stage doesn’t have that much Primordial Energy. After being sucked dry of their Primordial Energy, one’s vitality and essence would be drawn in place of Primordial Energy. When that happens, it’s either death or disability. The reason I can incubate a Legendary Companion Egg is because my Invincible Connate Divine Art has cultivated to 9 points of Primordial Energy. Furthermore, I have plenty of vitality and essence that I’m not afraid of being drained. Even so, I had to specially select Legendary Companion Eggs that require relatively fewer Primordial Energy points. Only then can I succeed and survive. It’s almost impossible for others to succeed, unless you aren’t afraid of death.</p>
<p>“Give up, man. I’m unique,” Li Xuan added smugly.</p>
<p>What Li Xuan had said served as a warning for Zhou Wen. The latter was obviously afraid of death, but the blood-colored avatar in-game wasn’t. Perhaps he could use the blood-colored avatar to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no way of taking the Companion Egg into the game. To make an attempt, I can only wait until a Companion Egg drops in-game. With this in mind, he was quite tempted.</p>
<p>The phone’s camera feature is able to download dimensional zones. I wonder if it can be used on Companion Eggs? When Zhou Wen thought of this, he took out the Companion Egg and phone from his pocket.</p>
<p>He was sitting behind Li Xuan and, with him in the way, no one else could see what he was doing. Zhou Wen then attempted to open the mysterious phone’s camera function and aimed it at the Skeleton General Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Beep!</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the camera function was usable. When the camera was pointed at the Skeleton General Companion Egg, a green box appeared on the screen, and with a beep, it focused on the Companion Egg. At the same time, many text and numbers appeared.</p>
<p>Skeleton General Companion Egg: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Oath of City Defense</p>
<p>Strength: 15</p>
<p>Speed: 13</p>
<p>Constitution: 16</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Penetrating Pierce (Rank 3)</p>
<p>Companion Form: General Bone Armor</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Skeleton General’s stats in surprise. It wasn’t because the stats were surprising, but that no one was able to run tests before a Companion Egg was incubated; thus, making it impossible to know how good a Companion Beast would be before incubation.</p>
<p>With just a snap, the phone could list down detailed numbers. It was amazing.</p>
<p>The same Companion Beast type all had different stats. The higher they were, the better they were naturally. It was especially so with Primordial Energy Skills. The higher the Rank, the more valuable the Companion Beast was.</p>
<p>Beep!</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was looking at the Skeleton General’s stats, his phone beeped again. At the same time, a notification popped up on the screen.</p>
<p>“Skeleton General and Mutated Vigor Ant have a compatibility score of 47%. Fusion has a success rate of 47%. Proceed with fusion?”</p>
<p>A ‘yes’ and ‘no’ option popped up on the screen. Without any hesitation, he chose ‘yes.’ Then there was a clicking sound—the sound of a camera’s shutter.</p>
<p>The phone snapped a picture of the Skeleton General, simultaneously making the Skeleton General Companion Egg in Zhou Wen’s hand vanish into thin air.</p>
<h3 id='chapter42'>Chapter 42: Underground Buddha City</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As the phone screen presented the Skeleton General Companion Egg, Zhou Wen’s Mutated Vigor Ant appeared beside it.</p>
<p>A notification popped up on the screen again: ‘As the Mutated Vigor Ant has already finished incubating, the Skeleton General Companion Egg will be used as supplementary material. Proceed with fusion?’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose ‘yes.’ Since he was unable to incubate the Skeleton General Companion Egg and there were chances for him to obtain Mutated Vigor Ants again in the future, there was no harm trying.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen making the choice, the Skeleton General Companion Egg flew towards the Mutated Vigor Ant. After infusing into the Mutated Vigor Ant, the screen immediately turned into a spiraling chaos.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>After a while, the game screen finally returned to normal. At the same time, there was a notification sound as the following line appeared: ‘Fusion successful. Mortal Mutated Vigor Ant has evolved into Mortal Mutated Skeleton Ant.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he heard that. The outcome was still a Mortal Companion Beast after fusing with a Legendary Skeleton General. It felt like a terrible loss.</p>
<p>When he carefully studied the Skeleton Ant after the successful fusion, he saw that its originally red carapace had turned dark red. Furthermore, the carapace’s texture had changed. It now seemed like bone that had been dyed red. Even its feelers and claws had the same texture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its claws had turned sharp, covered with razor-like barbed bones. It looked ferocious and terrifying, especially its two front claws. They looked like two strange sickles.</p>
<p>Although it had evolved to something rather strong, it was still at the Mortal stage. No matter how much it evolved, it had no way of competing with a Companion Beast at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Tapping on the Mutated Skeleton Ant’s stats to take a look, Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. Compared to the Mutated Vigor Ant, its stats had changed tremendously.</p>
<p>Mutated Skeleton Ant: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 10</p>
<p>Speed: 9</p>
<p>Constitution: 10</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 9</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Skeleton Pierce (Rank 10)</p>
<p>Companion Form: Bracer</p>
<p>Strength and Companion Beast has increased to 10. Same for the talent skill… Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had never heard of Companion Beasts having Rank 10 talent skills.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen always believed that Rank 9 was the limit to Primordial Energy Skills. Only when his Ashen Palm reached Rank 10 did he realize that there was such a thing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the urge to summon the Mutated Skeleton Ant to see what it looked like. After all, it was drawn in a cartoon style in-game. There were bound to be differences in real life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was sitting on Li Xuan’s Jade-Eyed White Tiger. This wasn’t the best time to summon it.</p>
<p>Despite his arrogance, Li Xuan put away his Companion Beast at the entrance to Sunset College. He then walked in with Zhou Wen without the pompous attitude.</p>
<p>Sunset College was a new college that was established after the dimensional storms. It was very close to the Dragon Gate Grotto—the biggest dimensional zone in Luoyang to date. To this day, humanity had not finished exploring it in its entirety. It was even said that humans had only managed to explore a very tiny area.</p>
<p>Apart from the Dragon Gate Grotto, there were several dimensional zones found inside Sunset College. It could be said that Sunset College took most of the dimensional zone resources in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Due to it being a partially-restricted school, the students still had to wear uniforms despite being university students. It was a little like military wear.</p>
<p>It was still the holidays, but there were plenty of students on campus. Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were stopped by the guards at the door.</p>
<p>The guards of Sunset College weren’t security guards but real soldiers. In fact, the dimensional zones in Sunset College were guarded by real military troops.</p>
<p>Li Xuan took out two special passes before being permitted to enter.</p>
<p>As Li Xuan led Zhou Wen in, he explained, “Luoyang was home to thirteen Chinese dynasties., Ancient cities had been built on this piece of land for millennia, but for all kinds of reasons, these ancient cities had been destroyed and lost to the rivers of time. It could be said that the ground that Luoyang sits on is piled up from multiple ancient cities. Ever since the dimensional storms, many dimensional zones were formed underground. The deeper one goes, the more terrifying the zone becomes.</p>
<p>“People from Luoyang are accustomed to calling the underground dimensional zones dungeons. At present, the explored dungeon has four levels. There’s definitely more, but no human expert can get any lower. This time, an entrance to a new dungeon was discovered at Ancient Inlet, and new dimensional creatures and organ-type Companion Beasts were found inside…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened attentively to Li Xuan’s explanation. Sunset College was just too huge. After walking for nearly an hour, they finally arrived at Ancient Inlet which Li Xuan had mentioned.</p>
<p>Ancient Inlet was, in fact, a marshland. Rumor was that it was once a river mouth of the ancient Yellow River which once brought disaster to this area by drowning the ancient cities. Later, the Yellow River moved and stopped flowing over this region.</p>
<p>In this former riverbed, a new dimensional zone was discovered. When Zhou Wen looked at a stele inside the marshland, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>The stele stood in the middle of the marsh at a height of over ten meters tall. There was a sitting Buddha engraved on it with fairies circling him.</p>
<p>Amongst the various engraved symbols, Zhou Wen found a tiny palm symbol. It was rather inconspicuous amongst the fairies and Buddha palm symbols, but to Zhou Wen, it was extremely familiar.</p>
<p>On the city gates of Guide Ancient City, Zhou Wen had seen a similar symbol. Furthermore, he had focused his mysterious phone on it to download the Guide Ancient City game dungeon.</p>
<p>However, this tiny palm symbol was a little different from the one he had seen at Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>The palm in the Guide Ancient City’s symbol carried something akin to an onion or garlic. But here, engraved in the middle of the tiny palm symbol was a blooming lotus flower.</p>
<p>I’ll try to download this game dungeon now. Zhou Wen took out his phone and turned on the camera before aiming it at the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Beep!</p>
<p>A green box appeared on the screen as it focused on the tiny palm symbol. After the light beep, the familiar ‘Installing’ word appeared.</p>
<p>It really works. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Imagining that Zhou Wen was snapping photos, Li Xuan said, “This stele looks to be in the style of the Northern Wei dynasty. Back then, Buddhism thrived…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t listening to what Li Xuan had to say. The phone had finished installing as a lotus icon appeared on his phone’s home screen. Beneath it were three words: ‘Underground Buddha City.’</p>
<h3 id='chapter43'>Chapter 43: Buddha Heart Lotus</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The bottom of the stele was the entrance to the dimensional zone where military troops were standing guard. Li Xuan took out two entrance passes before they entered.</p>
<p>Going down the blue-tiled stairs beneath the stele, they ventured deep underground. Zhou Wen finally knew why the people of Luoyang described dimensional zones as dungeons.</p>
<p>In an underground space tens of meters deep, a dilapidated ancient city connected as one with the underground world. All sorts of blue-tiled ancient architecture made it appear like a maze.</p>
<p>At fixed distances, oil lanterns hung on the blue-tiled walls for lighting purposes. The dim yellow light made the already dark and humid ancient dungeon appear even older.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were on a street. The buildings that stood on either side were engraved with several symbols related to Buddhism. Even the blue-tiled roofs were engraved with flying fairies.</p>
<p>“Trading 8-valued Strength Crystals for 8-valued Speed Crystals. Grab it if you want it!”</p>
<p>“One Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal. Only trading, no selling…”</p>
<p>“The most complete and detailed Buddha City map. With one map in hand, Buddha City is your oyster…”</p>
<p>There were several youths dressed in school uniforms setting up stalls along both sides of the street. Clearly, they were seniors of Sunset College.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had wanted to buy a map but was stopped by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Buddha City was only recently discovered. The students here can only explore the vicinity. What value can their maps have? I have here the latest map released by the military. It’s much more useful than theirs. Let’s head over to the Lotus Pond to try our luck. Let’s see if we can find the Buddha Heart Lotus,” Li Xuan said as he walked with a map in hand.</p>
<p>“What’s a Buddha Heart Lotus?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a kind of plant-type dimensional creature. Didn’t I mention that organ-type Companion Beasts were found here? Buddha Heart Lotus is one of them. Buddha Heart Lotus in Companion Beast form is the heart,” Li Xuan explained.</p>
<p>Li Xuan held the map and navigated the dark dungeon with Zhou Wen in tow. Perhaps a result of the dimensional creatures having been wiped clean, they didn’t encounter a single one.</p>
<p>After walking for nearly an hour, the scene before them opened up. They saw a large swath of green lotus leaves appear in their sights. They were as green as jadeite and they shimmered with a green glow.</p>
<p>This huge underground lotus pond was several acres in size. The glimmering green light dyed the entire underground world with a green hue and at spots relatively far from the bank, one could see huge white lotus flowers blooming.</p>
<p>“Is that the Buddha Heart Lotus?” Zhou Wen stared at the huge white lotus and asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s the Buddha Heart Lotus, a plant-type dimensional creature. However, those Buddha Heart Lotuses are too far from the bank. Unless one can fly, there’s no way of getting near them,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Can’t you swim over?” Zhou Wen looked at the water in the pond. It was a transparent green and resembled crystals.</p>
<p>“Definitely not. The water here can even melt steel beams. Humans will be reduced to nothing instantly,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, what’s the point of coming?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“That’s why I said we are trying our luck. If a Buddha Heart Lotus happens to bloom near the bank, we have a chance.” Li Xuan rubbed his nose and said, “But it seems we aren’t having much luck. There isn’t a Buddha Heart Lotus blooming by the bank.”</p>
<p>Just as he said that they heard galloping sounds coming from behind them. They turned their heads and saw a white horse bolt over with a cold-eyed man sitting on it.</p>
<p>The white horse was extremely fast, allowing him to arrive in front of the lotus pond almost instantaneously. However, the man had no intention of reining his horse in and it didn’t drop in speed at all. It rushed straight into the lotus pond.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen was astonished to find a pair of snow-white wings grow out from the white horse’s sides. It leaped into the air and flew above the lotus pond.</p>
<p>“White-Winged Flying Horse at the Mortal stage. A very rare Companion Beast. That’s presently the only one in Sunset College. Its owner is Sunset College’s sophomore, Luo Xuan. He’s been called one of the four most handsome hunks of Sunset College. I don’t like him; he’s very arrogant,” Li Xuan said as he looked at the White-Winged Flying Horse in envy.</p>
<p>His Jade-Eyed White Tiger was far faster than the White-Winged Flying Horse, but it couldn’t fly. Naturally, he wasn’t able to ride on a white horse and leap across the lotus pond as coolly as Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan rode on his white horse and approached a Buddha Heart Lotus. When he was about ten meters away from it, he suddenly saw the petals of a Buddha Heart Lotus close up on itself, turning into an oval. When the petals suddenly spread open, a green lotus seed was shot out, seemingly blasting Luo Xuan with a cannonball.</p>
<p>With a stoic expression, a flash appeared at Luo Xuan’s waist, halving the green lotus seed. Only then did others notice a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>“What a fast move!” Zhou Wen was somewhat astonished.</p>
<p>“The Luo family are swordsmen. The Azure Star Sword Anthology is a rather famous sword art. It’s not surprising that he’s fast with his sword,’ Li Xuan said, feeling sour grapes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he was jealous of Luo Xuan’s sword techniques. It was just that the White-Winged Flying Horse drew too much attention. Although it was at the Mortal stage, it was cooler than his Jade-Eyed White Tiger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was envious as well. Although the Mutated Skeleton Ant was strong, it had a frightening look. In terms of looks, the White-Winged Flying Horse was on a completely different level.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t care about looks. It was simply that the White-Winged Flying Horse’s ability of flight made it extremely useful.</p>
<p>The White-Winged Flying Horse swept across the white lotus pond as Luo Xuan swept his sword, slicing off the huge white Buddha Heart Lotuses.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen could only watch in envy as the Buddha Heart Lotuses were harvested by Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>“If I had known, I would have tried to obtain a Companion Beast that can fly,” Li Xuan said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Let’s head elsewhere to take a look. There should be other dimensional creatures apart from Buddha Heart Lotuses, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The area ahead has dimensional creatures, but it’s a little odd there. When the military explored the area, many people died for no reason. It wasn’t an exception even with Legendary experts. It has already been labeled a restricted zone. Ordinary students cannot approach the area,” Li Xuan said as he looked at his map.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan, “How did those people die?”</p>
<p>“If the cause of death was known, it wouldn’t be called odd. They just died while walking. No dimensional creature was sighted, nor were there any wounds. Even when the corpses were taken back for an autopsy, it was discovered that their organs had failed and they had shriveled terribly,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Other than these two places, is there nowhere else in Buddha City with dimensional creatures?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely more in the deeper areas of Buddha City. However, even the military hasn’t explored the area, so how would the typical student dare to venture in? It would only be courting death. We can’t risk our lives for adventure, right?”</p>
<p>After a pause, Li Xuan added, “In fact, the military has offered a reward. If anyone can crack the mystery of the deaths, the military will reward them with a Legendary Companion Egg. Furthermore, they will be awarded perpetual rights to entering Buddha City.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter44'>Chapter 44: Blood-Patterned Buddha Heart Lotus</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had wanted to say something when he heard a splash. It was as though a bomb had exploded in the water.</p>
<p>The duo turned their heads and saw a wave rise up from the lotus pond like an erupting undersea volcano. Amidst the wave, a gigantic lotus flower with a diameter exceeded ten meters emerged.</p>
<p>The lotus flower was different from the normal Buddha Heart Lotus. Ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus had petals that were pure white, but this Buddha Heart Lotus had blood vessel-like patterns on their white petals. The patterns were faint, outlining a sitting Buddha’s silhouette. It appeared as though a blood-colored Buddha was sitting on each petal.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan rode on his White-Winged Flying Horse as he dodged the splashes in midair, but some still managed to splattered onto his steed.</p>
<p>The White-Winged Flying Horse neighed in pain as its snow-white hide began corroding away, turning into a bloody, gaping hole. It looked extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan wore an ugly expression as he struggled to steer the White-Winged Flying Horse towards the bank. If they were to fall into the water, they were doomed.</p>
<p>Real life wasn’t a game. Be it a human or a Companion Beast, death meant death. There were no second chances. It wasn’t like Zhou Wen’s game, which could be repeated after dying.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan wished to escape, but the strange Buddha Heart Lotus had no intention of sparing him. It shot out a lotus seed the size of a basketball that tore through the sky and headed for the White-Winged Flying Horse and Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>Typically, lotus seeds shot out by Buddha Heart Lotuses were green in color, but this lotus seed was like crystal blood. It appeared instantly in front of Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>The White-Winged Flying Horse could no longer dodge in time. Luo Xuan drew his sword and cleaved, sending a beam that sliced through the blood-colored lotus seed. However, before his sword could fully slice through the blood-colored lotus seed, his expression changed.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Luo Xuan retracted his sword as he tapped his toes on the White-Winged Flying Horse’s back, jumping nearly three meters back like a hawk.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>At the same time, the blood-colored lotus seed exploded, turning into bloody rain that enveloped the White-Winged Flying Horse.</p>
<p>Following that, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan saw a horrifying scene. The blood landed on the White-Winged Flying Horse like red-hot metal hitting snow. It instantly melted away the White-Winged Flying Horse’s flesh.</p>
<p>In just seconds, the White-Winged Flying Horse’s flesh was completely gone, revealing its white bones. All it could do was let out a tragic neigh before plummeting into the lotus pond. There was zero hope for it.</p>
<p>“Little White…” Luo Xuan yelled out in anger and sadness but to no avail. He was still in danger.</p>
<p>He was at least five hundred meters away from the bank. With the White-Winged Flying Horse dead, he had no means of flying. The lotus pond was no different from the rivers of hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan wanted to help, but they were helpless. They didn’t have any Companion Beasts capable of flight, nor did they have invulnerable bodies. All they could do was stand at the side and watch, unable to do a thing.</p>
<p>As the duo believed that Luo Xuan was doomed, they saw him tap a toe on a lotus leaf, soaring back up as though he was weightless as he stepped towards the next leaf.</p>
<p>“Hey, this pretty boy has quite some skills. He even has a Primordial Energy Skill that imbues alacrity,” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Luo Xuan leap up from the lotus leaf, he was delighted to see the frail lotus leaf tremble slightly instead of being crushed by him.</p>
<p>“In the dimensional zones in Sunset College, are there places that drop Primordial Energy Skill that imbues alacrity?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Obviously. The most famous one is Dragon Gate Grotto.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen began planning to visit Dragon Gate Grotto when he had the chance. If he could download the game dungeon at Dragon Gate Grotto, he could grind for one without any worries. Such a Primordial Energy Skill would be extremely useful. Even if he was no match for his enemies, he could always use it to escape.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Luo Xuan used the lotus leaves to leap into the sky, but before he got far, two salvos were heard. More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds enveloped the area, sealing off all of Luo Xuan’s exits, leaving no room for him to dodge.</p>
<p>Although he still had half a sword left, it was useless against the blood-colored lotus seeds. After slicing them apart, their explosive might would only grow stronger.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, the clothes on Luo Xuan tore apart, revealing a blue ox tattoo. The next second, it tore out of his body, taking on the form of a blue ox Companion Beast. It appeared in front of Luo Xuan and blocked the blood-colored lotus seeds.</p>
<p>With the blue ox as a shield, Luo Xuan finally found a chance of survival. At that split second, he rushed out of the lotus seed bombardment.</p>
<p>However, his blue ox Companion Beast had taken the hit. Once the seeds exploded, splattering the blood within them onto it, its flesh and blood began corroding. It then plummeted into the pond with a tragic cry.</p>
<p>“That pretty boy, Luo Xuan, sure has plenty of expensive stuff up his sleeves. He actually has two Mortal Companion Beasts. Unfortunately, it still won’t be easy for him to survive. He’s just too far from the bank,” Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Li Xuan as he stared at the lotus pond.</p>
<p>The White-Winged Flying Horse and the blue ox had their flesh corroded, reducing them to a pile of bones as they fell into the pond.</p>
<p>This terrifying scene made Zhou Wen recall his Mutated Skeleton Ant.</p>
<p>The lotus pond and the Buddha Heart Lotus’s bloody liquid seemed to be only capable of corroding flesh. Bones weren’t corroded, so was it possible for the Mutated Skeleton Ant who was already reduced to bone to survive in the lotus pond?</p>
<p>At this thought, Zhou Wen summoned his Mutated Skeleton Ant and commanded it to approach the lotus pond. Then, it extended one of its claw tips into the water.</p>
<p>When the Mutated Skeleton Ant flew out of the back of his hand, it seemed to be made out of blood-stained bones. Its body was filled with bone spikes and it was much bigger than before its evolution. It looked like a skeleton tank, much more ferocious and terrifying than in-game.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t. What Companion Beast is that?” By the side, Li Xuan jumped in fright from the appearance of the Mutated Skeleton Ant. Then, he realized that it was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Skeleton ant,” Zhou Wen answered without much thought as he made the skeleton ant extend one claw into the lotus pond.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Li Xuan jumped in fright.</p>
<p>Soon, Li Xuan realized that the skeleton ant was completely fine, despite extending its claw into the water. It hadn’t been corroded by the lotus pond’s water.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen confirm that his theory was right. The Mutated Skeleton Ant, which was all bone, wasn’t afraid of the lotus pond’s water.</p>
<p>With a command from him, the Mutated Skeleton Ant slowly entered the lotus pond. Nothing happened despite its body being soaked in the water. Clearly, the pond water had zero effect on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally worried that the Mutated Skeleton Ant couldn’t swim, but he was immediately relieved when he saw it paddling its claws on the surface of the water and the lotus leaves like a water spider. It crawled at a rapid speed, in no way different than it was on land.</p>
<h3 id='chapter45'>Chapter 45: Elites Gathering at the Lotus Pond</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>When Li Xuan saw the Mutated Skeleton Ant crawling across the water at a rapid speed, he turned agape.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan hopped across the lotus leaves with great speed, but the Buddha Heart Lotus shot its second round of lotus seed bombardment. He had nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if he could dodge the second salvo, his Primordial Energy could hardly support his continuous use of his Primordial Energy Skill with alacrity traits. He would still die if he were to land in the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard a voice from the bank. “Luo Xuan, jump on that ant’s back!”</p>
<p>Luo Xuan had no idea who was speaking, nor could he process it. He tried his best to avoid a large portion of the blood-colored lotus seeds, but there was one he couldn’t dodge completely. All he could do was grit his teeth and block it with his sword.</p>
<p>Although he knew that this action was meaningless—the blood-colored lotus seed would explode once it struck his incomplete sword, reducing him to a pool of blood—he still chose to do so due to his survival instinct.</p>
<p>Before his sword hit the blood-colored lotus seed, Luo Xuan suddenly saw a blood-colored figure flash above him. A huge, ghastly ant had leaped over him, slamming into the lotus seed.</p>
<p>The blood-colored lotus seed exploded on the ant’s head, splattering it all over with its contents. However, the ferocious-looking ant seemed unfazed by it. It landed on the water surface as it began moving its six claws rapidly, turning to crawl towards Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan was alarmed, imagining that the ant was about to attack him. However, upon recalling the voice and how the ant had blocked the seed, he immediately understood what was happening. He exerted strength on the lotus leaf and jumped onto the Mutated Skeleton Ant’s back.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant crawled swiftly across the water surface, much faster than Luo Xuan’s hopping about. By the time the Buddha Heart Lotus produced its third salvo, the ant had already escaped beyond its reach.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant rushed onto the bank and stopped in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan jumped off the ant’s back. Even if he were dumb, he could tell that the Mutated Skeleton Ant was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. The one who had shouted was likely Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“My name is Luo Xuan. I’ll definitely repay you for saving my life. May I know your name?” Luo Xuan said.</p>
<p>“I’m Zhou Wen. He’s Li Xuan. We are fellow schoolmates. It’s nothing, so don’t take it to heart,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen. I’ll remember you.” Luo Xuan sized up Zhou Wen’s looks before turning around to leave.</p>
<p>“That fellow is already in such a pathetic state, but he still wears that cocky look. He pisses me off,” Li Xuan couldn’t stand Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>But moments later, Li Xuan was happy again. He chuckled. “Without the White-Winged Flying Horse, let’s see how he can act cool in school in the future.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him as he sized up the gigantic Buddha Heart Lotus in the middle of the lotus pond. He guessed that it was a Legendary stage dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, this skeleton ant is quite impressive. It seems to be the Buddha Heart Lotus’s nemesis. Why don’t you send it over and try eliminating that Buddha Heart Lotus? If you succeed, you might even get something good,” Li Xuan said as he looked at it.</p>
<p>“Forget it. That Buddha Heart Lotus is odd. I only have this Companion Beast. It’s best I don’t take risks.” Zhou Wen planned on returning to grind the Underground Buddha City dungeon. In-game, his Companion Beast could be revived unlike in real life. There was no need for him to take such huge risks here.</p>
<p>“You are good at everything except that you lack the spirit and fervor of a young man. What’s there to be afraid of? It’s only a Companion Beast. You can get another one in the future. If you can kill that strange Buddha Heart Lotus now, who knows if a special Companion Beast will drop. Wouldn’t you make a killing that way?” Li Xuan commented in dejection.</p>
<p>“I don’t like betting.” Zhou Wen shook his head as he turned around and headed back.</p>
<p>Li Xuan could only helplessly follow Zhou Wen to head back. It wasn’t easy for him to get two entry passes, and now they were returning without even killing a single dimensional creature after coming to Underground Buddha City.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we visit that bizarre place where everyone dies mysteriously?” Li Xuan suggested as he was unwilling to leave empty-handed.</p>
<p>“You have a Legendary Companion Beast to protect you. I don’t. Besides, I don’t wish to bet my life.” Zhou Wen walked off without even turning back.</p>
<p>“You have zero spirit of adventure.” Li Xuan shrugged before leaving Underground Buddha City with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Li Xuan grumbled the entire way about how timid Zhou Wen was, but the latter completely ignored him. After returning to Li Xuan’s place, he went straight to his room and launched the Underground Buddha City dungeon.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar entered, it looked identical to what Zhou Wen had seen of Underground Buddha City. He then used the map from Li Xuan and used it to find the lotus pond in-game.</p>
<p>Unlike reality, where the Buddha Heart Lotuses near the bank had been sliced clean by students, leaving only Buddha Heart Lotuses deep inside the lotus pond, the game was filled with Buddha Heart Lotuses everywhere across the pond. However, there wasn’t a gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>To prevent the blood-colored avatar from dying, Zhou Wen didn’t let it enter the lotus pond. He summoned the Mutated Skeleton Ant and got it to rush towards a Buddha Heart Lotus situated near the bank.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant’s sharp front claws sliced through the green lotus seeds that shot out as it didn’t hesitate to slice through the Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>“Killed Mortal dimensional creature, Buddha Heart Lotus.”</p>
<p>The system’s notification appeared, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ordered the Mutated Skeleton Ant to storm into the lotus pond, slicing any Buddha Heart Lotuses he saw. After killing more than thirty Buddha Heart Lotuses, a dimensional crystal finally dropped.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen realized that it was a Constitution Crystal with a value of 2. All it could be used for was replenish some of his expended Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was mindlessly killing Buddha Heart Lotuses, the news of the gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus’s appearance had spread across Sunset College.</p>
<p>Many students who hadn’t left campus during the school break rushed to the lotus pond when they heard. There was no lack of powerful Legendary stage students.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to slay the gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus. When a Legendary stage student released a Legendary Golden-Eyed Condor Companion Beast in a bid to slay the Buddha Heart Lotus from the air; to everyone’s surprise, it was struck down. It nearly fell into the pond and almost all its feathers dropped off.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Golden-Eyed Condor’s owner was quick to react and made it return early. However, it barely escaped with its life. To make it receive a full recovery was not easy.</p>
<p>Many Legendary stage students tried various methods but failed to make much progress. After all, Companion Beasts capable of flight were relatively rare. And with a place like the lotus pond, humans didn’t even dare do the deed themselves, relegating it to their Companion Beasts.</p>

<p>Ding!</p>
<p>In the Underground Buddha City dungeon of the game, Zhou Wen slew countless Buddha Heart Lotuses before a Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal dropped.</p>
<p>He was somewhat disappointed. After spending the entire night grinding—with the dawn approaching—not a single Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg had dropped. The dimensional crystals he obtained were useless, with only the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal being of some use.</p>
<p>Li Xuan hadn’t informed Zhou Wen what Primordial Energy Skill the Buddha Heart Lotus had. However, from the lotus seeds it shot out, it was likely a projectile-type Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Mortal stage Primordial Energy Skills basically didn’t have the ability to project their Primordial Energy outwards. This was limited to a small number even at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Even for a projectile-type Primordial Energy Skill, only the use of a physical projectile could be used at the Mortal stage. There was no way to condense the Primordial Energy into a projectile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly absorbed the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal and quickly a strange force traveled from his phone into his body.</p>
<p>The force of the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal was different from the crystals he had previously absorbed. Its force was extremely mild like a spring’s warm water infusing his body. It slowly flowed through his body before gushing into his heart. It strengthened his heart, making it beat with greater strength.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal. Attained Primordial Energy Crystal Heart Meditation (Rank 7).’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried using Heart Meditation and found a warm stream flow out of his heart into every corner of his body. Other than giving him a warm and fuzzy feeling, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>No wonder Li Xuan only said that Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Beasts are awesome, but he didn’t mention the Buddha Heart Lotus’s Primordial Energy Skill. It’s really useless. Zhou Wen didn’t mind as he continued ordering the Mutated Skeleton Ant to slay the Buddha Heart Lotuses.</p>
<p>As he was having a great time killing them, he suddenly heard a boom. The pond water nearby spewed hundreds of feet high as a gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus with petals having a sitting Buddha tore out of the water.</p>
<p>Before the Mutated Skeleton Ant could react, the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus had shot out more than ten blood-colored lotus seeds at it.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Mutated Skeleton Ant wasn’t afraid of the corrosion, Zhou Wen ordered it to rush forward against the torrent of seeds.</p>
<p>When they struck the Mutated Skeleton Ant, they blasted open, releasing the blood within. They flowed everywhere across its body but failed to deal any damage.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant dashed towards the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus and when it was about six meters away, it leaped up, inward slashing its razor-sharp claws at the flower bud.</p>
<p>Based on Zhou Wen’s observations, the Buddha Heart Lotus itself wasn’t very powerful. Even if it was a Legendary stage creature, the Mutated Skeleton Ant had a chance of cleaving off its bud based on the Strength and talent skill it had.</p>
<p>With the Mutated Skeleton Ant right in front of the Buddha Heart Lotus, the Buddha Heart Lotus suddenly spread its petals open like a bizarre mouth and devoured its aggressor. The petals then contracted, turning into a closed bud.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen saw the system’s notification of the Mutated Skeleton Ant’s death.</p>
<p>Indeed, when the petals spread open again, the Mutated Skeleton Ant was nowhere to be seen. There weren’t any remnants of its bones.</p>
<p>What a terrifying Buddha Heart Lotus. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>Without the Mutated Skeleton Ant, Zhou Wen lacked the ability to enter the lotus pond to attempt killing the Buddha Heart Lotus. Although his Companion Beast could be revived in-game, it could only be revived together with the blood-colored avatar. This also meant that when Zhou Wen revived the blood-colored avatar with a drop of blood, his Companion Beast would also revive.</p>
<p>But as the blood-colored avatar was still alive, sending it to its death for nothing would be quite a waste.</p>
<p>Looking at the map Li Xuan had given him, he controlled the blood-colored avatar and sent it to the restricted zone carved out by the military. Since death was required, he might as well visit to figure out the mystery.</p>
<p>In the ancient, dark, and moist Underground Buddha City, there were crumbling walls everywhere. There was also plenty of sand and gravel that tumbled across the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a stone bridge when he approached the restricted zone on the map.</p>
<p>Typical stone bridges had flowers, grass, birds, or beasts patterned on the bridge railings. But this bridge had several colored, flying fairies.</p>
<p>They were in the form of young women as their clothes fluttered in the sky while they danced. It was a staggeringly beautiful sight.</p>
<p>Comparing it to the map, Zhou Wen quickly confirmed that the restricted zone was just after the bridge. The soldiers had died mysteriously on the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only gaming, so he naturally didn’t have many apprehensions. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to step onto the bridge.</p>
<p>He didn’t discover anything abnormal, it seemed an extremely normal stone bridge. The blood-colored avatar easily crossed and arrived at the other side.</p>
<p>Across the bridge, it’s original appearance could no longer be identified. Boulders filled both sides, leaving a narrow path among the rock that was enough for a single person’s passage.</p>
<p>There was a faint flickering of flames at the end of the rocky path. It was likely an illumination object such as a fire torch or oil lamp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed the path but didn’t discover anything abnormal. He then controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk in and head toward the light.</p>
<p>The passage gradually headed up and it was then that Zhou Wen realized that there were stone steps at his feet. However, due to the mud and rubble, the steps had been hidden.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, he saw the stone steps exposed outside.</p>
<p>He didn’t encounter any danger despite walking hundreds of meters. However, he didn’t let down his guard as he kept observing the stone walls and the steps beneath him.</p>
<p>But nothing happened at all. Instead, the flaming light gradually turned clear. With it, he could barely make out a grandiose entrance.</p>
<p>The entrance had a plaque that was rather old and damaged. The red paint had mostly faded and the text was already very blurry. At this distance, it was impossible to see what the words were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to approach the entrance. Shortly after, he finally saw the words: ‘Small Buddha Temple.’</p>
<p>What’s Small Buddha Temple? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had heard of Grand Buddha Temple, but he had never heard of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>While he was in thought, he suddenly saw the game screen turn black—clearly, the blood-colored avatar had died.</p>
<p>How did it die? He couldn’t help but frown. He had been staring at the blood-colored avatar the entire time, but he didn’t see how it had died.</p>
<p>After dripping his blood to revive, he sent the blood-colored avatar to the Underground Buddha City. He made the first stop at the lotus pond and spawned the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus, only to have the Mutated Skeleton Ant killed again.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar then headed to Small Buddha Temple, but it once again died mysteriously at the stone steps in front of the entrance. Zhou Wen had watched very carefully with widened eyes, but he failed to see how the blood-colored avatar had died under his nose.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen shared the same feeling when the blood-colored avatar died. At that instant, he felt all his organs suddenly contract.</p>
<h3 id='chapter47'>Chapter 47: Reunion Meal</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Of course, this was the feeling the blood-colored avatar had given Zhou Wen. None of his organs really contracted.</p>
<p>Strange. I didn’t see any dimensional creatures appear. There wasn’t even a strand of grass in the stone rifts. What could have caused the blood-colored avatar to die? It’s no wonder the military are helpless. This place is indeed quite odd. Zhou Wen was thinking of trying another round at the lotus pond and Small Buddha Temple when he heard knocking on the door.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you up?” Li Xuan’s voice sounded.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the sky had already lit up. He had unknowingly gamed for the entire night. Time passed way too quickly.</p>
<p>“It’s unlocked,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan pushed the door open and saw Zhou Wen gaming. Furthermore, he had dark circles under his eyes and his hair was disheveled. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “Don’t tell me you gamed the entire night.”</p>
<p>“Tell me if there’s something interesting. Otherwise don’t disturb my sleep,” Zhou Wen said as he put down his phone.</p>
<p>He still planned on having a short nap. Sleep was a form of repose for him in the past, but now, he found sleep torture.</p>
<p>The feeling of sleep paralysis was terrible. Furthermore, he often heard devil-like murmurs that went on throughout the entire night.</p>
<p>It was only because Zhou Wen was capable of completely focusing that he could ignore these soul-crushing murmurs and withstand the pressure. If any other person were to suffer such torture daily, they would probably have gone mad.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to sleep. It was also why he gamed with such obsession without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Sunset College’s matriculation day is earlier than the average university. School will officially begin in a few days. If nothing surprising happens, we might have a chance to watch a good show play out after we matriculate,” Li Xuan said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“What good show?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said mysteriously, “I heard that many Legendary stage students ranked in the top twenty of Sunset College have gone to the lotus pond, hoping to slay that gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus, but not only have they failed, but some have even lost their Legendary Companion Beasts. Now, they are all actively purchasing Companion Beasts capable of flight. We should be in time to watch a grand battle play out.”</p>
<p>“Sunset College and the military have Epic stage experts. Why don’t they just mobilize them to vanquish that Buddha Heart Lotus?” Zhou Wen asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>“If every problem is resolved, how are they to nurture the younger generation? The League has rules that reserve these resources for us, the future seedlings. Unless it’s something special, the military or school will not interfere.”</p>
<p>Pausing, Li Xuan continued, “I was planning on having breakfast with you, but looking at your present state, you probably want to have some more sleep. I’ll have breakfast alone.”</p>
<p>After Li Xuan walked out, Zhou Wen slept. As always, he quickly fell asleep. The sleep paralysis happened once again as the devil-like murmurs kept sounding in his ears like a fly that he couldn’t chase away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the discomfort and noise as he focused his mind on sleeping. However, he was unable to sleep as soundly as he used to.</p>
<p>After about five hours of sleep, he was woken up by his phone ringing. He felt his mind a lot clearer.</p>
<p>“Fang Ruoxi?” Zhou Wen saw the caller’s number and was surprised that it was Fang Ruoxi.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, long time no see. I heard you applied to Sunset College. Is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Great.” Fang Ruoxi seemed to exhale in relief.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what Fang Ruoxi was getting at.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I still have something else to do. Bye.” Fang Ruoxi’s voice sounded a lot happier and she hung up after saying goodbye.</p>
<p>She’s crazy! Zhou Wen looked at his phone, having been rendered speechless.</p>
<p>Just as he put his phone down, it rang again. This time, it was Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>“Dad.” Zhou Wen picked up the call.</p>
<p>“Son, are you in Luoyang now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. What’s up?” Zhou Wen had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“Little Lan wishes to treat you to a meal. Let’s have a reunion,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m having it pretty good over here. It’s probably good over on your side, so there’s no need to force a meeting, right?” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“No matter what you say, we will be a family in the future. It’s only right to get to know one another. Besides, Little Lan really wishes to meet you. Come have a meal on account of your dad.” Zhou Lingfeng didn’t show any intentions of giving up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before saying, “Alright then. What’s the time and place?”</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to find the place. Where are you? I’ll get someone to pick you up.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gave an address. he didn’t mention that it was Li Xuan’s place and only said a nearby street’s name.</p>
<p>“Alright. Wait there. I’ll get someone to pick you up.” Zhou Lingfeng hung up once that was said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know when his ride would come. So all he could do was get out of bed, wash up, and head out. He got to the designated street and, when he saw no one, he crouched by the side of the road to game.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t continue grinding at Underground Buddha City. Instead, he chose the Ant Nest. He wanted to see if he now had a chance of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Before he found it, he heard the sound of a vehicle stopping beside him. It was a jeep.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a long snow-white leg extend out of the car when he looked up. Then, he saw a familiar face.</p>
<p>“An Jing?” Not expecting Zhou Lingfeng to get An Jing to pick him up, he was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen’s phone and couldn’t help but frown when she saw the game running on the screen. She then sized him up and coldly said, “You didn’t cultivate the Sun Strafe Art?”</p>
<p>“I was about to ask you. I asked my dad and he said he didn’t give me the Sun Strafe Art,” Zhou Wen said to An Jing as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to a safe corner before quitting the game.</p>
<p>“I gave you the Sun Strafe Art to harm you,” An Jing said with a cold expression before getting into the car. Without looking back, she asked, “Aren’t you getting in?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected An Jing to be so direct. He was momentarily unsure if she was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>However, since she was here and he had agreed to meet, there was naturally no reason for him to turn back. Zhou Wen pulled open the car door and sat at the passenger’s seat.</p>
<p>“I’m returning this to you.” Zhou Wen handed over the USB disk with the Sun Strafe Art.</p>
<p>After cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra, no other Primordial Energy Art could work in his body. Regardless of its authenticity, it was already meaningless to him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter48'>Chapter 48: Stepmother?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Driving forward without turning her head, An Jing said, “I never take back things I give away. If you don’t want it, you can delete it and throw it away.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed the USB disk deeper into his pocket. It wasn’t worth much, so there wasn’t any need to return to An Jing. Although he didn’t know the veracity of the Sun Strafe Art inside, it was just as An Jing said; he could just delete it.</p>
<p>The entire journey was silent, and soon, they had reached their destination.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had found Li Xuan’s villa extremely luxurious, but when he saw his destination, he realized what luxurious meant. It was like a garden itself.</p>
<p>An Jing drove the car passed an elegant and beautiful garden. There was no lack of modern style buildings, but they fused perfectly with the surrounding gardens. The contrast was perfectly balanced, clearly the work of a meticulous designer.</p>
<p>In front of a three-story building, An Jing stopped the car and took Zhou Wen straight into the building by the main door.</p>
<p>As he entered the foyer, he saw a mature, elegant woman sitting on the couch with Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>He sized up the woman and found her resembling the photo that Zhou Lingfeng had sent him. She was likely Ouyang Lan, but she looked more beautiful with a greater disposition in real life. She looked as though she was only in her thirties.</p>
<p>“Hello, Auntie,” Zhou Wen greeted. Firstly, he didn’t wish to put Zhou Lingfeng in a difficult position. Secondly, he wanted to make it clear that he didn’t treat her as his mother.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, you’re here. You look more handsome than your photographs. Your complexion just doesn’t seem too good. We happen to have cooked some ginseng soup. You should have some later. It helps.” Ouyang Lan stood up and pulled Zhou Wen’s hand, bringing him to the couch.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Auntie.” Although Zhou Wen had low EQ, he wasn’t foolish enough to reject Ouyang Lan’s well-meant intentions. He just needed to prevent making it awkward for everyone. All he wanted to do was to finish this meal before returning to game. He wanted to see if he could kill that Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan clearly was a person with very high EQ. Even though it was their first meeting, she made him very comfortable as though they had known each other for ages.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Zhou Lingfeng was someone who had the gift of the gab, but when with Ouyang Lan, his father appeared somewhat wooden. It surprised Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“These are some fresh persimmons that were delivered earlier. Little Jing, you like them the most, so try them. They’re sweet.” When Ouyang Lan seemed to realize that she had given An Jing the cold shoulder, she personally offered An Jing a succulent, enticing persimmon.</p>
<p>An Jing took it, peeled it open and took a bite. It was really sweet.</p>
<p>“Here, have another one.” Seeing An Jing finish eating it, Ouyang Lan offered her another one.</p>
<p>An Jing took the persimmon and deliberately shot a glance at Zhou Wen. Although she didn’t say a word, he could read her mind.</p>
<p>That’s what you call a real mother. An Jing seemed to say because Ouyang Lan hadn’t offered any persimmons to Zhou Wen who sat beside her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mind. Ouyang Lan was An Jing’s mother to begin with. Doting on her was only normal, so there was no reason for him to be jealous. Furthermore, he had no plans on becoming a part of the family, so there was even less reason for him to mind.</p>
<p>While Ouyang Lan and Zhou Wen were chatting, a butler came over and informed her, “Madam, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>“We’ve waited for so long. You must be hungry. Make sure you have plenty.” Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen into the dining room, making him sit beside her. An Jing could only sit somewhere farther away.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the table of dishes that were impeccable in smell and appearance, he realized that he had never seen some of the dishes. However, he was able to identify the huge lobster among them.</p>
<p>Ever since the dimensional storms, most of the sea had turned into dimensional zones. The creatures in them mutated, so seafood had become much rarer.</p>
<p>Lobsters were things that Zhou Wen had only read about in history books, biological textbooks, and on the Internet. He had never seen one in person before, much less eaten one. It was especially so in Guide City which was landlocked. There was almost no chance of eating seafood, not to mention such a huge lobster.</p>
<p>“This lobster was delivered by air this morning. I prepared it myself. Little Jing loves such lobsters the most,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>As there was only one lobster, Zhou Wen imagined that Ouyang Lan had said so as a hint that he shouldn’t fight An Jing for the lobster.</p>
<p>When An Jing heard that, she felt touched. Her icy look finally produced a smile as she looked provocatively at Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>However, the next second, Ouyang Lan said with a wistful look, “However, seafood like lobster cannot be eaten with persimmons or it will cause diarrhea. In serious cases, it might even cause food poisoning. An Jing has just had persimmons, so Little Wen, you should have the lobster. Have a taste of my culinary skills.”</p>
<p>With that said, Ouyang Lan served the lobster to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Instantly, An Jing, who was prepared to take the lobster for herself, became petrified. Zhou Wen also wore a look of shock.</p>
<p>It was deliberate, definitely deliberate… Zhou Wen was convinced that Ouyang Lan had deliberately made An Jing eat persimmons. It was clearly a trap.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Zhou Wen found it weird. With Ouyang Lan having such high EQ and there being so many persimmons on the plate, there was no way An Jing could finish them alone, so why wouldn’t the former offer him one?</p>
<p>Is she really An Jing’s mother? As Zhou Wen looked at the elegant Ouyang Lan with her beautiful features, his mind filled with questions.</p>
<p>Regardless, Ouyang Lan treated him very well. If one didn’t know them, one would imagine that Ouyang Lan was Zhou Wen’s real mother while An Jing was the stepdaughter from her husband’s previous marriage.</p>
<p>An Jing’s expression fell, but it was obvious that she had been brought up well. No matter how aggrieved she was, she didn’t stomp off in a fit. She waited until the end of the meal.</p>
<p>However, her mood was rather terrible, leading her to have a poor appetite.</p>
<p>Today, Zhou Wen acutely experienced what it meant to feel at home as a guest and the feeling of returning home.</p>
<p>Even though he was slow and distant when it came to social relations, he had to accept that it was difficult to feel irked by Ouyang Lan. He even felt willing to deepen his relationship with her.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, I heard that you’ve been admitted into Sunset College. It must have been tough, right? It’s not easy for foreign students to be admitted into Sunset College. I have nothing much I can offer you, so treat this as a meeting gift.” After the meal, when Zhou Wen was preparing to bid farewell, Ouyang Lan handed a card to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that it was a credit card or something similar. Just as he was about to decline it, he heard Ouyang Lan say, “This is a dormitory room card for Sunset College—the single room kind. I heard from Lingfeng that you enjoy some peace and quiet, so I got the principal to prepare one for you. After you matriculate, head to the dormitory according to the card number. You have to accept this tiny gift of mine. Don’t make me feel that I didn’t put too much thought into this present, alright?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Auntie. I like this gift a lot.” Zhou Wen thought about it and accepted the gift. Since it was Ouyang Lan’s gesture of goodwill, he wasn’t willing to be antagonistic about it. A dormitory card wasn’t much and a single room was indeed very useful for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan’s gift increased Zhou Wen’s impression and favorability of her. Even her gift left him feeling good. She was truly a thoughtful person.</p>
<p>“By the way, don’t call me ‘auntie’ in the future. Am I that old? Just call me Sis Lan in the future,” Ouyang Lan said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that she had enunciated the word ‘auntie’ rather clearly, making it clear that she minded such an address.</p>
<h3 id='chapter49'>Chapter 49: Silver-Winged Flying Ant</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>After leaving the An family, a chauffeur took Zhou Wen home. He didn’t see An Jing again.</p>
<p>Why would Ouyang Lan deliberately try to win my favor? With the An family’s power, there’s no need for her to do so. Zhou Wen saw that the An family’s compound had proper soldiers guarding it. This was a treatment few families in Luoyang enjoyed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t convinced that Ouyang Lan was simply trying to build better ties with him just because of Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Lingfeng left him to his own devices, so there was no need for her to do something as troublesome as this.</p>
<p>Completely perplexed at this development, Zhou Wen decided not to vex over the matter. After all, he was just a poor kid and Ouyang Lan likely couldn’t benefit much from him no matter how she schemed.</p>
<p>After returning to Li Xuan’s villa, he found it empty. Over the past few days, he seldom saw Li Xuan at home.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and took out his phone to launch the Ant Nest dungeon once more. As he had only quit the game and the blood-colored avatar remained alive, there was no need for him to waste a drop of blood to enter the game.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar appeared at the spot he had quit where there were a number of Vigor Ants crawling around him. Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Vigor Ant and got the blood-colored avatar to ride on it before storming off.</p>
<p>The Mutated Vigor Ant was just too powerful. Not even Vigor Ants posed a threat, even Mutated Vigor Ants could be cleaved apart with one swipe.</p>
<p>After leaving a wake of destruction and slaying a Mutated Vigor Ant, Zhou Wen heard a notification sound. Originally imagining that a dimensional crystal had dropped, through observation he realized it was only a Mutated Vigor Ant Egg.</p>
<p>“Discovered Mutated Vigor Ant. It has a compatibility score of 73% with the Mutated Skeleton Ant. Proceed with fusion?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose no because the last fusion hadn’t brought about any excellent effects. He had no idea if a fusion might end up making the Mutated Skeleton Ant weaker; therefore, he chose not to.</p>
<p>After choosing ‘no,’ the Mutated Vigor Ant Egg automatically entered an incubation mode. In turn, Zhou Wen felt his Primordial Energy flow towards the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>This time, the incubation was very successful without having his Primordial Energy drained. He took a look at his stats in-game and realized that he still had two Primordial Energy left.</p>
<p>After the Mutated Vigor Ant had finished incubating, it turned into an ant tattoo that appeared on the back of his right hand. Perhaps due to the Mutated Skeleton Ant on his left hand, this new Companion Beast had chosen the right.</p>
<p>Mutated Vigor Ant: Mortal</p>
<p>Strength: 7</p>
<p>Speed: 4</p>
<p>Constitution: 7</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 2</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 2)</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>This Mutated Vigor Ant’s stats are far worse than the first one. It’s not of much use to me. Unfortunately, I can’t take out things that drop in-game. Otherwise, I could sell them for money. Zhou Wen felt a little depressed.</p>
<p>Despite so, he was still happy that something had dropped. After all, this was rare to begin with.</p>
<p>Due to having his Primordial Energy expended, Zhou Wen didn’t head straight for the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. He first circled the region and killed large numbers of Vigor Ants, using the Primordial Energy Crystals that dropped to replenish his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>After refilling his Primordial Energy to 10, Zhou Wen headed for the spot where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was.</p>
<p>When he saw the Silver-Winged Flying Ant from far away, it flapped its wings and flew over, its speed so fast that it left behind after-images on the screen.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Vigor Ant and made it deal with the nearby ordinary ant horde. As for the Mutated Skeleton Ant, he had summoned it out as his Companion Form.</p>
<p>Blood-red bones appeared on his left arm as though he had an exoskeleton. It enveloped his entire left arm, including his hand, turning into a fearsome bracer.</p>
<p>The bracer could not only serve as protection, it even had quite a number of bone spikes that made it even more terrifying.</p>
<p>Almost at the instant the bracer took form, he felt a force pump into his left arm, condensing its Strength and making it more robust. He had the feeling that his single punch could blow through a mountain.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant arrived at the next instant. Its silver transparent wings rapidly flapped, streaking a curve across the air like a silver bolt of lightning. Its claw stabbed towards the blood-colored avatar’s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had fought the Silver-Winged Flying Ant multiple times, so he knew it very well. Upon seeing its actions, he knew where it was attacking. Without waiting for it to complete the attack, he took a sidestep and turned his body, using his left hand, which was protected by the bracer, to deliver an Ashen Palm strike.</p>
<p>At this close distance, with Ashen Palm’s explosive speed, Zhou Wen imagined that it was in the bag. To his surprise, silver streams of light shot out from above the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s four transparent wings.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant, which was already exceedingly fast, had its speed increase significantly. At such close proximity, Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm failed to keep up with his opponent’s speed. He was just a sliver short of hitting its body.</p>
<p>Instead, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s claw directly stabbed into the blood-colored avatar’s chest in that fluid motion. There was no chance for the latter to even struggle as it died on the spot.</p>
<p>“A flying-type Primordial Energy Skill?” Looking at the blackened screen, Zhou Wen was excited instead of being sad.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant had never used Primordial Energy Skills before. However, he had managed to force it to use it, meaning that Zhou Wen felt that he had a chance of defeating it.</p>
<p>After all, Primordial Energy Skills required Primordial Energy. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn’t keep using it. As long as he figured out a way to stall for time, it wouldn’t be impossible for him to slay it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had a flight-type Primordial Energy Skill, this was undoubtedly good news for him. They were relatively rare and were very useful.</p>
<p>With something to look forward to, Zhou Wen worked even harder. He used a syringe to draw some blood and dripped it on his screen, reviving the blood-colored avatar and immediately sending it do battle.</p>
<p>When he came in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant again, Zhou Wen lasted an additional three seconds. The third time he fought it, he used positioning and Ashen Palm that threatened the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, successfully dodging its use of the Primordial Energy Skill twice.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen exchanged the repeated deaths for combat experience as he slowly approached his goal of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Finally, he confirmed that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could only use its Primordial Energy Skill twice. This was its limit. As long as Zhou Wen could dodge the greatest threat twice, he would have the chance of defeating it.</p>
<p>During his seventh encounter with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, he successfully dodged the two critical instances and found an opportunity to deliver Ashen Palm, striking at the thin waist of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<h3 id='chapter50'>Chapter 50: Incubation Failure</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s thin waist didn’t snap. It didn’t even show signs of being injured. However, after it flew several meters away, its waist suddenly seemed to bend. Its upper body drooped down as though it lacked the strength to prop it up. After staggering for a while, it collapsed to the ground due to a lack of balance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted to see this. He immediately controlled the blood-colored avatar to rush over to deliver another Ashen Palm strike, hitting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s head.</p>
<p>After this strike, Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy was completely drained. He was unable to use Primordial Energy Skills again, but the effects of this strike were very evident. With the augmentation of the skeleton bracer and Ashen Palm’s cold, explosive might, it blasted apart the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s head. Immediately, it began going in circles as it flapped its wings.</p>
<p>Seeing it still alive, Zhou Wen threw a few more punches. However, without any Primordial Energy left, he was unable to use Primordial Energy Skills. He relied only on his Strength and the augmentation of the skeleton bracer. However, he only managed to leave the Silver-Winged Flying Ant tumbling around without dealing any serious injuries to it.</p>
<p>However, the two Ashen Palm at full might were lethal. After the Silver-Winged Flying Ant slammed around randomly, it slowly stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Killed Legendary creature, Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Discovered Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback, having never expected a Companion Egg to drop. Although the chances of a Companion Egg dropping were significantly higher for Legendary creatures, it was still a relatively low probability.</p>
<p>To have a Companion Egg drop on his first kill of a Silver-Winged Flying Ant was sheer good luck.</p>
<p>However, with this happening, Zhou Wen could only make a bet. A Legendary Companion Egg required plenty of Primordial Energy during incubation. He wasn’t necessarily capable of incubating the egg successfully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s only advantage was to use the game character to incubate. Even if he failed, it only led to the game character’s death and nothing to do with him. However, he didn’t know if the Companion Egg would still exist in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Can’t this darn game have a backpack? Let me store the Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals that I pick up in an inventory instead of having to use them immediately. Zhou Wen’s grumblings were in vain. He still got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Companion Egg. Otherwise, the Companion Egg would no longer be there once the dungeon refreshed if his in-game character were to die.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t pick it up immediately. He did some grinding on the Vigor Ants and used the dropped Primordial Energy Crystals to replenish his Primordial Energy. Only then did he pick up the Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg.</p>
<p>‘Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Mutated Skeleton Ant have a compatibility score of 21%. Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Mutated Vigor Ant have a compatibility score of 11.1%. Proceed with fusion?’</p>
<p>They are all ants, so why is the compatibility so low? The system’s notification left Zhou Wen speechless.</p>
<p>Without having the intention to change his mind, Zhou Wen chose ‘no’ before letting the Companion Egg enter the incubation mode.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt all his meridians tremble vigorously as his Primordial Energy was instantly drained, leaving not one bit behind. He felt as though he was about to die.</p>
<p>He felt a burning pain that seemed to come from an explosion across his back and couldn’t help but spew out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Without any surprises, the blood-colored avatar in-game exploded to its death, turning the screen black.</p>
<p>Indeed, even with a 10-valued Primordial Energy limit as a Mortal, using that to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast is still too demanding. Besides, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant isn’t an ordinary Legendary. Zhou Wen felt a little stifled. He had long steeled himself for the worst possible outcome, so he wasn’t too disappointed.</p>
<p>When he dripped a drop of blood and relaunched the game, he couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he looked at the stats of the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The other stats hadn’t changed, but in the Companion Beast entry, there was an additional “Silver-Winged Flying Ant.”</p>
<p>It actually managed to be incubated… Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He hadn’t held any hope, so he was surprised to see the Silver-Winged Flying Ant appear in his Companion Beast entry.</p>
<p>He hurriedly checked on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s stats. He was rather expectant of it. Other than having a slightly weaker Constitution, it was unlikely to have any other weakness.</p>
<p>More importantly, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s body shape could perhaps be used as a mount.</p>
<p>Also, with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as a Legendary Companion Beast capable of flight, he could now attempt to kill the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen saw its stats, he was taken aback. He took quite some time to recover.</p>
<p>Silver-Winged Flying Ant: Legendary (Larva State)</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: King of Low Altitudes</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Silver Wing Flash</p>
<p>Companion Form: Wings</p>
<p>Strength: 12</p>
<p>Speed: 14</p>
<p>Constitution: 10</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 11</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, its stats were clearly too weak. Among Legendary Companion Beasts, it was the weakest kind. It was even inferior to the Skeleton General and could even be said to be much worse.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant shouldn’t be this weak. Could it be because it couldn’t finish the incubation? Does this Larva State mean that it still has room for growth? Zhou Wen thought about it as he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>A silver glow appeared on the back of the blood-colored avatar before a silver flying ant flew out. The moment it appeared, Zhou Wen saw how different it was.</p>
<p>This Silver-Winged Flying Ant he had incubated was at least half the size of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant he had killed.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was bigger than a Vigor Ant to begin with and about the size of a Mutated Vigor Ant. But now, it was only about half the size of a Vigor Ant.</p>
<p>This size was definitely unsuitable for riding as it was just too small.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried turning the Silver-Winged Flying Ant into its Companion Form and saw a silver light flash. Four silver transparent wings appeared on the back of the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>However, the wings looked a little too small, extremely disproportionate to the blood-colored avatar’s size. It left Zhou Wen wondering whether such small wings could lift the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>He made an attempt and the four silver wings actually managed to allow the blood-colored avatar to fly. The speed was not bad and allowed for nimble maneuvering. However, the wings didn’t allow him to fly high. Its maximum height didn’t surpass twenty meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then had a serious look at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Life Providence’s and Talent Skill’s introduction.</p>
<p>King of Low Altitudes: Has tremendous air superiority, but can only fly at low heights. A king when it comes to low-altitude flight.</p>
<p>Silver Wing Flash: Significantly boosts flying speed for a short period of time.</p>
<p>Silver Wing Flash was as Zhou Wen expected. However, the Legendary Life Providence title of King of Low Altitudes left him depressed. This creature couldn’t fly high.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only count on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant maturing. Otherwise, with such stats, it’s unlikely to hold much of an advantage over any Legendary creature. I shouldn’t even pin my hopes on it to kill the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus. I’m just curious what needs to be done to allow the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to mature, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Companion Beast interface produced a system notification: Silver-Winged Flying Ant is currently in a hungry state. Proceed with feeding?</p>
<h3 id='chapter51'>Chapter 51: Companion Beast’s Food</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen chose ‘yes’ out of curiosity. He had no idea how feeding was done, nor did he know what Companion Beasts ate.</p>
<p>Although people would use dimensional crystals to strengthen their Companion Beasts in real life to expedite their evolution, the situation with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was somewhat different. It wasn’t evolving but growing up.</p>
<p>‘Two foods available: Mutated Vigor Ant and Mutated Skeleton Ant. Please select the food for feeding.’</p>
<p>The food is actually Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen found it extravagant. The price of any Companion Beast could feed an ordinary person for half a year; yet, this fellow was actually eating them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had no way to sell the Companion Beasts that dropped in-game. For instance, the Mutated Vigor Ant was no longer of much use, so using it as food wasn’t something to be sad about.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate as he chose the Mutated Vigor Ant as food and fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>The Mutated Vigor Ant which had been selected transformed into a swirl of light that flew towards the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. There was nothing apart from a silver flash after it had infused the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. It allowed the latter’s hungry state to disappear.</p>
<p>Having killed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, the ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants couldn’t stop the blood-colored avatar and the skeleton ant. Zhou Wen stormed forward, hoping to see what hid deeper in the Ant Nest.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant was like a tank. It left a wake of destruction through the ant swarm, but the swarm was like a terrifying tidal wave. Despite spending half an hour, he only advanced a few hundred meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he saw the underground area widen significantly. He summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and four transparent wings appeared behind the blood-colored avatar, allowing the blood-colored avatar to fly up.</p>
<p>Although it could only fly about ten meters high, it was sufficient to prevent the Vigor Ants from touching him. Besides, they were underground, so there wasn’t that much space for him to fly.</p>
<p>In fact, even if he flew higher, it wouldn’t help as there were ants crawling on the ceiling. Zhou Wen didn’t allow the blood-colored avatar to get too close.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Life Providence as King of Low Altitudes made things easier. It flew very agilely at low altitudes and even if Vigor Ants were to pounce off the ceiling towards him, he was able to easily dodge them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had hopes of encountering other Silver-Winged Flying Ants as he flew or other higher-level dimensional creatures since he was no longer satisfied killing ordinary Vigor Ants.</p>
<p>The cave became wider as he ventured deeper. Before long, the game screen suddenly opened up. An underground cavern appeared; huge beyond imagination.</p>
<p>And in that underground cavern, there were ant nests stringed together like a gigantic underground city.</p>
<p>However, these ant nests were different from human buildings. They looked like stone spheres of varying sizes with huge stone strips in between them, covering nearly half the underground space.</p>
<p>Around the ant nests’ periphery, there was a swarm of black-winged flying ants circling the area. Zhou Wen could only see the center where there was a huge spherical ant nest. Furthermore, there was a strange golden glow emitting from it.</p>
<p>The next second, Zhou Wen saw a swarm of black-winged flying ants charge at him. The blood-colored avatar didn’t even manage to put up a struggle before being overrun and dying.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the black screen, Zhou Wen quit the game. He believed that he had no means of exploring the ant city for quite some time.</p>
<p>“At the very least, I’ll have to wait until the Silver-Winged Flying Ant grows up before I have a chance of exploring the ant city. I wonder what that golden glow in the middle of the ant nest is. It doesn’t look like an ant.” Zhou Wen hadn’t had much time to observe it and since it was too far, he hadn’t managed to take a good look.</p>
<p>He happened to be hungry, so he headed to the kitchen to look for some food. He realized that Li Xuan’s fridge was empty. The only thing there was leftover pizza—moldy pizza.</p>
<p>Isn’t it a waste to have this huge refrigerator switched on all the time with nothing inside? Zhou Wen decided to buy some food. They were still a few days away from the first day of school, and he needed food for those days.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Inside a hotel suite in Luoyang City, Qiao Siyuan was carefully reading through a document.</p>
<p>A blonde, green-eyed woman, Liz, reported as she held a tablet in hand, “That youth’s information is all in here. His name is Zhou Wen, a student of Guide High School. He graduated this year and scored pretty highly. He came in second in the city for the combat test. He has already been admitted into Sunset College. His father is Zhou Lingfeng, a translator. He doesn’t have any background worth mentioning, but interestingly, Zhou Lingfeng recently remarried and his new wife is the An family’s widow, Ouyang Lan.”</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo’s mother, Ouyang Lan?” Qiao Siyuan was taken aback when he heard that as he looked up at Liz.</p>
<p>Liz smiled with a nod. “Yes, Overseer An’s mother. According to the intel, An Jing had once specially transferred to Guide High School to beat up Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan fell into deep thought after hearing that. He glared at Liz and asked, “Does Zhou Lingfeng really not have any background?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already had his background investigated. For three generations, their family has been poor. Zhou Lingfeng’s father was a carpenter. He didn’t enjoy physical labor from a young age, and due to his aptitude in language, he chose to be a translator,” Liz said as she took a look at her summary.</p>
<p>“Could it be possible that Zhou Lingfeng had made contact with people overseas?” Qiao Siyuan asked.</p>
<p>“Unlikely. Although Zhou Lingfeng has some aptitude in language, he’s quite a frivolous person. He’s gluttonous and lazy and quite lustful, often spending his time in bars. His cultivation is terrible and he only barely entered the Legendary stage a few years ago. I doubt such a person will catch the fancy of those fellows overseas, right?” Liz replied.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Why would a woman like Ouyang Lan like such a man?” Qiao Siyuan frowned.</p>
<p>“Women like a bad boy. Perhaps Ouyang Lan likes a pretty boy like Zhou Lingfeng?” Liz suggested.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan firmly shook his head. “Ouyang Lan definitely isn’t such a woman. The An family went into turmoil following An Datong’s death. An Tianzuo was only fourteen when he inherited the An family’s business. Countless important figures in the League crave what the An family has. Even members of the An family have their sights on these things, a classic case of domestic trouble and foreign invasion. For An Tianzuo to keep the family business secure to this day at such a young age, who do you think was responsible for it? With a woman as powerful as Ouyang Lan, even if she’s remarrying, why would she randomly choose such a useless man?”</p>
<p>“But we’ve already checked very carefully. The Zhou family really doesn’t have any background. Zhou Lingfeng is clean, so it’s unlikely he has any relationships with those overseas,” Liz said.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate those people overseas.” Qiao Siyuan thought and said, “Is Zhou Wen living at the Ans presently?”</p>
<p>“No. As he had teamed up with Li Xuan for the college entrance exams, they seemed to build up quite a good relationship. Therefore, he has been living at his place since he arrived in Luoyang. We failed to find him in Guide City previously because Li Xuan had brought him to Luoyang early,” Liz said.</p>
<p>“Bring Zhou Wen here. Remember not to alert anyone, especially the Ans,” Qiao Siyuan said in a deep voice.</p>
<h3 id='chapter52'>Chapter 52: Liz’s Plan</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen left Li Xuan’s place and walked along the road. It was a really nice neighborhood, but there weren’t any large-sized supermarkets. Zhou Wen navigated using his phone and discovered that the nearest supermarket was about a kilometer away.</p>
<p>Everything around here is nice except the distance needed to buy stuff. Zhou Wen wasn’t averse to walking, but he didn’t wish to waste time on walking.</p>
<p>He believed that wasting time was no different from wasting life, so he took out the mysterious phone and gamed while walking.</p>
<p>Liz, who had received Qiao Siyuan’s orders to bring Zhou Wen back, had already dispatched men to watch Li Xuan’s place.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen leave the house, a subordinate whispered, “Director Liz, shall we head over and take him away?”</p>
<p>Liz rolled her eyes. “Zhou Wen enjoys a special status. We mustn’t allow others to discover that he was taken by us. And there are cameras everywhere in that upscale neighborhood. We’d be exposed if were to directly take him away?”</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?”</p>
<p>Liz impatiently waved her hand. “Head back now. Leave this to me.”</p>
<p>After chasing away all her subordinates, Liz combed her wavy blonde hair and thought, With my charm, won’t it be a piece of cake dealing with his kid?</p>
<p>Liz wasn’t in a hurry. She waited until Zhou Wen left the upscale neighborhood before she started her red convertible sports car. When she saw a stretch of road without any cameras, she drove over.</p>
<p>She deliberately stopped her car beside Zhou Wen, and flicked her blonde hair, exposing the snow-white, supple skin of her shoulder. She then shot Zhou Wen a glance with an expectant and alluring look.</p>
<p>That kid will be groveling at my feet seeing a sports car matched with a beauty like me. Having this thought, Liz’s look and posture became even more seductive as she wore a faint mesmerizing smile.</p>
<p>But soon, her smile froze. Zhou Wen walked as he gamed on his phone, his head lowered. He didn’t even look at her and walked past the car, wasting all of her efforts to present her beauty.</p>
<p>Darn loser! Liz fumed with anger, but she still maintained her mesmerizing pose. She then shouted with a voice that could make any man swoon, “Handsome, mind giving me a hand?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Liz blinked her eyes, preparing to send his heart into a flutter. As long as Zhou Wen looked at her, she planned to sweep him head over heels.</p>
<p>Liz maintained her coquettish pose while waiting for Zhou Wen to turn around. However, he didn’t even hear her. He continued walking forward without any intention of turning back.</p>
<p>“Handsome… Handsome…” Liz resisted the urge to pull Zhou Wen back and beat him up. She deliberately shouted charmingly a few times.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was completely engrossed in his game, ignoring Liz completely. He didn’t know that Liz was shouting at him since he hadn’t heard his name.</p>
<p>Liz finally realized that her strategy had failed when she saw Zhou Wen extending the gap between them.</p>
<p>This loser… Liz gritted her teeth, adamant about not giving up. She floored the accelerator, taking the sports car in front of Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>This time, Liz didn’t make the same mistake. She got out of the car, stood in Zhou Wen’s way, putting one hand on the car. Her other hand twirled her hair as she posed in a most charming and alluring manner, accentuating her exquisite curves to the fullest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to move his gaze from the phone when he realized that something was in his way. He saw Liz when he looked up.</p>
<p>“Handsome, can you help me?” Liz asked, blinking her eyes.</p>
<p>Yes, take it in and appreciate my charm. You’ll pay in a while. Liz thought hatefully, having already prepared her lines. Once Zhou Wen answered her, she would invite him to get into the car and take him back with her.</p>
<p>“No.” However, Zhou Wen’s single-word answer instantly left Liz’s words stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>After speaking, he bowed his head and stared intently at his screen. Then he circled around Liz and walked past her.</p>
<p>The corners of Liz’s eyes twitched as flames nearly spewed out of her eyes. Plumes of fiery anger nearly tore out of her busty chest.</p>
<p>Darn loser… He actually dared ignore my charm… You’re dead… Liz thought hatefully as she turned around slowly and sat back in her car.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>The sports car’s engine roared like the rage in her heart. The red sports car was like an unbridled mare on the plains as it drove straight for Zhou Wen who was by the side of the road.</p>
<p>Since soft tactics didn’t work, Liz decided to switch tactics. She planned on taking Zhou Wen back with her by creating an accident.</p>
<p>Controlling the strength and spot to hit with a car was nothing for a peak-Legendary like Liz. If she wanted his left leg broken, there was no way his right leg would be broken.</p>
<p>I planned on having you comfortably return with me, but you just insisted on doing it the hard way. Liz floored the accelerator pedal as strange patterns surfaced over her skin. Faint swirls of light extended from her body and enveloped the car.</p>
<p>Her eyes flickered with excitement. She didn’t believe that she would miss; given the close distance, the car’s speed, her maneuvering, and Zhou Wen’s engrossment in his game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t seem to notice. He remained gaming, even when the sports car was very close to him. However, when the car ramped up the curb, Zhou Wen finally reacted and saw the sports car slamming towards him.</p>
<p>It’s too late to notice it now. Liz floored the accelerator in hate as she slammed over with the car.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to succeed, Zhou Wen’s back suddenly grew four transparent silver wings and a silver stream of light flashed over the silver wings. Zhou Wen’s figure instantly retreated in violation of the ordinary laws of physics, dodging the sports car.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The sports car missed Zhou Wen and collided with an electricity pole by the side of the road. While the pole snapped, the car’s head was dented. Components were left flying everywhere.</p>
<p>“Hello? Is this the traffic police? There’s an accident here…” Zhou Wen took out his ordinary phone and called the police hotline.</p>
<p>Liz glared at Zhou Wen viciously and reversed the car onto the road. Then, she sped off in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>What’s the brand of that car? The quality is so good. How can it still be driven after such a collision? Zhou Wen watched in astonishment as the sports car vanished from his sight, leaving a gloomy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Clearly, the sports car was targeting him instead of just having an accident. Furthermore, he had already recognized the female driver. On the night he had met Jing Daoxian, she was one of those pursuing the latter.</p>
<h3 id='chapter53'>Chapter 53: Early Matriculation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon  Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Who are these people? Since they were pursuing Jing Daoxian, it makes them either League civil servants or soldiers. But why would they drive a car to knock over an ordinary League citizen?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly frowned as he thought, I didn’t have any relationship with Jing Daoxian. Could it be that those people know that Jing Daoxian gave me the Lost Immortal Sutra and have treated me as his accomplice?</p>
<p>The more he thought about the matter, the more he found it serious. From the actions the woman had taken, those people wouldn’t stop at anything.</p>
<p>Without managing to buy his items, Zhou Wen directly turned back and gave Li Xuan a call.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, how rare it is for you to call me,” Li Xuan teased. The phone call was affected by the noisy din—a result of loud music and shouting.</p>
<p>“Find somewhere quiet. I have something to say to you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Don’t hang up.” After a while, the phone turned silent. Li Xuan’s voice then sounded. “You can tell me what’s up now.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way for me to be matriculated now?” After racking his brains, Zhou Wen believed that matriculating was the only viable solution.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, the institute was different from the universities of the past. It was especially so with Sunset College. It had close ties and history with the military and was considered a ministry department. In a law-by-law situation, it was impossible for one to enter Sunset College to apprehend someone.</p>
<p>Sunset College was a partially-restricted school. As long as he didn’t leave campus, outsiders were unable to drive into him like today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the other party being so fearless, he believed that there was a chance of implicating Li Xuan if he continued to stay at his place.</p>
<p>“No problem. I’ll settle it immediately. Can you tell me what happened? Just pretend I didn’t ask if you can’t.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of hiding the matter as he explained all that had happened, apart from his conversation with Jing Daoxian and how the Lost Immortal Sutra had been forced on him.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, you actually met Jing Daoxian?” Li Xuan exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I wish I had never met him. I’ve attracted so much trouble simply from meeting him once,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment before saying solemnly, “Wait at home for me. I’ll head back immediately. It’s best we don’t talk about certain topics over the phone.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, Zhou Wen returned to Li Xuan’s place and waited for him to return.</p>
<p>“If my guess isn’t wrong, the woman who was pursuing Jing Daoxian, and attempted to run you over in the car, likely comes from the Special Inspector Bureau.”</p>
<p>“What department is the Special Inspector Bureau? Does it come under the military or the police?” Zhou Wen had never heard of such a department.</p>
<p>“Neither,” Li Xuan said with a shake of his head. “This department specializes in special cases. It has great authority and autonomy, so they often carry out operations that do not come under the legal process. It can almost be described as unscrupulous. It does many sordid things that get covered up. There’s a lot of disagreement regarding the existence of this department in the League with many people hating it. They call the people in the department hyenas.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore a heavy look. From the name ‘hyenas,’ he knew what kind of people this department comprised of.</p>
<p>Hyenas were the most scheming, filthy, dirty animals in the natural world. To achieve their goal, they did anything, not releasing their grip once they bit down hard. Furthermore, they always appeared in packs.</p>
<p>“It’s a good idea to matriculate early. Although the Special Inspector Bureau has great authority, they are unable to flout the law openly. They can only covertly do certain deeds. It won’t be easy for them to deal with you when you stay on campus. However, there’s a need to resolve this matter ultimately. Otherwise, they will keep biting down on you and something bad will ultimately come out of it.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought before continuing, “Stay on campus now. I’ll discuss it with my father. He should be able to find people from the Special Inspector Bureau to figure out why they are targeting you. If it’s nothing too serious, we can try to think of means to resolve this matter once and for all.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t reject Li Xuan’s offer for help, but he didn’t place all his hopes on him.</p>
<p>Strength. I need greater strength. If I was as powerful as Jing Daoxian, would I be afraid of a mere Special Inspector Bureau? A cold glint flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>He could sense that the woman didn’t want his life. However, the outrageous attempt to run him over was something he wouldn’t forgive even if the Special Inspector Bureau were to close the case.</p>
<p>Li Xuan quickly finished the matriculation procedure. He claimed that since he had nothing better to do at home, he decided to matriculate early with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan wore an odd expression when he told Zhou Wen about the matter. “I originally wanted to pull strings so that we could get allocated to the same dorm. But the school’s side said that your dorm has already been assigned—Four Seasons Garden.”</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with Four Seasons Garden?” Zhou Wen had guessed that it was the dorm that Ouyang Lan was referring to. However, he had no idea why Li Xuan wore such an odd expression.</p>
<p>“Four Seasons Garden is a place where special admissions students live. They are quite different from the typical student. You were admitted just like me and not a special admit, so why were you allocated Four Seasons Garden?” Li Xuan chuckled. “From the looks of it, you have quite an extraordinary relationship with the An family. Can you help me get one at Four Seasons Garden?”</p>
<p>“If you wish to live there, can’t you just live with me? But, how are you certain that it has to do with the An family?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you aren’t aware? Sunset College was originally spearheaded and established by the An family. Although it’s a public school in name, the An family has greater say than the League President inside Sunset College.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Zhou Wen never expected that Sunset College had such a connection with the An family.</p>
<p>“You actually weren’t aware? Then what relationship do you have with the Ans?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen with a suspicious look. If Zhou Wen really had a close relationship with them, how was it that he didn’t know about it?</p>
<p>Feeling that there was no point in hiding this matter from Li Xuan, Zhou Wen said, “Zhou Lingfeng is my father.”</p>
<p>Pfft! Li Xuan spewed out all the water that he had just drunk as he widened his eyes and looked at Zhou Wen. “You are Zhou Lingfeng’s son? That makes Overseer An your stepmother. An Jing and An Tianzuo are your step-siblings? Holy sh*t, you have a huge backer with the An family or Overseer An. Why are you afraid of the Special Inspector Bureau? Once you live with the An family, even if the minister of the Special Inspector Bureau were to come, he wouldn’t even dare touch you.”</p>
<p>“That’s them. I’m me. My surname isn’t An, so we aren’t considered family. I only wish to coexist with them peacefully. It’s best if we each mind our own business.”</p>
<p>“You’re too stubborn. If I were you, I’d wheedle my way into Ouyang Lan’s good books. When that happens, I’d have whatever I want,” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“However, Four Seasons Garden is nice too. It will be difficult for the Special Inspector Bureau to deal with you if you were to live there,” Li Xuan said, feeling relaxed.</p>

<p>“I ordered you to bring back Zhou Wen secretly without alerting anyone. But what did you do? You tried to run him over with a car! Have I been too lax on all of you recently that you’ve forgotten how to abide by the rules?” Qiao Siyuan said calmly, but his eyes were rather cold.</p>
<p>Liz trembled as she quickly stood up and bowed. “Sir, I was derelict in my duty. It was thankfully not detected by the Ans. Please give me another chance. I’ll definitely bring Zhou Wen back.”</p>
<p>“Not detected?” Qiao Siyuan placed a document dossier on the desk and said calmly, “Take a look at this.”</p>
<p>“This is?” Liz opened the dossier in puzzlement and was alarmed when she read its contents. “How is this possible? It’s impossible, right? Sir, is the information in here real?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan shot a look at Liz and said slowly, “I had a feeling that Ouyang Lan’s marriage with Zhou Lingfeng was odd. I felt that it might be connected to that matter, so I deliberately requested my teacher to help me investigate the An family’s candidate. This was the outcome my teacher gave me. Do you think it could be wrong?”</p>
<p>“Naturally not!” The alarmed look on Liz’s face became more pronounced. “But isn’t the An family’s candidate An Jing? Why did it turn into Zhou Wen? He has zero blood relations with the An family and isn’t even half a son. Why would the An family give such a huge opportunity to an outsider?”</p>
<p>“That I do not know, but I can be sure that after Zhou Wen was admitted into Sunset College, the An family indeed changed their candidate’s name from An Jing to Zhou Wen. And based on the regulations, the An family only has one chance of changing their candidate. Even if Zhou Wen were to die, it would be impossible to change it to anyone else.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Qiao Siyuan glared at Liz with a burning gaze. “Do you still believe that the An family is completely unaware of your little accident with Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>Liz broke out into a cold sweat as she bowed her head. “Sir, I’m aware of my mistakes. I’m fully prepared for any punishment.”</p>
<p>She knew very well how important Zhou Wen now was to the An family. It was impossible for them not to know of such a person being hit by a car in Luoyang. If they really were so oblivious to such developments, they would have long been cleanly devoured by others.</p>
<p>“Considering how you were only recently transferred to the Special Inspector Bureau and aren’t aware of how we run things here, I’ll let this pass. Don’t repeat this a second time,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“Sir, please give me an opportunity to make up for my mistakes,” Liz requested.</p>
<p>“Not now. Zhou Wen has already headed for Sunset College early. If there’s no reasonable excuse, it won’t be that easy to invite him over. I have other arrangements, so stay out of this matter,” Qiao Siyuan said with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Liz said with an odd expression, “I really find it unbelievable that the Ans would switch their candidate to Zhou Wen. Even if Ouyang Lan were blinded by love and couldn’t be bothered about the opportunity for her daughter, how could they be agreeable to giving this opportunity to Zhou Wen? How is it possible for An Tianzuo to agree? This opportunity should belong to the Ans!”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to waste your efforts trying to understand something you don’t. Just do what you’re supposed to do. You are dismissed.” Qiao Siyuan waved his hand, an indication that Liz should leave. He then picked up the dossier and muttered to himself while reading it, “What’s the An family up to? How’s it possible for them to give such a huge opportunity to an outsider? Could it be that Ouyang Lan gave away this opportunity because she doesn’t want her daughter to take the risk? But with An Jing’s talent, the chances of her succeeding is rather high. It wouldn’t be considered risky. Is Jing Daoxian’s encounter with Zhou Wen, and the way he abnormally remained in the vicinity, purely coincidental?”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had completed the matriculation paperwork, the latter chose not to stay in Four Seasons Garden with Zhou Wen. Therefore, Zhou Wen headed to the specially designed region like a park, alone, with the dormitory card Ouyang Lan had given him.</p>
<p>There were rows of two-storied buildings which weren’t too big. They were minimalistic and simple and each building came with a tiny yard.</p>
<p>The yard didn’t have any walls. They were just surrounded by a white wooden fence that was half an adult’s height, allowing people to clearly see into their neighbors compound.</p>
<p>702. It should be this one. Zhou Wen stood in front of a small building by following the dormitory card. He looked around and realized that this was the last row in Four Seasons Garden. There were three buildings in this row, and his building was in the middle. The building on the left seemed uninhabited and the right building’s yard had some plants grown with the soil still moist. It was likely inhabited by someone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of pushing the door open to enter when he heard the door open on the building to his right. Then, he saw a figure walk out.</p>
<p>An Jing? Zhou Wen was taken aback when he identified the figure.</p>
<p>An Jing was equally taken aback, clearly not expecting to meet Zhou Wen here.</p>
<p>However, she instantly understood what was happening. Biting her lip, she ignored Zhou Wen and left her yard.</p>
<p>Since An Jing had ignored him, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on being chummy with her. Without a word, the two pretended as though they hadn’t seen the other.</p>
<p>After entering the building with his dormitory card, Zhou Wen found the place excellent. Although the layout and renovations were simple, they were very suitable for cultivation. It even came equipped with Strength-measuring devices and other useful tools.</p>
<p>A new beginning. Seems pretty good. After Zhou Wen surveyed the entire building, he planned on buying some necessities first.</p>
<p>Although the building was furnished, it didn’t come with blankets or other personal belongings. It still required Zhou Wen to buy them himself.</p>
<p>Previously, Li Xuan had taken him to the entrance of Four Seasons Garden. However, attempting to walk out himself, he realized how ridiculously huge Sunset College was. Although it wasn’t big to the point of getting lost, Zhou Wen still took several detours due to the inaccurate navigation on his phone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he wasn’t aware of where he could buy daily necessities on campus.</p>
<p>As he walked, he found himself in an increasingly remote and isolated area. Just as he was about to ask around for directions, he realized that he was surrounded by old, dilapidated buildings—likely old teaching buildings that had been abandoned.</p>
<p>How is the GPS tracking so ridiculously wrong? Zhou Wen looked at the map on his phone in exasperation.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to turn back, he heard voices from a bend ahead.</p>
<p>I should ask for directions. Zhou Wen took a few steps forward, planning to ask the talking person about the location of the on-campus supermarket.</p>
<p>“Little Mei, you have to be good. Work hard in the future.” Zhou Wen heard a man’s voice around the bend and found it somewhat familiar. However, he wasn’t able to immediately put the voice to a face.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, Zhou Wen turned the corner and saw in the corner of a dilapidated building nearby, a towering figure. He had his hands raised high, raising a petite and adorable kitten. His eyes wore a warm look as he suffused a smile. However, that face still looked as ferocious as a devil despite smiling. It left anyone who laid their eyes on him afraid.</p>
<p>Gu Dian? Zhou Wen was momentarily left rooted to the ground. He couldn’t put Gu Dian with this man who was warmly smiling and raising a kitten high up.</p>
<p>Likewise, Gu Dian noticed Zhou Wen. When his eyes locked with Zhou Wen with him raising the kitten, the atmosphere between them immediately became odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter55'>Chapter 55: Heart Meditation’s Use</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Only when Gu Dian put the kitten aside did Zhou Wen see another three cats on the grass patch to the side. Two of them were kittens and one of them was an adult. Clearly, this group of four was a family. The mother cat was sunbathing in the sun with her three kittens.</p>
<p>By the side of the grass patch were two bowls. One of them had water in it and the other had cat food. It was obvious that they had been prepared by Gu Dian.</p>
<p>After putting down the kitten, the look in Gu Dian’s eyes turned extremely cold. He glared at Zhou Wen like a devil and coldly said, “You’re dead if I hear any rumors spreading.”</p>
<p>His devil-like looks and bone-chilling voice would probably frighten Zhou Wen at any other time. However, the scene of Gu Dian raising the kitten high kept flashing across his eyes. Zhou Wen just couldn’t bring himself to feel any fear.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not a gossipy person.”</p>
<p>“That better be the case,” Gu Dian said coldly. Ignoring Zhou Wen, he bent down and picked up the two bowls. After taking another glance at the four cats who were frolicking on the grass, he turned and left.</p>
<p>After taking a few steps, Gu Dian stopped and said without turning his head. “Also, don’t you attempt to harm them; otherwise, you’re dead.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Gu Dian took huge strides and left.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said that not only does Gu Dian look fierce, but that he’s extremely bad. It’s said that he’s willing to do anything awful as long as he’s paid. Now from the looks of it, he might not be as bad as the rumors say. To be so close to cats which are naturally wary of others, to the point of letting him get so close to the kittens, he’s probably not as evil as the rumors say. Zhou Wen glanced at the four cats and thought to himself.</p>
<p>In present times, animals like dogs and cats were no longer as cherished as in the past. After all, they were only for aesthetics. In contrast, Companion Beasts had magical powers. People were more willing to spend money on them.</p>
<p>In the past, all kinds of valuable pet cats and dogs had mostly turned into strays. They were no longer doted on by humans.</p>
<p>With the time changing, many things changed as well. In the past, figures who could fly or have tremendous strength were extolled for being capable of becoming Legendaries. Their tales were spread to this day because few humans in the past had such powers.</p>
<p>But in this day and age, it wasn’t difficult to have tremendous strength if one could advance to the Legendary stage. Now, almost everyone could become as legendary as those people from the past since the Legendary stage was no longer rare. As long as one cultivated hard, they would definitely advance to the Legendary stage as long as they weren’t without any aptitude.</p>
<p>However, to advance from the Legendary stage to the Epic stage wasn’t simple. This required talent, Primordial Energy Arts, resources, and the combination of all kinds of factors. It wasn’t achievable simply through hard work.</p>
<p>After all, those people who had their names put into the annals of history to be extolled in poems and songs were basically close to mythical existences.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen cultivated Ascetic Meditation, he had planned on advancing to the Legendary stage during college. Such a speed made him a genius among humans.</p>
<p>However, his Ascetic Meditation had already been replaced by the Legendary stage. To advance to the Legendary stage with the Lost Immortal Sutra wasn’t a simple endeavor to begin with.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been repeatedly studying Lost Immortal Sutra recently and he discovered that it was very different from the typical Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>In typical Primordial Energy Arts like Ascetic Meditation, advancement was in fact breaking one’s shackles. Humans had the limits of their Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Primordial Energy shackled, so consuming no amount of supplements was of any use. The stats just wouldn’t continue rising.</p>
<p>Only after breaking those shackles would a human’s upper limits be unlocked. While being able to continue raising one’s stats, one would also obtain a Life Providence that was related to one’s aptitude. It was commonly known as Legendary Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen’s repeated studies of the Lost Immortal Sutra, he didn’t see any descriptions regarding the breaking of those shackles.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen still hadn’t figured out how he could use the Lost Immortal Sutra to advance to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>After going through quite a hassle to find the on-campus supermarket and buying the daily necessities he needed, he returned to his dorm to unpack it. Once he was done with all of that, he then began grinding.</p>
<p>Since it was unlikely for him to have any progress with Ant Nest any time soon, Zhou Wen chose to enter the Underground Buddha City.</p>
<p>He spent some time grinding the Buddha Heart Lotuses at the lotus pond, but not a single Companion Beast dropped. Instead, his Mutated Skeleton Ant was devoured by the gargantuan blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then controlled the blood-colored avatar to Small Buddha Temple. Before climbing up the stone steps, Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to activate his Primordial Energy Skill—Heart Meditation.</p>
<p>The stretch of road in front of Small Buddha Temple was extremely bizarre. Death seemed to be the only outcome no matter how he traversed it. He still hadn’t found the reason why that was the case.</p>
<p>Using Heart Meditation was a last-ditch effort. He felt that since Heart Meditation came from the Buddha Heart Lotus, it was possible that using it worked.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the blood-colored avatar, which would usually die once it arrived at a spot where it could see the Small Buddha Temple’s signboard, didn’t die this time. It could still move higher and progress forward.</p>
<p>Does Heart Meditation really work? Even Zhou Wen was surprised.</p>
<p>He made the blood-colored avatar proceed forward and indeed, nothing happened the entire way. However, Heart Meditation was a Primordial Energy Skill which expended Primordial Energy while it was in use, at a rate of two points a minute.</p>
<p>By climbing up the stone steps in such a way, there was still quite a distance from Small Buddha Temple before his Primordial Energy was completely drained.</p>
<p>The moment Heart Meditation wasn’t in effect, the blood-colored avatar collapsed to the ground and the game’s screen went black.</p>
<p>Since he knew that Heart Meditation worked, Zhou Wen eagerly revived the blood-colored avatar and made it come in front of the Small Buddha Temple’s stone passageway.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen activated Heart Meditation and made the blood-colored avatar run towards the Small Buddha Temple at full speed. However, it died once again when its Primordial Energy was drained about ten meters away from its destination.</p>
<p>With my present speed, the time Heart Meditation can be in effect isn’t enough for me to rush into Small Buddha Temple. Do I have to wait until I’ve advanced to the Legendary stage and have plenty of Primordial Energy before I can rush in with Heart Meditation? But I’ve no idea how long it will take before I advance to the Legendary stage…</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skills like Heart Meditation that continuously expend Primordial Energy expend less Primordial Energy at higher ranks. I wonder if it’s the same with Heart Meditation? Currently, Heart Meditation is at Rank 7. If I can grind a Rank 8 or Rank 9 Heart Meditation, perhaps I might have a chance of entering Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>Since he had nothing else to do, Zhou Wen continued grinding Buddha Heart Lotuses with a try-and-see attitude, hoping to receive something.</p>
<p>After repeated grinding, Zhou Wen realized a pattern. The blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus was always submerged underwater in the beginning. Only after Zhou Wen cleaved some of the Buddha Heart Lotuses around the middle of the lotus pond would the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus rise above the water surface in rage.</p>
<h3 id='chapter56'>Chapter 56: Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon</h5>
<p>With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s wings, Zhou Wen flew directly above the lotus pond to battle the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus. Although he died plenty of times, it wasn’t without return.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather familiar with the few moves available to the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus—knowledge he had gained from repeated deaths. Although he was temporarily unable to slay it, he knew of a way to kill it. He just wasn’t powerful enough; thus, preventing him from actualizing his strategies.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, quickly get up. It’s great that we matriculated early. Otherwise, we would have missed a great show.” Li Xuan called him on the phone early in the morning.</p>
<p>“What great show?” Zhou Wen put down the phone and stretched before asking.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I mention that the Legendary stage students are purchasing powerful Companion Beasts capable of flight? They plan on slaying the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus today. Let’s head over to take a look,” Li Xuan suggested.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen was also interested in watching battles at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>He got out of bed, washed up, and headed out, meeting Li Xuan at the entrance of the Four Seasons Garden.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had clearly been waiting for a while, pulling him to head for Ancient Inlet the moment he saw Zhou Wen come out. As they ran, he said, “Quick! We’ll miss the show if we are late.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen learned from Li Xuan that the person who planned on killing the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus was a famous third-year senior in Sunset College, Yang Lie. He was a mighty figure who had advanced to the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Apparently, he had spent a large sum of money buying Legendary Companion Eggs and had tried means to speed up the incubation in order to slay the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus. As soon as that was done, he rushed for the lotus pond.</p>
<p>After the two entered Underground Buddha City, they rushed to the lotus pond, where there were many students surrounding the pond. They had clearly heard the news and were here to watch Yang Lie battle the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>Just as the duo arrived, a man ran over.</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, Brother Wen!”</p>
<p>“Xu Miantu, you also applied for Sunset College?” Zhou Wen recognized the person.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu scratched his head in embarrassment, seemingly unable to verbalize his reasons. By the side, Li Xuan scolded him in a bemused state, “Dude, just say it. It’s not like it’s something disgraceful. In fact, Xu Miantu should have been matriculated last year. However, to help me in the examination, he deferred his application to Sunset College by one year.”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu chuckled and said, “A genius like Brother Xuan didn’t even need my help. I was just ignorant.”</p>
<p>Just as the trio began having a conversation, they heard an uproar.</p>
<p>“An Jing’s here.”</p>
<p>“An Jing from the An family?”</p>
<p>“Who else could it be? Tsk, she indeed lives up to the rumors. She’s really a beauty.”</p>
<p>“I heard that she advanced to the Legendary stage at the age of thirteen. She’s extremely talented and she comes from a formidable family. She has the money, the talent, and the looks. It’s like the Creator favored her when creating her.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traced the students’ gaze and looked over. Indeed, he saw An Jing arriving on a white horse. However, it didn’t have any wings, so it wasn’t a White-Winged Flying Horse.</p>
<p>Yang Lie, who had been surrounded by people, walked over to An Jing.</p>
<p>This gave Zhou Wen a chance to see him. He stood at more than 1.80 meters. His sword-like brows and starry eyes made him look sharp. Beside him was a black leopard with one eye, making it look extremely odd.</p>
<p>“An Jing, you came just in time. Regardless of what drops today when I slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, I’ll be giving it to you as a matriculation gift,” Yang Lie said with a spirited look.</p>
<p>Many students revealed a teasing smile when they heard him. It was obvious that Yang Lie was expressing his interest in An Jing.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan said in contempt, “Although the Yang family is rather famous in Luoyang, it’s not of the upper class. Besides, they have many businesses that rely on the An family’s power in Luoyang. This punk is probably up to no good by expressing his interest in An Jing. However, it’s probably in vain. No matter how blind the An family is, they wouldn’t fancy the Yang family.”</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, I believe you are the only one qualified to be with An Jing in all of Luoyang,” Xu Miantu said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Li Xuan spat at that thought and said, “An Jing is an arrogant woman. She also has a bad temper. That cold demeanor of hers isn’t fun at all, so it’s useless no matter how beautiful she is. Only an idiot will marry a woman like her.”</p>
<p>With that said, Li Xuan glanced at Zhou Wen and said with a mysterious, furtive smile, “Besides, I understand the rationale of not hitting on a friend’s sister.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to refute and he pretended not to hear it.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu had no idea of Zhou Wen’s relationship with the An family, so he failed to understand what Li Xuan meant. Puzzled, he looked at them blankly.</p>
<p>An Jing sat on the white horse with no intention of getting off. She said in a calm tone, “I don’t need any gifts. Besides, you won’t be able to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus either.”</p>
<p>Yang Lie wasn’t angry when he heard that. Instead, he guffawed and said, “Then let’s have a bet. Why don’t you accept my present if I succeed in slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?”</p>
<p>“No,” An Jing replied without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“You’re afraid of losing?” Yang Lie said provocatively.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so the bet can’t even be established. There’s no need for it.” After An Jing said that, she rode the white horse to the side of the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Yang Lie felt embarrassed, but due to her extremely special identity, he didn’t dare flare up at her.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll show you that I’m capable of slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus,” Yang Lie said. He spread his arms and two Companion Beasts were summoned out by him.</p>
<p>They were two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks, but they were much larger than the typical hawk. Their wingspans reached more than ten meters and with a flap, they shot out like a golden beam of light. They then spiraled above the lotus pond like two golden clouds.</p>
<p>A Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk swooped down and extended its claws like a phantom, instantly grabbing a Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>“Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk. And there’s two of them. This fellow sure is willing to make the investment,” Li Xuan curled his lips and said.</p>
<p>Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks were rare Legendary Companion Beasts. They were only found in the dimensional zones of the Heavenly Lake of the Heavenly Mountain. However, there were many dimensional zones in the Heavenly Mountain’s vicinity, so it wasn’t easy to reach the Heavenly Lake itself. Furthermore, Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks were rare in number. They also lived on cliffs, making it difficult to kill them and have a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>If one’s luck wasn’t good, even experts at the Epic stage would return empty-handed.</p>
<p>Seeing the students look at his pair of Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks in envy, Yang Lie felt slightly pleased with himself. Without any hesitation, he ordered the hawks to attack the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>When they rushed at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus from the flanks, the latter sensed the threat and shot out twenty to thirty blood-colored lotus seeds that hurtled towards the two hawks.</p>
<p>As the blood-colored lotus seeds were about to hit the hawks, they showed no intention of dodging. They continued flying forward and released a golden glow over their feathers as though they were emitting light themselves.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>When the blood-colored lotus seeds exploded on the golden feathers and splattered into bloody water, they rolled off as if the golden feathers were nonstick. The hawks weren’t damaged at all.</p>
<h3 id='chapter57'>Chapter 57 Quarrel</h3>
<p>“As expected of Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks. They are truly extraordinary. It appears this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus will likely be slain by Yang Lie,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and whispered, “Not necessarily. The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus can’t be slain by just two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s research on the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was nothing these students could compare with. He was acutely aware of how powerful the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was. It was impossible to slay it with just two Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight.</p>
<p>Perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, An Jing happened to shoot Zhou Wen a look when he said those words.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was just about to ask why when the lotus pond experienced an anomaly. One of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk rushed right in front of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and was swallowed by the latter’s petals that opened like a gaping mouth.</p>
<p>Just as the other Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk was about touch the petals with its talons that were glimmering in gold light, the blood patterns on the petals-a sitting Buddha-shot out beams of sanguine light. What seemed like a fragile petal remained undamaged after clashing with the hawk’s talons.</p>
<p>When the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus opened its petals again, the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk which had been devoured was reduced to bone. Furthermore, the bones were rapidly melting.</p>
<p>The students watching this battle gasped. It was shocking that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus could devour the Legendary Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk and instantly corrode its bones.</p>
<p>It even managed to resist the Golden Halo Talons of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk, a Primordial Energy Skill. It was quite shocking.</p>
<p>Flower-type dimensional creatures typically were rather weak in Constitution. Amongst dimensional creatures of the same stage, their Constitution usually lined the bottom.</p>
<p>However, the fact that this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was able to withstand a powerful Legendary Primordial Energy Skill like Golden Halo Talons made it terrifying. It overturned the average person’s understanding of flower-type creatures.</p>
<p>Yang Lie’s expression was livid. He didn’t dare order his Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk to continue attacking as he summoned the surviving one back.</p>
<p>All the students looked at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with fear and greed. It clearly had more than one Primordial Energy Skill. If it dropped as a Companion Beast, they could possess a Companion Beast with more than one Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>However, the chances of Companion Beasts dropping were low to begin with. Furthermore, with Yang Lie’s two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks suffering a defeat, it meant that no student could currently kill it.</p>
<p>“How did you know that the two Hawks weren’t a match for the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?” Only then did Li Xuan have the chance to ask the question that was eating at him.</p>
<p>“It was obvious to the eye.” Zhou Wen shrugged, preparing to leave the area. It was unlikely that the students could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus anytime soon. This lotus flower was probably a top existence among Legendary creatures. Unless one had even more powerful Companion Beasts or was capable of targeting its weak points, even a siege against it wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>“Brother Wen, since you were able to tell that the Hawks weren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match, doesn’t that mean that you have the means to kill it?” Xu Miantu’s eyes lit up as he asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu wasn’t much to speak of. He wasn’t a bad man either, but he was someone who shot his mouth off. He hadn’t suppressed his voice, allowing people around them to hear him.</p>
<p>Yang Lie was already in a bad mood, so when he heard Xu Miantu, he turned his head and saw that it was Li Xuan, Xu Miantu, and an unfamiliar youth, he immediately felt even more infuriated.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was well known to be a foppish person in Luoyang. Together with an adopted son of the Li family, Xu Miantu, Yang Lie naturally knew how much they amounted to. It could even be said that he viewed them with contempt.</p>
<p>Yang Lie often imagined that if he were Li Xuan and had all the resources of the Li family, he would be able to achieve so much more.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu’s unintentional question sounded like a mockery to Yang Lie.</p>
<p>“To be able to tell at a glance that the hawks aren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match. Not a bad eye. Might I know how you should be addressed?” Yang Lie held back his anger and asked Zhou Wen as he sized him up.</p>
<p>Although he was angry, he wasn’t willing to offend students with significant backing. After all, the students of Sunset College were the elites of East District. Many of them had strong backers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, but Xu Miantu drummed up support for him. “Zhou Wen got second in the combat test of Guide City. He’s the number one genius of Guide High School. He’s Brother Xuan’s buddy!”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu didn’t brag emptily but was trying to use this opportunity to make Zhou Wen known to all, making students of Sunset College know of his existence.</p>
<p>This brought about plenty of benefits. In the future, when they formed teams to enter dimensional zones to complete the missions handed out by the school, other strong students would be willing to team up with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if Zhou Wen was unknown to everyone, how would those strong students be willing to team up with him? It was already a very common way of societal thinking for the strong to ally together.</p>
<p>However, those who heard Xu Miantu looked at him and Zhou Wen with a look of mockery. It wasn’t only Yang Lie, but all the other students as well.</p>
<p>Many students in Sunset College had the accolades of being the number one genius of so-and-so high school or first in the combat test of so-and-so city. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had only gotten second place. Others weren’t even interested in who got first place, much less second place.</p>
<p>If it were first place in places like Beijing, people might have paid some attention. However, a tiny city like Guide City wasn’t worth paying any attention to.</p>
<p>When Yang Lie heard that Zhou Wen had come in second at the Guide City’s combat test, he knew that Zhou Wen likely didn’t have much of a background. Otherwise, he would have obtained first place. Only those who obtained the first place of a city could receive certain privileges and resources from the Sunset College. This was also one of the reasons why Li Xuan needed to get first.</p>
<p>“Second place. That’s pretty impressive,” Yang Lie quipped. “In that case, I would like to know what amazing strategy you have to kill that blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.”</p>
<p>The other students could naturally tell that Yang Lie was being sarcastic. They were freshmen and only at the Mortal stage. They weren’t even close to the Legendary stage, so it was obvious that they didn’t have the qualifications to kill top Legendary creatures like the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu couldn’t tolerate the treatment as he curled his lips and said in disdain, “Are you a fool or do you think of us as fools? Why should we tell you the strategy we’ve come up with?”</p>
<p>Ever since the battle at Guide Ancient City, Xu Miantu was truly impressed with Zhou Wen. He strongly believed that Zhou Wen had the means to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Since it was a given, he naturally wouldn’t tell others of the strategy.</p>
<p>But his words only amused Yang Lie. “Alright. There’s no need to tell me. Don’t you have the strategy? Isn’t being second in Guide City impressive? Fine then, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Please broaden our horizons.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter58'>Chapter 58 The Opportunity to Slay the Blood-Patterned Buddha Heart Lotus</h3>
<p>Xu Miantu didn’t dare make the decision as he cast his gaze at Zhou Wen. There was a fervent look of encouragement in it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only smile wryly in secret. Xu Miantu had thought too highly of him. He didn’t have the strength to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus at present. All he could do was slightly shake his head at Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>However, Xu Miantu had full confidence in him. Believing that Zhou Wen was only being humble, he continued encouraging him. “Brother Wen, there’s no need to be overly humble in a place like Sunset College. You have to showcase your absolute strength. This will give you the opportunity to obtain more resources.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. He did wish to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, but he really wasn’t capable of doing so at present.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen show a stumped look, Yang Lie sneered and said, “One needs to have the strength to actually showcase it. Otherwise, they will only be a joke.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Yang Lie ignored Xu Miantu and turned to walk to An Jing.</p>
<p>From Yang Lie’s point of view, he would only disgrace himself if he continued embroiling himself with Xu Miantu, Li Xuan, and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Xu Miantu didn’t wish to let it go, he was helpless when he saw Zhou Wen remain silent. All he could do was watch the supercilious look Yang Lie had while turning around.</p>
<p>Yang Lie came in front of An Jing and said in a very gentlemanly manner, “I lost the bet. If you have anything you need me to do, I’ll definitely give my all. However, I’m curious why you knew that the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match? Could it be that you’ve already fought it before?”</p>
<p>“First, I’d said that the bet was completely meaningless. Neither do I have anything I need you to do. I am equally capable of doing what you are capable of. If I can’t do it, it only makes it impossible for you to do it. Second, those who are truly in the know do not need to engage in a fight to know who’s stronger.” An Jing wore a calm look, but every word she said was biting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suspected that with her vicious tongue, she might have been beaten up by many if she hadn’t been born into the An family.</p>
<p>Indeed, Yang Lie wore a rather embarrassed look. His face oscillated between blue and white. He was a student who wasn’t even twenty years old, so he wasn’t thick-skinned enough.</p>
<p>“Well said.” Xu Miantu took this opportunity and cheered. This only made Yang Lie glare at him hatefully.</p>
<p>An Jing ignored him and rode her white horse, brushing past Yang Lie’s shoulder. She headed for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Your sister is coming over,” Li Xuan whispered as he nudged Zhou Wen with his elbow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head, gesturing to Li Xuan to cut the nonsense. However, before he could say a thing, An Jing had already arrived in front of him.</p>
<p>When Yang Lie and the other students saw An Jing standing in front of Zhou Wen, all of them cast their gazes over, curious as to what she wanted.</p>
<p>An Jing stared into Zhou Wen’s eyes and asked, “Do you have the confidence in slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?”</p>
<p>“It definitely won’t be a problem. An Jing, let’s work together to slay this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Brother Wen will definitely not let you down.” Xu Miantu didn’t know the relationship between An Jing and Zhou Wen. Imagining that An Jing was interested in Zhou Wen, he believed that Zhou Wen might be able to sweep her off her feet if he did well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this beauty’s family was extraordinary. She was the daughter of Luoyang’s An family. She was practically a princess in Luoyang.</p>
<p>“Is that right? Brother Wen?” Xu Miantu nudged Zhou Wen as he winked at him while his back was facing An Jing. His meaning was clear-he wanted Zhou Wen to do a good job.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen knew that Xu Miantu had good intentions, he really couldn’t do it. All he wanted was to game in peace and he had no intention of stealing the limelight here. Involving himself with An Jing was the last thing he wished to do.</p>
<p>“You really have wild ideas. If An Jing really wants to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, would you have even have a chance?” Yang Lie already detested Xu Miantu, so he couldn’t help but shoot off a snide remark. He vented all the pent up anger he had thanks to An Jing on Xu Miantu. “A dog is a dog. It only knows how to threaten others thanks to its master. However, you have to at least take a good look. Is that really your master?”</p>
<p>When Yang Lie said that, not only did the expression on Xu Miantu’s face change, even Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were no exception.</p>
<p>Li Xuan coldly said, “Yang Lie, who did you say was the dog? I dare you to say it again.”</p>
<p>Yang Lie sneered and said, “Who in Luoyang City doesn’t know that your patriarch enjoys adopting sons. To put it nicely, it’s an adopted son, but at the core of the matter, it’s just a lapdog reared by your Li family. This is known by all, so what did I say wrong?”</p>
<p>The look in Li Xuan’s chilled. Just as he was about to flare up, he was held back by Xu Miantu. Surprisingly, Xu Miantu wasn’t angry. He grinned at Yang Lie and said, “That’s right. I’m a dog of the Li family. I even feel proud and honored being the Li family’s dog. The Li family is my benefactor and I’ve benefited from them. It’s not like someone who yearns to be the dog of the An family, but they can’t even be bothered to spare him a glance. Something that’s worse than a dog isn’t worth mentioning.”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu’s words hit Yang Lie where it hurt. It was true that the Yang family was trying to cozy up with the An family, but the An family’s attitude was rather vague. It had never truly accepted the Yang family.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yang Lie’s expression changed drastically once he heard that. His face was extremely livid. His eyes stared viciously at Xu Miantu as a look of killing intent flashed through them.</p>
<p>“Does a dog of the Li family only know how to bark? If you’re as impressive as you say you are, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus; otherwise, quit the barking,” Yang Lie said with a cold look. If they weren’t in public, he would have immediately taken action and slaughtered Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu was about to snap back when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Then, he heard Zhou Wen whisper, “If you wish to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, we can do it together.”</p>
<p>“Brother Wen, really?” Xu Miantu was delighted as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly and said seriously, “As long as you aren’t afraid of sacrificing your Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu had started the conflict because of Zhou Wen and Yang Lie, so naturally, he couldn’t sit idly as Xu Miantu was being ridiculed by Yang Lie. However, his claim of being able to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus wasn’t just a spur of the moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really couldn’t kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in-game, but this wasn’t the game. He didn’t need to face it alone and he still had Xu Miantu and Li Xuan to help him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had carefully run through the Companion Beasts they possessed. If they controlled them well and no mistakes happened, he believed he could slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus based on his understanding of it.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of. Let’s do it,” Xu Miantu turned to say to Yang Lie. “Heard that, Yang? We’ll be slaying it right now. Open your eyes and watch it well. Don’t blame us for not teaching you.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to it,” Yang Lie said with a sneer.</p>
<p>From his point of view, it was fool’s talk that the trio could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Even two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren’t a match for it, so it would be ridiculous if three freshmen at the Mortal stage could slay it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter59'>Chapter 59 Besieging the Buddha Heart Lotus</h3>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were amongst the first group of people who had discovered the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Zhou Wen had been thinking up a strategy to slay it in-game. Likewise, Li Xuan hadn’t been slacking off either. He had also tried all kinds of means to obtain Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight, hoping to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>However, Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight were rare. Those with considerable strength weren’t easily acquired. Furthermore, Li Xuan was only at the Mortal stage, so the Legendary Companion Beasts he incubated needed more time and effort than those at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>At this point in time, Li Xuan had only incubated a Legendary Sky Conch.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu was also at the Mortal stage. He didn’t have the Invincible Connate Divine Art, so he wasn’t capable of incubating a Legendary Companion Beast. However, he had always been Li Xuan’s right-hand man. He had also contributed when Jiang Hao betrayed Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Therefore, Li Xuan had gotten a Mortal Dragon-Scaled Turtle Companion Egg and given it to him. Although it was only at the Mortal stage, it lived in Black Dragon Pool, so it had extremely high resistance against corrosive liquids.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had prepared a Dragon-Scaled Turtle to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so it was perfect to have Xu Miantu control it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew of this, so after taking into account all the Companion Beasts they had, he had the confidence that the three of them combined could kill it.</p>
<p>“To kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, apart from letting our Companion Beasts engage in battle, we will need to enter the lotus pond as well. Only then will we have a hundred percent chance of killing it. Are you certain that you want to enter?” Zhou Wen looked at Xu Miantu and Li Xuan, confirming with them with great solemnity.</p>
<p>“Buddha needs incense, and a man needs self-respect. I’m bent on killing that blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus,” Xu Miantu said loudly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, how confident are you?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen with a serious look.</p>
<p>“Follow my instructions, 100%. However, there mustn’t be any mistakes in our cooperation or it will be very dangerous. It’s especially so for Miantu who has to control the Dragon-Scaled Turtle. You mustn’t make any mistakes or both you and I will be in grave danger,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll make sure nothing happens to you even if I were to die,” Xu Miantu said as he slapped his chest.</p>
<p>“Alright. Let’s do it,” Li Xuan locked eyes with Zhou Wen and said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Then let’s begin. Listen to my every command. Miantu, release your Dragon-Scaled Turtle…” Zhou Wen softly informed the other two of his plan.</p>
<p>The trio made their own preparations. Xu Miantu released the Dragon-Scaled Turtle and a turtle the size of a tiny boat appeared on the lotus pond. Not only did it have a turtle shell, but it also had black scales on its shell, making it look very odd.</p>
<p>The average Companion Beast would immediately be reduced to bone upon contact with the lotus pond’s water. Yet, this Dragon-Scaled Turtle was completely fine. It floated in the lotus pond like a tiny black boat.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu and Li Xuan jumped onto the turtle’s back. Zhou Wen was about to jump onto it when he suddenly heard a cold, clear voice. “Good intentions might not result in good outcomes. At times, good intentions might even kill.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and looked over to see An Jing sitting on her white horse with a cold expression. She had been the one who had said that sentence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shot a look at her and smiled before jumping on the turtle’s back.</p>
<p>The Dragon-Scaled Turtle waded through the lake and the green lotus leaves, rapidly approaching the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. When it was nearly twenty meters from the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen got Xu Miantu to stop the Dragon-Scaled Turtle.</p>
<p>“Miantu, stay here to wait for us. Make sure to constantly take note of Li Xuan’s landing points. Follow the plan. Make sure nothing goes wrong,” Zhou Wen told Xu Miantu again.</p>
<p>“Brother Wen, don’t worry. As long as I’m not dead, I guarantee you that nothing bad will happen to the two of you,” Xu Miantu guaranteed with a slap of his chest.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Zhou Wen nodded and looked at Li Xuan. “Act according to plan.”</p>
<p>After uttering a confirmation, Li Xuan summoned his Legendary Companion Beast, the Sky Conch.</p>
<p>The Sky Conch resembled a conch that was found in the sea, but it had a pair of wings. Its body was about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. It was extremely stable while flying in midair. Although it flew very slowly, it was good at being able to glide in the sky for long periods of time without needing to land on the ground to continue its flight.</p>
<p>“Legendary Sky Conch? How is it possible? Isn’t Li Xuan at the Mortal stage? How is it possible for him to incubate a Sky Conch?” One of the students on the bank immediately recognized the Sky Conch and couldn’t help but exclaim.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you making too much of a fuss?” Li Xuan chuckled as he summoned Black Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger.</p>
<p>Black Knight transformed into an armor that encased Li Xuan’s body. As for the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, it turned into a Tiger Soul Saber. Its cold glimmers stirred one’s soul. Embedded in the saber’s handle was a gem resembling a tiger’s eye.</p>
<p>“Black Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger. They are both Legendary Companion Beasts… Heavens… Isn’t Li Xuan at the Mortal stage? What’s going on? Is this fellow really that prodigal son of the Li family?” The students widened their eyes as they looked at him in disbelief.</p>
<p>Li Xuan felt a little pleased with himself. Wearing the black armor and holding the Tiger Soul Saber while riding a Sky Conch, he flew towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with tremendous pomp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to pale in comparison. He summoned the Mutated Skeleton Ant and stood on its back without any weapons or armor. The Mutated Skeleton Ant waded across the water surface to another side of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>“Miantu, pay attention to Li Xuan more. Make sure he doesn’t fall into the water,” Zhou Wen looked at Xu Miantu urging him again.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Brother Wen,” Xu Miantu said with a slap on his chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t speak further. The Mutated Skeleton Ant and Sky Conch closed in on the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus from both sides. With Li Xuan’s speed faster than Zhou Wen’s, the latter had apparently deliberately stayed a little behind.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds shot at Li Xuan, instantly blanketing him and the Sky Conch, sealing off all routes of retreat.</p>
<p>With a loud roar, Li Xuan slashed the Tiger Soul Saber at the blood-colored lotus seeds. The saber was so fast that the seeds didn’t explode when they were halved.</p>
<p>The seed only exploded when both halves had flown out further than a meter.</p>
<p>“Is that really the Li family’s foppish Third Young Master Li Xuan?” Yang Lie watched in astonishment as Li Xuan showed his prowess. He sliced through all the blood-colored lotus seeds and charged at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>And while Li Xuan was handling the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s attacks, Zhou Wen took the chance to order the Mutated Skeleton Ant to rush towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus at full speed.</p>
<p>When he was less than three meters from the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen ordered the Mutated Skeleton Ant to jump. And it was at this moment that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus spread open its petals in a bid to devour the Mutated Skeleton Ant. If the latter had been one bit slower, Zhou Wen and the Mutated Skeleton Ant would have been devoured.</p>
<p>“Right now!” Zhou Wen roared.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t hesitate to jump from the Sky Conch, slashing down at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with two hands clasping the saber.</p>
<p>A blinding-white saber beam blasted out of the Tiger Soul Saber, instantly cleaving the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s petals. The petals shot out a red luster that attempted to resist the Tiger Soul Saber’s strike.</p>
<p>However, the saber beam was just too sharp. Combined with Li Xuan’s saber-type Primordial Energy Skill, the Tiger Soul Saber sliced through the petals.</p>
<p>The petal was cleaved open, revealing the black lotus receptacle. Crouching on it was a pitch-black toad covered in black venomous warts. It opened its mouth and spat a mouthful of venom at Li Xuan.</p>
<h3 id='chapter60'>Chapter 60 Atonement</h3>
<p>Li Xuan’s strength was used up by the time his cleave tore through the Buddha-patterned flower petals. Furthermore, he wasn’t able to dodge in midair. The Sky Conch was too slow at flying, making it unable to keep up with Li Xuan. It was still gliding at a relatively high altitude and the direction in which it was heading wasn’t towards Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Suddenly a fist appeared beneath Li Xuan’s feet, striking his soles. Zhou Wen had come flying over!</p>
<p>Li Xuan exerted Strength in his feet as he stepped onto Zhou Wen’s fists and used this as an impetus to soar high into the sky. Zhou Wen ended up plummeting rapidly, allowing them to dodge the toad’s venomous shot.</p>
<p>Li Xuan used his momentum to leap onto the lotus receptacle and cleaved down at the venomous toad’s head. After the saber beam flashed by, Li Xuan flew back in retreat, jumping out of the lotus receptacle.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The venomous toad exploded like a bomb, splattering venomous liquid in every direction like flying arrows, covering a massive region.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was already unable to dodge the attack while in midair, but the Sky Conch which had been constantly in the sky arrived in the nick of time, putting its body in between Li Xuan and the venomous liquid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also landed on the Mutated Skeleton Ant before leaping up once again, jumping back tens of feet to dodge the range of the venom’s splash.</p>
<p>The venom was extremely terrifying. The Sky Conch’s body was immediately corroded like snow touching ember. With a tragic cry, it fell straight into the pond.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen landed, the Mutated Skeleton Ant had already stopped beneath his feet. On the contrary, Li Xuan was plummeting straight into the pond without having any place to land his feet.</p>
<p>The Dragon-Scaled Turtle, which was meant to catch Li Xuan, was still a distance from Li Xuan under Xu Miantu’s flustered commandeering. It was apparent that he wasn’t going to arrive in time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just landed on the Mutated Skeleton Ant and it was already too late for him to command it to rush over when he saw this scene. He stomped on the Mutated Skeleton Ant and flew across the pond for Li Xuan, pulling him up just as his back was about to touch the water.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s leap was ultimately limited. He soon began falling.</p>
<p>“Miantu, what are you waiting for? Quick catch us!” Li Xuan, who had been pulled up by Zhou Wen, shouted at the nearby Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>Xu Miantu watched Zhou Wen and Li Xuan fall from about three to four meters away. He was likely to able to reach the two of them if he extended his arms while getting the Dragon-Scaled Turtle to speed up.</p>
<p>However, he stood there motionless. He clenched his teeth in silence as his forehead’s veins throbbed. Ultimately, he chose not to do a thing</p>
<p>“Xu Miantu, why!?” Li Xuan wore a grimace. At this stage, it was already obvious to him that Xu Miantu had deliberately thrown him and Zhou Wen into a trap.</p>
<p>From the initial provoking of Yang Lie to turning a blind eye to their peril, everything was a deliberate ruse by Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>The only person who was capable of doing this had to win the trust of Li Xuan and to know everything about him-Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan could do nothing. All he could do was stare intently at Xu Miantu as the duo were on the brink of falling into the pond.</p>
<p>There were exclamations on the bank. After all, they were still students. Even if they didn’t like Zhou Wen or Li Xuan, none of them wished them dead.</p>
<p>With Li Xuan and Zhou Wen about to fall into the pond, Xu Miantu’s face read, I had no choice. Don’t blame me.</p>
<p>Am I really such a failure as a friend? Li Xuan, who had been staring at him, could read his lips. He couldn’t help but feel a dreary sadness. The people he thought were his friends-Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu—had both betrayed him. It left him downhearted.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were about to fall into the water, a white and silver beam shimmered above the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Silver light swirled behind Zhou Wen as four transparent wings appeared behind him. They were rapidly flapping as they pulled him and Li Xuan up, allowing them to escape certain doom.</p>
<p>Impossible… How do you have a Companion Beast capable of flight? Xu Miantu looked at the flying Zhou Wen, feeling alarmed and afraid. His expression was distorted beyond description.</p>
<p>With Li Xuan in tow, Zhou Wen landed on the Dragon-Scaled Turtle’s back. He looked at Xu Miantu and said, “I kept giving you an opportunity, but unfortunately, you still did</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“Have you always suspected me? So you deliberately hid the fact that you own a Companion Beast capable of flight?” Xu Miantu stared at Zhou Wen in alarm and</p>
<p>anger.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t the case, how would I be able to test if you really treat me as a friend?” Zhou Wen said indifferently. “I’m cool-natured and do not know how to be nice to others, so when others are nice to me, I suspect if they have any ulterior motives. Although I also wish that you really had treated me as a friend, the facts have unfortunately proven that this world is as cruel as I imagined.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Zhou Wen glanced to the side of the lotus pond. He saw a beautiful girl floating in the sky with a pair of pure-white wings. This beautiful and holy beast was shockingly the legendary angel Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This angel Companion Beast had flown over and across the lotus pond almost at the same time that Zhou Wen had summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Zhou Wen looked at An Jing riding the white horse’s back. Zhou Wen had understood An Jing’s warning; he had just feigned ignorance to test Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>At the instant the angel Companion Beast appeared, even if Zhou Wen didn’t like An Jing as a person, he felt that he needed to thank her.</p>
<p>“I was afraid you wouldn’t die and wanted to make your death a clean one. From the looks of it, I don’t have an opportunity,” An Jing said with a deadpan expression as she reached out her hand to withdraw her angel Companion Beast. She then rode the white horse away.</p>
<p>“Xu Miantu, give me a reason to let you live,” Li Xuan said to him with a cold glare.</p>
<p>“Brother Xuan, I’m sorry. I was really forced. I was forced by your brother… Please, spare me…” Xu Miantu plopped to his knees as he hugged Li Xuan’s legs to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>“You’ve once risked your life for me. I can choose not to take your life, but you tried not only to harm me but Zhou Wen as well. Your life isn’t enough to atone two lives.” Li Xuan kicked Xu Miantu away and turned around. With his back facing Xu Miantu, he said, “Scram. If you can leave Luoyang alive, I’ll spare your life.”</p>
<p>Xu Miantu wore a livid expression. He was from the Li family and knew what it was capable of. As long as Li Xuan was unwilling to spare him, there was no way he could live Luoyang alive.</p>
<p>In his despair, a look of hatred flashed in Xu Miantu’s eyes. He pounced at Li Xuan with all his might, roaring with a ferocious look. “Then let’s die together!”</p>
<p>Just as Xu Miantu was about to pounce on Li Xuan, the latter took a sidestep to dodge him as though he had eyes on his back.</p>
<p>Unable to stop himself, Xu Miantu fell into the lotus pond.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Xu Miantu struggled and cried in the water. His flesh was corroded as bloody bubbles emerged. It looked extremely tragic and horrifying.</p>
<h3 id='chapter61'>Chapter 61 Qualifications</h3>
<p>Due to Xu Miantu’s death, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were investigated by the school, but they were quickly released.</p>
<p>“What kind of person is your brother?” In the dorm, Zhou Wen leaned against a chair and asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan casually sat on the floor, holding a can of beer and downing it slowly. Then, he said, “My family has three brothers. My eldest brother was a genius. He was good at everything, believed to be a super genius on par with An Tianzuo in Luoyang City. He was the most talented of our Li family. Unfortunately, he died young.”</p>
<p>Downing another mouthful of beer, Li Xuan continued, “My second brother, Li Xiubai, was promising at a young age. Although he wasn’t as illustrious as An Tianzuo. He’s a Li family genius known to all and he has a very good reputation outside. At home, he’s a figure who can discuss the Li family matters with the other uncles. He’s a lot stronger than a foppish scion like me. Most of my old man’s adopted sons look up to him as their leader.</p>
<p>“But you can see that my childhood friends, Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu, people who had the strongest relationships with me in the Li family betrayed me one after the other. They spent no effort to help my brother kill me. It was especially so for Xu Miantu. I’m certain that he wasn’t working for my brother before he returned to Luoyang. But in a few short days, he turned his back on me. You should be able to guess what kind of character and means my brother has.” Li Xuan crushed the beer can upon saying that.</p>
<p>“Why? Aren you vying for the Li family’s business? Just to be safe, he’s willing to do this to his younger brother? Doesn’t your father care?” Zhou Wen found it somewhat unbelievable.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not because of the Li family’s business. If it was only that, we wouldn’t have reached this point,” Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“Then what’s the reason?” Seeing Li Xuan silent, Zhou Wen said, “Forget it if you can’t</p>
<p>say.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan shook his head slightly and sighed after a long period of time. “The higher the levels of dimensional creatures, the greater the difference in strength. Just like Legendary creatures are almost no match for Epic creatures, with the gap between the Epic stage and the Mythical stage even larger, it can be said that even a hundred humans at the Epic stage might not be able to kill a Mythical creature. It might even lead to their complete wipeout.”</p>
<p>“I’ve learned that from the textbooks.” Zhou Wen felt that Li Xuan was saying the obvious.</p>
<p>Li Xuan continued, “Then have you thought about how humans were able to kill the first Mythical creature considering the huge difference in strength?”</p>
<p>“Legend has it that the few founders of the League combined forces to kill it. It’s also the Six League Heroes as taught in the textbooks.” Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan definitely had more to tell</p>
<p>“Then do you know how they killed the Mythical creature?” Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“The books say that they had a difficult battle that lasted three full days…” Before Zhou Wen finished his sentence, Li Xuan interrupted him.</p>
<p>“Don’t believe in the books’ nonsense. If they were really only at the Epic stage, even sixty people wouldn’t be able to kill a Mythical creature, much less six,” Li Xuan said in disdain.</p>
<p>“Then how is one killed?” Zhou Wen asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“It’s because they had Mythical Companion Beasts,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t what you say contradictory? Without killing the first Mythical creature, how will one have a Mythical Companion Beast? This doesn’t adhere to logic.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan laughed in reply, “Of course it doesn’t adhere to logic. It’s because their Companion Beasts weren’t obtained by killing Mythical creatures. Instead, someone gave them to them. Although they can’t be considered real Mythical creatures and can only be called larva of Mythical creatures, it’s already enviable.”</p>
<p>“This still doesn’t adhere to logic. If someone gave them Mythical Companion Beasts, then the person who gave them must have killed Mythical creatures before,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“No one can answer this question. At the very least, not me. I only know that there’s such a department in the top brass of the League that does such matters. Some humans can obtain the qualifications just like the Six League Heroes. And my Li family has such a qualification. Then, the person who might be able to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast might be me. Only with me dead will this opportunity have a chance of landing on my brother. It’s because I was appointed by my old man,” Li Xuan said in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>“So that’s the reason. In that case, isn’t your old man going to rein in and do something about your brother?” Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>If it were him, he definitely wouldn’t kill his younger brother over such matters. However, everyone was different. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that his thoughts represented everyone. In fact, he always felt that his character and thoughts were in the minority.</p>
<p>“Rein in? How? Beat him to death? Or get me to give up the Mythical Companion Beast qualifications? At this point in time, I can only compete with my brother,” Li Xuan said with a glint in his eyes. He didn’t seem afraid and was even excited.</p>
<p>“You have to be careful.” Although Zhou Wen had never met Li Xiubai, he had a deep impression of him after what had happened to Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu.</p>
<p>“I will soon advance to the Legendary stage, then I’ll have nothing to fear. Instead, it’s you that should be careful. You have foiled my brother’s plans twice. With my understanding of him, he will definitely not spare you,” Li Xuan said very solemnly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded slightly. He didn’t believe that Li Xuan was being an alarmist. It was something very possible.</p>
<p>Although the campus didn’t permit private fighting, even Xu Miantu dared to take action in a dimensional zone under Li Xiubai’s scheme. It was difficult to guarantee that a second or third Xu Miantu wouldn’t appear on campus.</p>
<p>“Thankfully you live alone in Four Seasons Garden. The situation there isn’t as complicated as the ordinary dorms. It makes it a lot safer. Speaking of which, I recall that the An family also has the qualifications to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast. Unfortunately, you aren’t born into the An family; otherwise, you might have a chance to vie for it from An Jing,” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“Why would it be with An Jing? Didn’t you said that An Tianzuo was the genius? Shouldn’t the An family’s Mythical Companion Beast qualification be his?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“That I’m not sure. While my old man was telling me about the Mythical Companion Beasts, he had mentioned in passing that the An family had likely chosen An Jing. In Luoyang City, only my Li family and the An family has the qualifications,” Li Xuan said with great certainty.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was in a bad mood, so he drank plenty. In his drunken stupor, he vomited and collapsed in Zhou Wen’s bed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to sit on the chair to game since he had no intention of sleeping.</p>
<p>Although the Li family’s matters had nothing to do with him, it was as Li Xuan said; Li Xiubai-in his displeasure-might even want him out of the way, so he needed to be wary.</p>
<p>But no matter what he did, nothing was as effective as being strong himself.</p>
<p>After today’s experience and the battle with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen was quite inspired. He wanted to see if he could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus alone. Although this was a crazy idea, Zhou Wen could already see its viability.</p>
<h3 id='chapter62'>Chapter 62 The Storm Approaches</h3>
<p>Shortly after Zhou Wen entered the game, he saw a notification before he arrived at the lotus pond: Silver-Winged Flying Ant is currently in a hungry state.</p>
<p>The notification quickly disappeared, but Zhou Wen took no notice of it. He continued forward, only to receive automatic notifications from the system every ten minutes.</p>
<p>This fellow feeds on Companion Beasts, but Companion Eggs aren’t easily produced. Zhou Wen felt a little depressed and could only ignore the notification.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were rich, he could purchase Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but he wasn’t rich. The living allowance Zhou Lingfeng gave him was only enough for his usual expenses, leaving nothing left for him to buy Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>It’s best I am self-sufficient. I should grind more. Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar as he stormed into the lotus pond.</p>
<p>At this moment, a video remained at the top of the school’s Intranet trending searches-a video of Zhou Wen and Li Xuan combining forces to strike at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>It was unknown which student on the bank had recorded the video. From a bystander’s angle, the entire process had been recorded in high definition.</p>
<p>However, the video had clearly been edited. The entire video only reached the point when Zhou Wen summoned his silver wings and flew up with Li Xuan in tow.</p>
<p>“What the f**k. Isn’t Li Xuan that prodigal of the Li family? How is he this strong? He summoned three Legendary Companion Beasts at the Mortal stage and even slew the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus that many Legendary seniors at school couldn’t?”</p>
<p>“Li Xuan is too cool!”</p>
<p>“The other freshman isn’t bad either. Although he’s slightly weaker, he also has two Companion Beasts. They’re just quite unfamiliar ones. I’ve never seen them in the past. Are they at the Mortal stage or Legendary stage?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan went completely viral. Due to him hogging the spotlight, Zhou Wen wasn’t noticed by many.</p>
<p>This video also appeared on the desktop computer of Qiao Siyuan. He sat in front of his computer watching it several times with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Noticed anything?” Qiao Siyuan asked Liz.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan is very strong. This fellow is rather interesting. He really acted the part well in the past. All three brothers of the Li family are real pieces of work. It’s only because the eldest brother died early that the An family’s standing in Luoyang has not been shaken.” Liz watched a few times, but with Qiao Siyuan silent, she was already growing impatient.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan shook his head gently. “I’m not talking about that. Did you notice Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“Naturally. Although Li Xuan is very strong, the one giving instructions was Zhou Wen,” Liz said.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan stared at the computer screen as his eyes glowed. “No, I’m not talking about that. Look carefully. Zhou Wen did three consecutive jumps at full strength. Such a jump would probably be difficult even for you to accomplish without special Primordial Energy Skills or Primordial Energy Arts to support you.”</p>
<p>Liz was taken aback as she watched again carefully. A look of surprise emerged as she said, “Indeed. Without a Primordial Energy Skill or Primordial Energy Art to support that, the human body can hardly complete three consecutive jumps under gravity. He clearly didn’t use any Primordial Energy Skills. That must mean that his Primordial Energy Art is extraordinary…”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it written in his dossier? He cultivates in Ascetic Meditation and has cultivated it for years,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“But Ascetic Meditation is a Primordial Energy Art that’s good for Strength and Constitution. It doesn’t equip one with the characteristic of such repeated bursts. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen has hidden his cards well. He likely doesn’t cultivate in Ascetic Meditation,” Liz said.</p>
<p>Yet, Qiao Siyuan said with great certainty, “No, I’m very certain that Zhou Wen cultivated in Ascetic Meditation. At the very least, he was definitely cultivating in it before we met him in Guide City.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Liz was confounded.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you size him up carefully when you encountered the youth that appeared out of the blue? Back then, his skin was slightly yellow and there was a dark gold luster at the bottom of his eyes. That’s the characteristic of long-term cultivation of Ascetic Meditation. Back then, he must have cultivated it for years, but now, I don’t see those traits.</p>
<p>“But it’s only been days since our meeting with him in Guide City. Even if he were to switch Primordial Energy Arts in such a short period of time, he wouldn’t be able to completely replace Ascetic Meditation which he cultivated for years, right? At the very least, there should be signs of retrogression of those traits. It shouldn’t vanish in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>“That’s where the problem lies. Zhou Wen encountered Jing Daoxian and shortly after that, the Ascetic Meditation he cultivated for years was replaced by another Primordial Energy Art. And shortly after that, the An family changed the nomination from An Jing to Zhou Wen. Is there some connection in this matter?” Qiao Siyuan rapped his fingers on the table and said slowly.</p>
<p>Liz trembled. “Sir, do you mean that the An family and that devil, Jing Daoxian, have some kind of relationship?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t say that. However, there’s indeed something abnormal about Zhou Wen. Perhaps something happened between him and Jing Daoxian. Only a handful of people in the League can change the Primordial Energy Art that they have been cultivating for several years in such a short timespan, and Jing Daoxian happens to be one of them,” Qiao Siyuan said.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, doesn’t it mean that Zhou Wen is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian? We should do our best to bring him back for questioning as soon as possible.” Liz’s eyes lit</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>“There’s indeed such a necessity, but we are in Luoyang, not at our headquarters in the capital,” Qiao Siyuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“We can request the higher-ups for an arrest warrant. The Sunset College wouldn’t dare stop us from arresting someone,” Liz said.</p>
<p>“Sunset College might not, but one person would,” Qiao Siyuan said indifferently</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo? No way, right? Would he dare openly defy the League’s laws?” Liz asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Yes, he will,” Qiao Siyuan said with great certainty.</p>
<p>After some thought, Qiao Siyuan added, “However, it will depend on An Jing’s and An Tianzuo’s attitudes. They are likely displeased that Zhou Wen took away the nomination that originally belonged to An Jing. Otherwise, would the great Overseer An deliberately criticize an ordinary high-schooler during his inspection of Guide City? An Jing wouldn’t have specially transferred to Guide High School to beat Zhou Wen up.”</p>
<p>“Sir, what are you getting at?” Liz probed.</p>
<p>“Immediately apply for an arrest warrant, then bring back Zhou Wen as quickly as possible. You have to be fast. When that happens, even if the An family receives the news and tries to rescue him, we should have already asked everything we would like to know. Besides, An Tianzuo might not necessarily want to save him,” Qiao Siyuan said lightly.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I’ll apply for an arrest warrant as soon as possible. Once he’s brought back, I’ll definitely interrogate him personally.” Liz’s eyes flashed a burning flame.</p>
<h3 id='chapter63'>Chapter 63 I’ll Give You Three Months</h3>
<p>The weather was pretty good today. Zhou Wen brought a chair over and rested in the courtyard, suntanning while gaming.</p>
<p>As school hadn’t officially started, there weren’t any training or missions assigned yet. Zhou Wen led a rather pleasant life.</p>
<p>He had been constantly trying to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus alone, but he had failed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, all his efforts had not been in vain. He managed to have an ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg drop, but it was quickly fed to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>The typical Companion Beast only needed to depend on its master, absorbing the Primordial Energy that emitted from its master’s body for survival. It could also slowly recover from its injuries without needing to eat anything. At best, it would absorb some Primordial Energy Crystals, allowing it to quickly recover Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant needed to swallow Companion Eggs or Companion Beasts or the game would constantly notify him that it was in a hungry state. In the beginning, Zhou Wen ignored it, but later, the game indicated that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant would vanish in twenty-four hours if it remained in a prolonged hungry state.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had no choice but to feed it the Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg to alleviate the pressing matter at hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gamed in the yard, half leaning back. His neighbor, An Jing, had finished morning cultivation and had walked out of the cultivation room to the balcony on the second floor. Hoping to look far into the distance to relieve stress before continuing her cultivation, her gaze subconsciously swept towards the courtyard beside hers. Immediately she saw Zhou Wen gaming in the courtyard while sunbathing. Immediately, her mood turned foul.</p>
<p>Even if it’s as Mom said, that his talent is better than mine, so what? A person’s talent cannot decide his achievements. What right does a person who has engrossed himself in games to avoid reality-even after suffering a tiny setback-have to fight me for the Mythical Companion Beast? Besides, his talent might not be better than mine. An Jing watched for a while before heading downstairs, muttering to herself, “Mom, watch and see. I’ll prove that I’m better than Zhou Wen. I totally have the ability to fight for the right to possess a Mythical Companion Beast by myself. There’s no need for Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen was having a great time grinding when he suddenly heard his name. He turned around and saw that someone was standing quietly in the other courtyard by the fence, staring at him.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen gave An Jing a look before lowering his head to continue staring at his game screen.</p>
<p>“That Sun Strafe Art is real. You can cultivate it.” An Jing paused for a moment before saying, “If you don’t believe me, give a call to Uncle Feng. He will help you verify its authenticity.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was unconcerned about the authenticity of the Sun Strafe Art as he could no longer cultivate it anyway.</p>
<p>“Why did you give it to me?” Zhou Wen asked as he gamed.</p>
<p>An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You must feel indignant about losing to me last time, right?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. You beat me fair and square,” Zhou Wen said in passing. He really didn’t want to have any connection with An Jing. It was best if they could be like strangers.</p>
<p>The words An Jing had originally prepared were swallowed. Feeling a little uncomfortable holding it, she bit her lip and said, “I’ll give you three months to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art and advance to the Legendary stage. With your foundation, three months should be enough. We will then fight another match. If you still haven’t advanced to the Legendary stage within three months, I won’t show any mercy.”</p>
<p>After pausing for a moment, she added, “Don’t say that I’m bullying you. I’ll get someone to deliver you Primordial Energy Crystals and other cultivation necessities. Whatever Primordial Energy Skills you need can be given to me as a list. I’ll try to get them for you. Remember, you only have three months.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that An Jing was being unreasonable. He frowned and said, “I admit defeat. You win. There’s no need to go through so much trouble.”</p>
<p>He neither wanted to take advantage of the An family nor did he want to waste time competing with An Jing again. It was meaningless to him and defeating her brought him no benefits.</p>
<p>“You have to fight. Remember, I’m only giving you three months. I definitely won’t show you any mercy when the time comes.” After saying that coldly, An Jing turned around and left. She was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to hold herself back from beating Zhou Wen with how detestable he looked.</p>
<p>“Why must you fight with me?” Zhou Wen felt puzzled. If An Jing hated him because of Ouyang Lan’s remarriage, she could have beaten him right there and then without going through all that trouble.</p>
<p>“I want to prove that I’m better than you.” After finishing her sentence, she walked into her dormitory without looking back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat baffled. When it came to who was better, Zhou Wen only had a little fame in Guide City. However, An Jing was publicly known as a genius in Luoyang. She had advanced to the Legendary stage at the age of thirteen and Zhou Wen still hadn’t advanced. The difference between the two was almost unbridgeable.</p>
<p>Do all people from noble families have such odd tempers? Li Xiubai can scheme to kill his younger brother for a qualification. An Jing is likewise ridiculous. Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>He had no intention of fighting An Jing, much less cultivate the Sun Strafe Art. As for advancing to the Legendary stage in three months, he was still working hard towards that. Of course, he wished to advance to the Legendary stage within three months, but the Lost Immortal Sutra was somewhat weird, making it difficult to make any prior estimates.</p>
<p>An Jing returned to her small building and couldn’t help but head for the balcony on the second floor. She secretly shot a glance at Zhou Wen and saw that he was still sunbathing and gaming. He didn’t seem to feel any sense of urgency after what she had said or any intention to work hard. She couldn’t help but bite her lip.</p>
<p>After An Jing finally left, Zhou Wen didn’t manage to game for long before someone came to his door. Furthermore, there was not one but four people.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up and saw four people, three of which he didn’t know. One of them was Gao Yang who had a grudge against him because of Li Weiyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Gao Yang and company were here for revenge, but to his surprise, Gao Yang greeted him with a smile when he saw Zhou Wen sitting in the yard. “Zhou Wen, still remember me? I’m your fourth-year senior, Gao Yang.”</p>
<p>“Why are you looking for me?” Zhou Wen continued gaming, having no intention of inviting them in.</p>
<p>Gao Yang didn’t get angry as he continued chuckling. “You really don’t become close unless you fight. What happened wasn’t a big deal. If I had done anything wrong, I’d apologize to you today. Let’s ignore who was right or wrong and just bury the hatchet, alright?”</p>
<p>Gao Yang naturally wouldn’t make up with Zhou Wen for no good reason. The typical student who watched the video of Li Xuan and Zhou Wen battling the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus would feel that Li Xuan was formidable; thus, overshadowing Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, those who were truly keen knew that Zhou Wen’s role in the battle far exceeded Li Xuan’s.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was indeed strong, but there were still other students at Sunset College that were as strong as him. After all, Li Xuan hadn’t advanced to the Legendary stage and there were many students at the Legendary stage. They could replace Li Xuan’s role in the battle.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen, no other student could replace him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter64'>Chapter 64 Invitation</h3>
<p>“Okay,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Since he hadn’t suffered any losses the last time, as they were borne by Gao Yang and Su Mei, there was naturally nothing that was irreconcilable.</p>
<p>Gao Yang was very happy when he heard that. He pushed the door open and entered the yard, speaking as he walked. “I came here today for one other matter. Let me do the introduction. These three are students at our school. They are also your seniors. This is Hui Haifeng. You just matriculated, so you might not have heard his name. However, you’ll definitely learn of his name once you familiarize yourself with the campus.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, hello there.” Hui Haifeng reached out his palm in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>“Hello. I’m gaming, so just get straight to the point.” Zhou Wen was controlling the blood-colored avatar to battle in the Ant Nest. There were Vigor Ants everywhere swarming around him. He couldn’t divert his attention to shake hands with Hui Haifeng, so it wasn’t because of any disrespect.</p>
<p>Gao Yang and the other two showed their displeasure, but Hui Haifeng thought nothing of it. He said with a smile, “I’ve watched the video of you and Li Xuan fighting the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. It was truly impressive, your judgment and commanding left me surprised. It’s like you could predict the future. The only thing that’s a pity was that one of your teammates was problematic, preventing you from slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.”</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen not having the intention to answer him, Hui Haifeng continued, “I came here hoping to invite you to our team to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.”</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Zhou Wen was already rather familiar with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. He believed that it wouldn’t take long for him to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in-game, so there was no need for him to take any risks.</p>
<p>Gao Yang tried persuading him. “Zhou Wen, consider it. Hui Haifeng is a lot stronger than Li Xuan. These two are Legendary experts that rank in the top twenty in school. Killing the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with them is almost guaranteed. There won’t be many risks and it can be said that there are only benefits to it.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m really not interested.” Zhou Wen shook his head again.</p>
<p>He was doing his best grinding the Ant Nest dungeon, hoping to drop Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. For this reason, he wasn’t even visiting the lotus pond and chose to head to the Ant Nest where there were more dimensional creatures. He didn’t have the time to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen felt that what Xu Miantu said previously was right. In a place like Sunset College, showcasing one’s strength allowed one to gain more opportunities.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t need the opportunities as they would affect his gaming and become a distraction.</p>
<p>Gao Yang was slightly displeased. He thought differently of Zhou Wen only because Hui Haifeng appreciated Zhou Wen. He himself didn’t think Zhou Wen was that strong.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng patted Gao Yang on the back, indicating him to swallow his words back. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, “Let’s do this. I’ll hire you to help us slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. If you have any requests, raise it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to reject him and send them off so that he could game in peace when a thought flashed in his mind. He looked up and asked Hui Haifeng, “Any condition?”</p>
<p>“That will depend on whether it’s worth it,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You can hire me. But I want a Legendary Companion Egg.” Zhou Wen gave his condition immediately.</p>
<p>He had grinded an entire day at Ant Nest, killing countless Vigor Ants and only with good luck could a Companion Egg drop. Otherwise, nothing would drop, making it difficult for him to rear a Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>If he used a Legendary Companion Egg to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, perhaps it could grow faster and no longer suffer from hunger that quickly.</p>
<p>Gao Yang wasn’t willing when he heard that. “Zhou Wen, aren’t you being exorbitant? We are killing a blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so the chances of a Companion Egg dropping isn’t high. By wanting a Legendary Companion Egg, aren’t you being difficult?”</p>
<p>“That’s my price. If you want it cheaper, you are free to hire others,” Zhou Wen continued gaming as he said without looking up.</p>
<p>Gao Yang wasn’t done, but Hui Haifeng cut him off. “A Legendary Companion Egg, no problem. What kind do you want?”</p>
<p>“Any kind will do.” Since Zhou Wen was only using it as food, he didn’t have any special requests.</p>
<p>“Alright. I can give it to you tonight. Shall we head to the lotus pond tomorrow?” Hui Haifeng said without hesitation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally looked up at Hui Haifeng and said, “Sure, I still have another request.”</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, don’t push it,” Gao Yang said unhappily.</p>
<p>“No worries. Go ahead.” However, Hui Haifeng was unperturbed as though he didn’t care about it.</p>
<p>“If I am to go, everyone has to follow my commands. Before taking action, I also need to understand all the Companion Beasts you will use in detail. If you are also participating in the battle, I’ll also need to know your combat standards and Primordial Energy Skills”</p>
<p>“No problem,” Hui Haifeng replied immediately.</p>
<p>“Also, I will not join the battle myself like the last time. I’m only in charge of giving commands,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>“It’s your commanding ability that caught my eye. I don’t need you to take risks,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Deal. When will you send my Legendary Companion Egg to me?” Zhou Wen lowered his head and continued gaming.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng thought for a moment before giving a time. “Eight in the evening.”</p>
<p>After discussing the specifics, Hui Haifeng and Gao Yang left. On the way, Gao Yang said unhappily, “Haifeng, I really can’t tell how Zhou Wen is as important as you describe him to be? I’ve watched the video of his battle with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus numerous times. We are already very clear about what needs to be done. With our strength, we should be able to kill it by ourselves. Why must we spend so much to hire him?”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng shook his head slightly. “Seeing and doing are two completely different matters. Besides, we only saw a portion. We still have no idea what other capabilities the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus has.”</p>
<p>“We might not know, but neither will Zhou Wen. What use is he?” Gao Yang still couldn’t get his mind around it.</p>
<p>“I have a nagging feeling that Zhou Wen is somewhat different. Just treat it as buying some insurance,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>At eight that evening, someone sent a Legendary Companion Egg over. At the same time, a contract was included. Zhou Wen read through it and signed it after checking that it was fine. He then accepted the Legendary Companion Egg</p>
<p>Closing the door and returning to his cultivation room, Zhou Wen took out the Legendary Companion Egg from the box. At the same time, he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, hoping to see how it would eat a Companion Egg in real life.</p>
<p>Once the Silver-Winged Flying Ant saw the Companion Egg, it flew over and opened its huge mouth, biting onto the Egg and sucking at it. Soon, all that was left of the Companion Egg was its outer skin.</p>
<p>The next second, Zhou Wen saw a silver swirl around the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s body with a red hue within.</p>
<h3 id='chapter65'>Chapter 65 Growth</h3>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s silver and red light intensified and enveloped its body like a massive flame.</p>
<p>When the flame gradually died down and revealed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s body, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>It was now twice its former size, about the same size as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant which Zhou Wen had killed. However, its exterior wasn’t exactly the same.</p>
<p>On its body were some additional red-ringed stripes that alternated with the silver patterns. They made the lower half of its body appear like a hornet.</p>
<p>More strangely, the tip of the ant’s bottom had grown a silver spike that resembled a hornet’s tail.</p>
<p>Is this growth or mutation? Zhou Wen was astonished seeing this. He remembered that the person who delivered the Companion Egg mentioned that it was a Fire Hornet’s Companion Egg. From how it looked, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had apparently obtained some of the characteristics of the Fire Hornet.</p>
<p>He quickly checked the in-game stats and found that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s stats had changed drastically.</p>
<p>Silver-Winged Flying Ant: Legendary (Adult)</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: King of Low Altitudes</p>
<p>Strength: 17</p>
<p>Speed: 20</p>
<p>Constitution: 16</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 19</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Silver Wing Flash, Magical Needle</p>
<p>Companion Form: Wings</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised and delighted seeing this. With such stats, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could be said to be a pinnacle existence among Legendary Companion Beasts, especially its Speed. Typically, the stats of a Legendary maxed out at 18. 20 points was described as an Overdrive.</p>
<p>Although the Primordial Energy was lower than Speed, it was also an Overdrive value.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen, even more, was that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had an additional Magical Needle Primordial Energy Skill. It had become a Companion Beast with two skills, making it an excellent Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Although compared to the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus which had many skills, two skills weren’t many, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was already considered rather rare when most Companion Beasts only had one Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more delighted when he saw the information regarding Magical Needle. It was a long-range Primordial Energy Skill. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant could release a Magical Needle and attack a target from afar.</p>
<p>With this Silver-Winged Flying Ant, I don’t have to worry about killing the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Without a second thought, Zhou Wen ended the summoning of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and chose to enter the game dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen headed straight for the Underground Buddha City. With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s present size, it was big enough for him to sit on it. Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to ride on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and quickly fly to the lotus pond.</p>
<p>A Speed of 20 was much faster than Zhou Wen could run himself. It was almost the difference between a horse carriage and a sports car. It didn’t take long for him to fly to the bank of the lotus pond.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar jumped off the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s back and watched the ensuing battle from the sidelines. Without any hesitation, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant flew towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in the middle of the pond.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds shot at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as it flapped its four wings, leaving behind afterimages in the sky, easily dodging the attack range of the blood-colored lotus seeds.</p>
<p>A Speed of 20 was just too fast. In a blink of an eye, it arrived in front of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, to which the latter’s petals contracted in a bid to devour the former.</p>
<p>Just as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was about to be devoured, silver light swirled from its back. Like a rocket, it blinked several meters away, dodging the petals. At the same time, it slashed at them with its blade-like claws.</p>
<p>The blood pattern on the petal shimmered, producing a halo that blocked the claws.</p>
<p>Although the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Strength was already one of the best amongst Legendaries, it was unable to slice through the petal without the augmentation of any Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>The petal wasn’t slashed through, but it opened by itself, revealing the venomous toad which opened its mouth and spat venom at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>While the Silver-Winged Flying Ant easily dodged this, a silver light flashed at its tail, shooting a silver beam through the toad’s forehead.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The toad exploded, splattering its venom everywhere. However, the speed of the venom couldn’t catch up with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Speed.</p>
<p>After the toad was killed, the lotus receptacle was completely exposed. The lotus seeds that resembled blood crystals exposed their tips as they suffused a sanguine luster.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant didn’t stop as its silver tail flashed, shooting another Magical Needle at the lotus receptacle.</p>
<p>Magical Needle’s attack range was less than twenty meters. Although its range was limited, it was potent. The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus closed its petals, blocking with the blood-patterned Buddha Glow, but ended up being penetrated by Magical Needle.</p>
<p>At the instant the Magical Needle impaled the lotus receptacle, a blood-colored explosion erupted like a volcano. Twenty to thirty blood-columns spewed out, turning into bloody rain that covered twenty meters of the area. Whatever touched the bloody rain was liquefied. Even the other Buddha Heart Lotuses and lotus leaves living in the pond were no exception.</p>
<p>The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s petals were corroded by the bloody rain as they became riddled with holes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was fast enough and dodged most of the splash; otherwise, it would have been reduced to a pool of blood.</p>
<p>After the bloody rain finished its attack, Zhou Wen ordered the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to fly forward. At this moment, the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was no longer capable of putting up any resistance. It didn’t take long for its lotus receptacle to be sliced open.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary creature, Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>A dimensional crystal from the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus dropped. It almost fell into the pond, but Zhou Wen was quick enough to command the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to grab it.</p>
<p>Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal! Zhou Wen studied the text on the dimensional crystal carefully and was immediately exhilarated. He was originally a little depressed that no Companion Egg dropped, but after reading the text, he instantaneously felt better.</p>
<p>Although a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus wasn’t as valuable as a Companion Egg, it was possible that this Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s Primordial Energy Skill was able to help him enter Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>The Primordial Energy Skill of ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus is Heart Meditation. But a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus has several Primordial Energy Skills. I wonder if Heart Meditation will be obtained by absorbing its Primordial Energy Skill? Zhou Wen wasn’t sure either.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant brought the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus back to the blood-colored avatar’s side. The moment the latter touched the crystal, the energy within surged into its body.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, Zhou Wen felt a burning strength surge out of the phone. It instantly filled his body, making his body feel like a furnace. His body perspired profusely as though he had been scooped out of the water and was now being baked.</p>
<p>After quite some time, the heat gradually subsided and he felt a refreshing coolness emerge in his body.</p>
<p>It was especially so for his heart. It felt an indescribable comfort. It had a miraculous feeling of tranquility and coolness. At the same time, plenty of magical information surged into Zhou Wen’s brain.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. Attained Blood Meditation (Rank 9).’</p>
<h3 id='chapter66'>Chapter 66 Charging into Small Buddha Temple</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look at the blood-colored avatar’s stats and saw that the Heart Meditation in the Primordial Energy Skill slot had vanished. Replacing it was Blood Meditation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted activating Blood Meditation and immediately a cool aura emerged from his heart. That aura went to every part of his body by coursing through his veins, making Zhou Wen feel an indescribable comfort.</p>
<p>As for his skin, it suffused an abnormal ruddiness that made him look a little odd.</p>
<p>It felt a little different from Heart Meditation. Furthermore, the Primordial Energy expenditure was much slower. One point of Primordial Energy lasted almost three minutes. With 10 Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen could use Blood Meditation for almost half an hour.</p>
<p>If Blood Meditation is like Heart Meditation, half an hour should be enough to counter the Small Buddha Temple’s mysterious force. It’s enough for me to make a few trips to the stone staircase in front of the temple. Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time and immediately got the blood-colored avatar to ride the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and fly for Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>As he expected, Blood Meditation and Heart Meditation had the same effect. After activating Heart Meditation, the blood-colored avatar ran all the way up the stone stairs until it arrived in front of Small Buddha Temple without any accidents.</p>
<p>Small Buddha Temple was dilapidated. The sign on the door had already faded and the walls surrounding the temple were crumbling in many places.</p>
<p>Pushing open the dust-covered door, Zhou Wen saw the interior laden with dust. However, he was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>He was prepared to battle a powerful dimensional creature, but he didn’t see any dimensional creature in the yard. There was only a stone monument in the middle of the yard.</p>
<p>Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be somewhat perplexed when he identified the biggest words on the stone monument.</p>
<p>Large Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was well-known to many. It was a theoretical foundation of the Great Vehicle Buddhism. After the dimensional storms, a Buddhist figured out a Primordial Energy Art from it. Along with the Agama, it was ranked as the two greatest Primordial Energy Art in Buddhism. They were Primordial Energy Arts capable of the Epic stage, in no way inferior to the Li family’s Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had never heard of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. This name sounded like a joke.</p>
<p>After getting the blood-colored avatar to approach it and carefully look at its contents, he immediately felt his mind groggy, with his head almost exploding.</p>
<p>This sutra is odd! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Just as he was about to cast his gaze away, he suddenly felt the Primordial Energy in his body slow down.</p>
<p>Ever since Zhou Wen cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra, it would constantly flow without him needing to deliberately cultivate</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Now, the sudden slowdown of the Lost Immortal Sutra’s automatic circulation speed was unprecedented. However, after it slowed down, Zhou Wen felt his splitting headache seem to alleviate.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen looked at the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra again, he no longer felt the discomfort.</p>
<p>He was surprised as he continued reading the sutra. He realized that the more of it he read, the slower the Lost Immortal Sutra’s circulation became.</p>
<p>There was just too much text on the monument, so before Zhou Wen could finish reading it, the screen went black—the blood-colored avatar had died.</p>
<p>Ah! Only then did Zhou Wen recall that he had Blood Meditation activated the entire time. By reading the sutra for an extended period of time, Blood Meditation had expended all his Primordial Energy and stopped circulating.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Small Buddha Temple is just like the stairs. It has an odd force blanketing it. Without Blood Meditation to protect me, means death. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have read the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood and entering the Underground Buddha City dungeon again, Zhou Wen first headed for the lotus pond, planning to kill the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. It was best if a Companion Egg dropped and even if none dropped, a Primordial Energy Crystal was appreciated.</p>
<p>However, to his dismay, after spending plenty of effort, all that dropped was a 14-valued Strength Crystal when he finally killed the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar picked up the Strength Crystal and absorbed it, its Strength stat didn’t grow. It remained at 10.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, even if I cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra, the bottleneck of my realm remains. I’m unable to exceed the limitations of 10 points at the Mortal stage. Zhou Wen felt somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>After killing all the Buddha Heart Lotuses and finally replenishing ten points of Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen headed for the Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t waste time at the stone monument. After entering the temple, he headed straight for the grand hall’s entrance.</p>
<p>The grand hall was already in a shambles. Its roof had mostly collapsed and its door was slanted, about to topple at any moment. There wasn’t any sign above the door, so the name of the hall was unknown.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar pushed the door, causing it to creak and fall into the hall. With a thud, it sent dust flying into the air.</p>
<p>Looking at the dust-laden hall, his eyes first noticed a Buddha statue.</p>
<p>Although the game had a cartoon version of a Buddha statue, it still shocked Zhou Wen. Buddha statues typically had genial looks and stately bearing. Only a few guardians had furious glares.</p>
<p>However, those kinds of deities would never be consecrated in the middle of the main hall. Yet, this Buddha statue wore a devil’s expression. Although it didn’t have a furious expression, it made Zhou Wen shudder. It seemed to be staring at him coldly.</p>
<p>Boom! Zhou Wen only managed to take one look because the blood-colored avatar exploded the moment it took a step into the hall. It reduced to a pool of blood and the game screen went black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. Small Buddha Temple sure is odd. Just one look can kill. Thankfully, I didn’t head there with my real body; otherwise, no amount of lives could keep me alive. I wonder how those predecessors explored dimensional zones. Perhaps plenty of lives were sacrificed to attain what we have today.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen knew of stories of the tragic sacrifices when soldiers explored dimensional zones while in school, it was nowhere as shocking as experiencing it himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then had another thought. After entering the hall, even Blood Meditation is useless. However, the temple has a stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Perhaps it might be of some use. However, there’s clearly a Primordial Energy Art and I’ve already cultivated Lost Immortal Sutra. I can’t change my Primordial Energy Art and this Small Buddha Temple is so odd. Who knows if that Primordial Energy Art has any problems.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to first memorize the sutra when entering the Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>As for taking pictures, that could be struck off. Ordinary phones couldn’t take pictures of the screen of the mysterious phone, so all Zhou Wen could do was memorize it himself.</p>
<p>The sutra was very long, but thankfully, it wasn’t like the Lost Immortal Sutra which made memorizing untenable. Zhou Wen memorized a few paragraphs each time and left Small Buddha Temple whenever the time was almost up. He would then head back in once he recovered his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>After he had memorized the entire sutra, he realized that the sky had lit up. He had stayed up the entire night again.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen remembered the last line of the sutra, Lost Immortal Sutra, which had nearly stopped circulating, suddenly circulated crazily.</p>
<h3 id='chapter67'>Chapter 67 Sudden Shackles</h3>
<p>However, the circulatory path wasn’t that of the Lost Immortal Sutra, but a brand new one. It seemed as though he had completely switched Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen immediately recalled that the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra he memorized followed such circulatory methods.</p>
<p>With the Primordial Energy’s circulation, Zhou Wen felt the cells in his body seem to come to life. His body burned and itched as though countless worms were crawling under his skin.</p>
<p>He resisted the urge to scratch himself, but in fact, he didn’t dare move. When the energy flowed into him according to the Lost Immortal Sutra, he could move freely, but the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was different. The turbulent flowing of Primordial Energy made Zhou Wen afraid of moving, afraid that it would branch out wrongly.</p>
<p>After sitting on the sofa for quite some time, Zhou Wen felt his body jolt as though some shackle had been cleaved apart. His body relaxed indescribably as the hot and itchy feeling vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that he had achieved initial mastery of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>Opening his eyes and planning to look at his phone, Zhou Wen got a fright when he looked at his hands.</p>
<p>They were covered in lumps of peeled skin. He ripped off the skin without feeling any pain. In fact, it felt awesome.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t just his hands. His entire body had shed a layer of skin. Large amounts of dead skin could be easily peeled off by him.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to head for the bathroom and soak himself in hot water. The dead skin on his body peeled off, revealing supple new skin that had a milky luster to it.</p>
<p>He looked at himself in the mirror after taking a bath. There weren’t any intrinsic differences other than he now looked more refreshed and cleaner.</p>
<p>Returning to the living room, he once again lost himself to gaming. After he saw the stats of the blood-colored avatar, he couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>After cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra, his four stats were at 10. It didn’t improve even if he absorbed dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>But now, his Constitution had raised to 11.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously looked at the other stats which hadn’t changed. Even the listing of Primordial Energy Art remained as Lost Immortal Sutra. It didn’t have the addition of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>What happened? Why didn’t the game indicate my mastering of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Could it be that the game is unable to identify this kind of Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen felt puzzled as he attempted to circulate it and found it circulating as he wished. Clearly, he had gained some initial mastery of it.</p>
<p>He attempted to circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra and his Primordial Energy immediately circulated according to its pathway just as it had before without any changes.</p>
<p>Odd, what’s happening? Zhou Wen made a few more attempts and realized that he could freely switch between the Lost Immortal Sutra and Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom heard of people cultivating two Primordial Energy Arts at the same time. Many Primordial Energy Skills could be learned, but Primordial Energy Arts involved too many things. Typically, the higher the grade of the arts, the more conflict they had, making it difficult to cultivate two at the same time. It was especially so with arts capable of the Epic stage. If one were to cultivate both, it was possible to suffer a deviation and end up dying</p>
<p>To be able to switch freely between two Primordial Energy Arts was something Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>He was just about to attempt using the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to enter the temple when he heard his phone ring.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, it’s about time. Let’s meet at the lotus pond,” Hui Haifeng’s voice sounded over the phone.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Zhou Wen looked at the time and realized that it was almost nine. Although he hadn’t taken a wink of sleep the entire night, he was in no way tired.</p>
<p>He rushed to Underground Buddha City after packing up.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you sure made us wait,” Gao Yang said in displeasure.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I was late, right?” Zhou Wen looked at the time. It was ten minutes to the agreed-upon time.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about that. Here’s the information on our Companion Beasts. Have a look.” Hui Haifeng handed Zhou Wen a tablet computer.</p>
<p>The information included the details of the four people’s four Companion Beast, including Hui Haifeng. There were even videos of the skills their Companion Beasts could release. It made it easy for Zhou Wen to understand what abilities they had.</p>
<p>After carefully taking in the information, Zhou Wen looked up and asked Hui Haifeng, “You plan to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with the four Legendary Companion Beasts without joining the battle, right?”</p>
<p>“We only have one life after all. It’s best if we don’t take risks.” Hui Haifeng looked at Zhou Wen and said, “If four Companion Beasts aren’t enough, I can still think of other solutions.”</p>
<p>“As long as your control isn’t too poor, these four Companion Beasts should be enough. However, I have to make it clear. All of you have to obey my instructions. If any problems arise due to the disobedience of my instructions, I will not be responsible for anything. I will not refund the Companion Egg either,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No problem. We’ll leave it all up to you.” Hui Haifeng was rather obliging.</p>
<p>“Alright then. Let me go through the detailed plan. However, a plan is ultimately a plan. When the actual battle happens, follow my orders.” Zhou Wen informed them of his plan.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and company didn’t raise any objections after hearing it. One of the girls named Nana looked at Zhou Wen with piqued interest and asked, “If we follow your instructions in battle, but end up failing to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus or have any losses, what will you do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll make compensation,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Nana was very pleased with his reply.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pointed at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and said, “If there are no other problems, let’s begin now,”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and company summoned their Legendary Companion Beasts—three of them were birds while Nana’s was a vine. According to the detailed information, this was a Water Wisteria at the Legendary stage. It could resist the lotus pond’s corrosive nature and could move in the water. It was a plant-based Companion Beast that was excellent at water combat.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s command, the four Companion Beasts charged into the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Many students were watching this battle. Although the battle involving Zhou Wen and Li Xuan was interesting, they had failed to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. This time, with Hui Haifeng participating, many students believed that there was a high possibility of slaying it.</p>
<p>Not far away, two of the university’s teachers were looking at the lotus pond.</p>
<p>“Miss Wang, do you think Hui Haifeng and the rest will succeed?” Liu Zhengyan looked at the four Companion Beasts rushing into the lotus pond and asked in passing.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen and Li Xuan nearly succeeded the last time. This time, Li Xuan has been swapped with the stronger Hui Haifeng. The chance of victory is naturally higher,” Wang Fei said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter68'>Chapter 68 Commanding</h3>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Liu Zhengyan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Why?” Wang Fei asked, looking perplexed.</p>
<p>Anyone who had seen the video of Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s fight with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus knew that they had the means to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and were just short of the final strike.</p>
<p>Now, with four stronger people, it made no sense that they wouldn’t succeed.</p>
<p>“Watch this now.” Liu Zhengyan unlocked his phone and played a video.</p>
<p>“This is the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus? It doesn’t seem to be the same one?” Wang Fei gave the video a look and immediately saw a few soldiers fighting the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus via their Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan said, “This is a blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus found by the military elsewhere in Underground Buddha City. They used five Legendary Companion Beasts but ended up with tragic losses. They were almost wiped out.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that.” Wang Fei was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan skipped to the end of the video and let Wang Fei watch carefully. The final scene had twenty to thirty jets of blood spew out from the lotus receptacle.</p>
<p>Once they were hit by the blood, the flesh melted off the five Legendary Companion Beasts, plummeting them into the lotus pond amidst cries. None of them survived with an intact body.</p>
<p>“I never expected the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus to have such an ability. Should we stop Hui Haifeng and the rest?” Wang Fei frowned after finishing the video.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan shook his head and said, “If we were to warn them now, who can warn them when they head to some unknown dimensional zone in an expedition? Cruel reality is the best teacher. Today, they will pay for the experience using only a few Companion Beasts. In the future, it might save their lives.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei nodded slightly. Liu Zhengyan was right-in school, the dimensional zones they encountered had all been explored by the military. The level of danger wasn’t too high, causing some students to think little of dimensional zones. It was also good to let them suffer a little.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, what’s your take on Zhou Wen?” Wang Fei’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen who was overseeing the battle.</p>
<p>“To be honest, although his performance with Li Xuan was very exciting, I still think more highly of Li Xuan when it comes to potential. After all, to go far, relying on talent and hard work isn’t enough. Besides, I’ve heard that Zhou Wen is engrossed in gaming. He might not amount to much.” Liu Zhengyan paused and looked at Wang Fei. “You are the teacher in charge of Zhou Wen’s class, right? I’m afraid it will be hard for you.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei nodded as she looked at the distant Zhou Wen with a deep, meaningful look. She muttered to herself, “I don’t think so. This Zhou Wen might be quite an interesting fellow.”</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s commands, the four Companion Beasts besieged the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Hui Haifeng and the other three followed his instructions and were good at controlling their Companion Beasts. Soon, they tore open the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s petals and defeated the venomous toad.</p>
<p>After the toad exploded, the four controlled their Companion Beasts to charge at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, hoping to slay it.</p>
<p>“Windchime Bird, Blood Raven, retreat ten meters. Water Wisteria, retreat fifteen meters. Crow Tengu, head left seven meters and shoot Crow Feathers,” Zhou Wen instructed.</p>
<p>Seeing that victory was at hand and that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was about to die, the boy controlling the Blood Raven said in excitement, “Let me finish the final strike. Blood Raven, cast Blood Feather Storm!”</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng and Nana had followed Zhou Wen’s instructions and retreated the Companion Beasts they controlled. As for the boy, he didn’t make his Blood Raven retreat and instead launched the final strike.</p>
<p>Everything had gone too smoothly, so smoothly that he felt he could complete everything without the need for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As the blood feathers hit the lotus receptacle, it immediately riddled them with wounds. It seemingly cracked open as the boy felt a sense of smugness when he heard a boom.</p>
<p>The lotus receptacle suddenly exploded as blood splattered out, instantly raining down.</p>
<p>The Companion Beasts of Hui Haifeng and the other two had already retreated according to Zhou Wen’s instructions. They reacted with great composure, retreating out of reach of the blood rain’s range in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>As for the Blood Raven, it was too close to the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus since it hadn’t retreated ahead of time. It had no time to escape and it was drenched by the blood rain.</p>
<p>Gu!</p>
<p>The Blood Raven cried out tragically as most of its feathers rotted. It fell straight into the lotus pond, leaving all the other students drawing a cold gasp. The boy’s expression also turned nasty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a thing as he continued commanding, “Windchime Bird, cast Primordial Energy Skill attack to attack the flower stalk. Crow Tengu, use Crow Feathers as cover. Water Wisteria, prepare to catch the lotus flower.”</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s command, the trio successfully slew the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and dragged the damaged lotus flower out.</p>
<p>“Junior, not bad,” Nana said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Blood Raven’s death wasn’t my responsibility. I’m not making compensation,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The boy who controlled Blood Raven blushed as he said in embarrassment, “You don’t have to. I’m sorry, I was just too anxious. Zhou Wen, you were impressive. How did you know that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus still had such an internecine attack?”</p>
<p>“Faced with any dimensional creature, one has to view it with a sense of fear and reverence. Otherwise, you might end up paying with your life. I was only trying my best to prevent any accidents.” Zhou Wen randomly gave an excuse.</p>
<p>“I have to thank you or we would have really suffered terribly,” Hui Haifeng said with narrowed eyes. He didn’t mind the losses, but Zhou Wen’s performance had garnered his interest.</p>
<p>“I was paid so it was part and parcel of my job. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be heading back.” After Zhou Wen said that, he turned and left. The only thing on his mind was to head to Small Buddha Temple’s main temple and figure out what was inside. He really didn’t have the mood to say anything else.</p>
<p>Gao Yang watched Zhou Wen leave with mixed expressions. He always felt that Hui Haifeng’s hiring of Zhou Wen was superfluous, but now, he realized that without Zhou Wen, it was very likely that all four Companion Beasts would have died. It was better to lose a single Companion Egg</p>
<p>Liu Zhengyan also wore an odd look. “Strange, could it be that he has a relationship with the military and has seen that video?”</p>
<p>Wang Fei smiled and said, “Don’t you know that Zhou Wen’s staying at the Four Seasons Garden was arranged by the An family?”</p>
<p>“I see. No wonder.” Only then was Liu Zhengyan enlightened.</p>
<p>However, Wang Fei narrowed her eyes as she watched Zhou Wen leave. She still had something she didn’t say: Although Zhou Wen’s ties with the An family aren’t to be dismissed, this is definitely not obtained from the An family. How did this fellow do it? What an interesting chap. From the looks of it, I should delve deeper and treat it as helping Little Lan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and eagerly launched the game on his phone, entering Underground Buddha City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter69'>Chapter 69 Strange Temple Hall</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was already very familiar with Underground Buddha City. He rode on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to the lotus pond at full speed before killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus.</p>
<p>For others to kill the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, they needed to wait for one to travel through the dimensional rift; however, Zhou Wen simply needed to revive his blood-colored avatar and refresh the dungeon, allowing the game to reproduce a new Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. He could practically kill it an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>Killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was extremely easy for Zhou Wen now. After following a standard set of steps, it was killed.</p>
<p>Ding! An item dropped out of the lotus accompanying the crisp, melodic chime.</p>
<p>A Companion Beast! Zhou Wen was overjoyed for he never expected it.</p>
<p>However, he was currently unable to incubate Legendary Companion Beasts. The thing he could do was use the blood-colored avatar’s death to create an incomplete one just like the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>There was little meaning to doing so. Zhou Wen already found it difficult enough to rear a single Silver-Winged Flying Ant, so another one would probably bankrupt him.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar picked up the Buddha Heart Lotus, the system gave the fusion notification.</p>
<p>‘Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus and Silver-Winged Flying Ant have a compatibility score of 3%. Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus and Mutated Skeleton Ant have a compatibility score of 5%. Proceed with fusion?’</p>
<p>Fusion my ass. Zhou Wen felt depressed. The compatibility score was so low that the chance of a successful fusion was no different from striking the lottery. There was no need for him to take the risk.</p>
<p>If only I could take the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus out of the game. Zhou Wen spent some time studying if it was possible, but there was no such function to be found.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen also realized that he couldn’t sell it if he brought it into reality. It would be difficult to explain how he had obtained a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Using the mysterious phone’s function, Zhou Wen directly checked the Companion Egg’s stats.</p>
<p>Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear Lotus</p>
<p>Strength: 15</p>
<p>Speed: 13</p>
<p>Constitution: 12</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Blood-Patterned Buddha Aspect</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt somewhat disappointed after seeing that. The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus wasn’t too terrible in stats compared to the typical Legendary Companion Beast; however, compared to how potent a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was, this Companion Beast’s stats were nothing laudable.</p>
<p>It was especially so for the talent skills. The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus should have four Primordial Energy Skills, but this one only had one. Clearly, these weren’t the stats an excellent Companion Beast should have.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been somewhat hesitant in the beginning, but he no longer had any doubts now. He chose not to proceed with the fusion and fed the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant wouldn’t need to be fed after becoming an adult, but he soon realized that he was wrong. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant not only needed food, but it needed more than before.</p>
<p>After feeding the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, there weren’t any obvious changes other than the slightly hungry notification disappearing.</p>
<p>I can always wait till I have an excellent-grade Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus drop before incubating it. Zhou Wen naturally wished to have a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Beast with maximum stats.</p>
<p>After all, he had plenty of time to grind the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus in the future, so getting one was only a matter of time and luck.</p>
<p>After slaying all the Buddha Heart Lotuses in the pond, he didn’t obtain any ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Eggs and headed straight for Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>After entering Small Buddha Temple, Zhou Wen switched his energy circulation from the Lost Immortal Sutra to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Then, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to head into the temple hall.</p>
<p>The Buddha statue still wore a ferocious expression as it stared at the blood-colored avatar, but this time, the latter didn’t immediately die.</p>
<p>I’ve succeeded. The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra is really related to this temple hall. Zhou Wen was delighted as he continued proceeding forward with the blood-colored avatar. Finally, he saw what was inside the temple hall.</p>
<p>The temple hall had many Buddhist murals; however, they were different from the murals Zhou Wen had seen in the past. The murals here looked like scenes from hell.</p>
<p>There were ox-headed demons being thrown into boiling oil as well as bird-headed and human-bodied monsters having their tongues pulled out. There were also imps who were sawn into two. The entire temple appeared creepy and terrifying as though it was a punishment chamber in hell.</p>
<p>And the Buddha statue was very different from the typical one. Other than its ferocious face, it also had two other faces.</p>
<p>It had three faces on one head, with the one facing Zhou Wen looking ferocious. As for the faces on the sides, the left one looked similar to the ordinary Buddha statue with a benevolent look and smile.</p>
<p>However, the right face was even stranger than the front-facing face. It was a crying face with bloody tears at the corner of its eyes. There was a sliver of melancholy amidst the ferociousness.</p>
<p>What Buddha is that? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled, he had never heard of any three-faced Buddha in the little he knew of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The temple didn’t have a sign, nor were there any signs indicating the name of the Buddha statue. The entire hall was empty except for the Buddha. There weren’t any dimensional creatures either.</p>
<p>Amidst Zhou Wen’s puzzlement, he saw the Buddha statue’s six eyes light up with a golden glow. Then, the statue which appeared to be carved from stone slowly suffused a golden halo, making it appear gilded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he tried to get the blood-colored avatar to retreat. There was definitely something sinister due to the anomaly. Although death in-game wasn’t true death, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste a drop of blood.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could retreat out of the hall, the six eyes shone out like a torchlight, illuminating his body. Then, he saw the Buddha statue speak.</p>
<p>However, the words said were soundless. Instead, they appeared onscreen in text form.</p>
<p>‘My pious child, a Buddhist representative that walks the land, you shall earn the grace of Buddha. You can choose one of the three Buddhist-type creatures as your guardian.’</p>
<p>As the text appeared, the two arms of the Buddha statue’s gilded body raised up slowly. In his palms, swirls of light condensed and gradually formed three Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>The three Companion Eggs were resplendent with golden light as though they were emitting a strange Buddhistic glow.</p>
<p>That nice? A Companion Egg is given directly? Is it the same for the Small Buddha Temple in reality? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he carefully sized up the three Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>They were glowing with golden light as though protected by the Buddhistic glow. The only difference was the size, making it obvious that they were not the same Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried to use the phone to check the three Companion Eggs’ stats, but failed. All he could do was try his luck.</p>
<h3 id='chapter70'>Chapter 70 Three Choose One</h3>
<p>With the naked eye, the three Companion Eggs were golden in color, but the three types of gold were different.</p>
<p>As this was in-game, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to tell how big the three Companion Eggs were. Using the blood-colored avatar as a comparison, the biggest Companion Egg was about half a person’s height. Not only did it have a golden Buddha glow swirling around it, but there was even a scarlet hue amidst the golden glow. Although its temperature couldn’t be felt, the huge egg seemed to be scorching hot inside.</p>
<p>The leftmost Companion Egg was the smallest. It was about the size of the blood-colored avatar’s fingertip. It was also golden, but the Companion Egg was crystalline like a golden opal.</p>
<p>The middle Companion Egg was about the size of a soccer ball. It looked like it was tempered with gold and its outer shell was filled with rugged patterns. They looked like Buddhist scriptures that Zhou Wen couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Which one should I choose? Zhou Wen sized up the three Companion Eggs, having been thrown into a dilemma.</p>
<p>Although he could sense the same sensory feelings as the blood-colored avatar, he wasn’t able to tell which was better from its vision.</p>
<p>‘My child, choose by following your heart. There’s no need to hesitate.’ The strange three-faced Buddha spoke again. And again, it appeared in text form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a while and realized that there was nothing to be hesitant about. He had never heard of the three Companion Eggs before and had nothing to base his judgment on. He might as well choose one that caught his fancy and leave the rest to fate.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate further. He got the blood-colored avatar to reach out to grab the smallest of the three Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>The small Companion Egg appeared like a golden crystal in the blood-colored avatar’s hand. Immediately, the Buddhistic glow emitted.</p>
<p>‘Obtained Mythical Companion Egg, Truth Listener. Automatically incubating…’</p>
<p>“F**k… You are going to kill me…” Zhou Wen immediately cried out as he threw the mysterious phone out of his hand.</p>
<p>A Mythical Companion Egg was very strong and impressive, but Zhou Wen knew himself. With his Primordial Energy, just incubating a Legendary Companion Egg was enough to suck him dry, much less a Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn’t fast with the throwing. A terrifying force surged out from the phone and instantly sucked dry Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>11 points of Primordial Energy was pathetic. Zhou Wen instantly felt drained and that wasn’t all. His blood seemed to be sucked by a water pump, gathering towards his ten fingers.</p>
<p>The tips of his fingers burst as ten spouts of blood spewed onto the phone, and instantly, the phone sucked it clean.</p>
<p>I’m doomed. Am I going to be the first college student in the new era to die gaming? This thought flashed across his mind, but the suction force from the phone vanished the next second.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s fingers finally regained their freedom. They no longer had blood gushing out. At the same time, a strange golden pattern appeared on his left ear.</p>
<p>The golden pattern resembled a symbol that tattooed itself on the back of his left concha. It gave him a warm, fuzzy feeling in his left ear.</p>
<p>I actually incubated a Mythical Companion Egg? Zhou Wen couldn’t believe the outcome for it was too unbelievable.</p>
<p>A Legendary Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg was enough to kill the blood-colored avatar, but the Mythical Companion Egg didn’t blast it apart. It only sucked dry all of Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy and a portion of his blood. This didn’t seem to match the status of a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen incubated Truth Listener, the two other Companion Eggs in the three-faced Buddha’s hands disappeared. The resplendent Buddha statue that emitted a Buddhistic glow also slowly converged its glow and was restored to its original stone form. It no longer spoke or did anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly checked Truth Listener’s stats to confirm whether it was really a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Truth Listener: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Golden Body, Evil Warding, Nine Extremes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Earring</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes nearly popped out. Truth Listener wasn’t at the Mythical stage but at the Mortal stage. However, Zhou Wen had never really heard of a Mortal Companion Beast with 11 for all its stats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it had four talent skills. This was already the maximum number of talent skills a Companion Beast could have.</p>
<p>The system’s notification said that it was at the Mythical stage, but why is the incubated result at the Mortal stage? Could it be related to the evolvable trait? But how do I evolve it? Don’t tell me it’s like the Silver-Winged Flying Ant-evolving by eating Companion Eggs? Zhou Wen didn’t dare to stay in the temple any longer, worried that something bad might happen.</p>
<p>After leaving, he circled Small Buddha Temple and realized that it lived up to its name-it was really small. Apart from the temple hall, there weren’t any other temples, but it was possible that the collapsed rubble had covered the other areas of the compound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find anything after circling Small Buddha Temple once. The three-faced Buddha didn’t react when he entered the temple again.</p>
<p>All he could do was leave and quit the game. Only then did he dare summon Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Small Buddha Temple was just too odd. Even in the game, Zhou Wen didn’t dare mess around in there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a stranger to the name Truth Listener’; in fact, he knew it well.</p>
<p>In Buddhist myths and legends, Truth Listener was the mount of Kșitigarbha Bodhisattva. Legend has it that it was manifested from a white dog and had the ability to know all that happened in the world. It was also extremely loyal.</p>
<p>In Journey to the West, the six-eared Macaque had impersonated Sun Wukong and no deity was able to distinguish between them. Although Truth Listener could tell them apart, it didn’t dare speak it out loud.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me this fellow is really the legendary Truth Listener? Zhou Wen felt somewhat expectant.</p>
<p>However, after Truth Listener was summoned, Zhou Wen was left somewhat depressed. It wasn’t a white dog but a golden-silk monkey the size of a palm.</p>
<p>Its golden fur resembled golden silk and its eyes resembled two golden gems. It looked extremely adorable, but it was just too small.</p>
<p>This fellow is Truth Listener? Zhou Wen found it somewhat unbelievable.</p>
<p>This mini-figure stood at opposite ends with those terrifying stats. They didn’t seem connected at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried Truth Listener’s companion form and immediately, it turned into a golden earring behind Zhou Wen’s left ear.</p>
<p>He felt his ear quiver suddenly as though whatever blockage in his ear had been pulled out. His hearing became clear, many times sharper than his normal hearing. What he couldn’t hear before could now be heard very clearly.</p>
<p>“Uh!” A woman’s moan suddenly sounded in Zhou Wen’s ear, making him feel somewhat odd. When he glanced at the direction it came, he realized it was from his neighbor.</p>
<p>And his neighbor was that proud and cold, somewhat crazy, An Jing.</p>
<p>That’s not right. The buildings here should have special soundproofing features. Even those with hearing Primordial Energy Skills can’t hear things through the walls, so how am I hearing what’s happening next door? Don’t tell me that Truth Listener boosts my hearing ability this much? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter71'>Chapter 71 Sick</h3>
<p>Painful moaning kept sounding from next door. Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he hesitated whether to take a look.</p>
<p>But when he considered how An Jing was an unreasonable person, he decided it was best not to have anything to do with her. Besides, they were on campus with the most advanced hospital attached to it. If An Jing really was in trouble, she was a phone call away from having a doctor rush over to rescue her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to take off the Truth Listener earring when he heard a thud as though something heavy had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>When the sound reached Zhou Wen’s left ear, a blurry scene of An Jing falling to the ground from a great height appeared in his mind. The scene vanished almost as quickly as it came when it was silent next door.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me that something really happened to An Jing? Although Zhou Wen wasn’t too concerned with An Jing, he didn’t have a blood feud with her. On the account of her mother, Ouyang Lan, he couldn’t just watch as she died.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to head next door to take a look.</p>
<p>Washing his face and walking out of the building, he jumped over the low wooden fence and stood in front of An Jing’s door and pressed the bell that came equipped with a</p>
<p>camera.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed that if An Jing could reply, it meant that she was okay. He could then return to gaming.</p>
<p>However, if no one replied, it definitely meant that something had gone wrong. He couldn’t just sit idle; after all, he had a basic sense of compassion. He would call emergency services even for a stranger.</p>
<p>After pressing the doorbell once, he didn’t hear any response as the building was silent. Zhou Wen used the ring on his left ear to listen carefully, but still failed to hear any sounds inside. There weren’t any footsteps either.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me something really happened? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. To make sure, he repeatedly pressed the doorbell, but silence was the only response.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, something really happened. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen began looking carefully at the building.</p>
<p>The door had a keypad door lock and it was made of special materials. It wasn’t easy to smash through the door. If he couldn’t enter, he planned on reporting it to the school.</p>
<p>Shifting his glance up, he realized that the special tempered glass sliding door on the second-floor balcony was closed but not locked. He leaped up to the balcony, opened the sliding door and entered the building.</p>
<p>The buildings in Four Seasons Garden were identical. Zhou Wen rushed straight for the bedroom with great familiarity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the problem happened in the bedroom. If something untoward had happened in the cultivation room, I’ll probably have to report it to the school authorities. I wonder if they will be in time to save her though. Zhou Wen opened the unlocked door and entered.</p>
<p>What welcomed him was An Jing in bed, her face shockingly pale. Her eyes were closed as she gritted her teeth tightly. She was profusely sweating and her body appeared stiff. She didn’t look like she was in a good condition.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?” Zhou Wen walked forward and crouched down beside An Jing. He then pinched the bottom of her nose.</p>
<p>However, An Jing wished she were dead. Due to her physique, she had been diagnosed with a strange illness. She had periodic relapses that would leave her body in excruciating pain. In serious cases, her entire body would go numb and she would remain motionless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this strange illness was like a woman’s period. It came rather punctually and An Jing could expect when it would happen. During those periods of time, she would stay in her room to silently endure the pain until it</p>
<p>was over.</p>
<p>Today, she had planned to stay in bed to silently endure the pain just like she usually did. But this episode was worse than normal, so she couldn’t help but let out a soft, painful moan. This was heard by Zhou Wen wearing Truth Listener as an earring.</p>
<p>Due to the pain, An Jing fell from the bed while rolling about. The fall made her body stiff and motionless, but she remained lucid.</p>
<p>She had also heard Zhou Wen pressing the doorbell. She believed that he would leave without any response, but to her surprise, he had barged in by jumping into her balcony.</p>
<p>An Jing felt deep regret for not locking the sliding door.</p>
<p>In fact, she wasn’t to be blamed. They were in Sunset College after all. Only students were admitted inside and there were surveillance cameras everywhere. Since no one knew of her physical problem, they wouldn’t dare barge into her room.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked towards the bedroom, An Jing kept enduring the pain while praying that he wouldn’t enter. This was because she was only wearing a nightgown.</p>
<p>A symptom of each episode was profuse sweating, so there was a need to change her clothes. To reduce the trouble, she changed into a nightgown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, An Jing’s current position was rather unbecoming due to her fall. Having received etiquette lessons from a young age, she couldn’t accept others seeing her in that pose, especially Zhou Wen who she treated as her enemy.</p>
<p>He clearly didn’t think too much about it. He treated her as a patient and asked while pinching her nose. “Can you hear me? Can</p>
<p>you?”</p>
<p>An Jing opened her eyes and glared at Zhou Wen, but that was all she could do. At this moment, her pain had already reached its climax. Her body was stiff and her entire body was trembling. Even her teeth were chattering, so she had no strength to speak.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll call the doctor for you.” Zhou Wen felt relieved when he saw her open her eyes. Since she wasn’t dead, there was likely a chance of treating her.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate and took out his ordinary phone and called the school’s emergency number to get the hospital to send a doctor over.</p>
<p>As a student of Four Seasons Garden, the perks they enjoyed were pretty good. They also had the best medical facilities.</p>
<p>An Jing fumed with anxiety when she saw him about to call the hospital. Her ailment wasn’t something an ordinary doctor could treat, so visiting the hospital was pointless. Otherwise, with the An family’s resources, she would have received the best treatment from the best doctors and hospitals in the League.</p>
<p>What made her feel most unacceptable was that she wore a nightgown that only covered half her thigh. Also, her hair was disheveled. She couldn’t accept letting other students see her in this state if she were carried out by the medical team.</p>
<p>Although she knew that he was doing it out of goodwill, An Jing couldn’t help but grit her teeth in anger.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen about to make the phone call, An Jing tried hard to regain control of her body. With immense willpower, she shouted through chattering teeth, “D… Don’t call… I’m fine…”</p>
<p>An Jing was drained of all her strength by the time she said those words. Her face was even paler and her voice was intensely trembling. She almost couldn’t hear what was being said.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was wearing the Truth Listener earring and could hear her clearly. However, he looked at her painful expression in a doubtful manner and said, “You don’t seem fine. If you’re sick, you need treatment. You shouldn’t hide your ailment and not take medical advice. Relax and leave the rest to the doctors…”</p>
<p>An Jing was in despair. Thankfully, her pain had already climaxed and she was now feeling a lot better. Enduring the stabbing pain, she said harshly, “I’m really fine. Leave.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter72'>Chapter 72 Blood Replenishment Tea</h3>
<p>“You don’t look fine.” Zhou Wen thought and said in enlightenment, “Are you afraid that I’ll take this opportunity to seek revenge? Don’t worry. Although I don’t think too highly of you, I wouldn’t harm you on account of Sister Lan and my dad. I’m just calling for a doctor.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen continued calling the emergency hotline.</p>
<p>An Jing burned with anxiety and embarrassment as she shouted once more, “There’s no need. Really, there’s no need. I… I… I was having menstrual cramps… I’ll be fine after some rest… Leave… Don’t disturb my rest…”</p>
<p>An Jing had given that reason because she couldn’t think of anything else. She just wanted him to leave.</p>
<p>“I see. I’ve heard that women can be in great pain a few days a month, but I never expected it to be this bad.” Zhou Wen had lived alone from a young age and he didn’t have a mother Thus, he had little contact with women. When he was a little older, he began cultivating and hadn’t ever had a girlfriend. He knew almost nothing about such matters.</p>
<p>Although he remained suspicious, Zhou Wen believed that it was unlikely that she would play games with her life.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. I’ll leave now,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment before he turned to leave An Jing’s room.</p>
<p>An Jing heaved a sigh of relief when she saw him leave. The pain she was experiencing also seemed to lessen significantly.</p>
<p>“Women sure have it tough. Fortunately, I’m a man. I don’t have to endure such pain every month,” Zhou Wen mumbled to himself as he returned to his residence.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, he realized that he had it tough as well. He had endless noise blaring into his ears like an irritating chant when he slept. He also had to lose large amounts of blood daily. It was especially so this time. To incubate Truth Listener, he had lost at least 500-600 cc of blood. He didn’t have it good either.</p>
<p>I bought some brown sugar and wolfberries last time, and I’ve no idea if it will work. I might as well cook some to give it a try. My anemia has been pretty terrible recently. Zhou Wen scratched his forehead and thought to himself.</p>
<p>Returning to his room, Zhou Wen forgot the matter of making the blood-replenishment drink as he continued grinding.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen entered the Ancient Imperial City dungeon. After killing the Skeleton General, he had a Skeleton General Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>However, the stats weren’t comparable to the first one in every aspect. Zhou Wen directly fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. As for Truth Listener, as there weren’t any hunger notifications, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it needed to be fed.</p>
<p>Switching to the Underground Buddha City, he no longer had any need to explore the Small Buddha Temple again since he had finished covering the area. He had slain the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus in the lotus pond and it hadn’t spawned again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen skipped the lotus pond and ventured deep into Underground Buddha City.</p>
<p>In the midst of his travels, he saw a few lotus ponds, but not every one of them had a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. After spending an entire day, only one ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>Although the stats were relatively ordinary, it was a heart-type Companion Beast. Zhou Wen incubated it, planning on using its companion form to temporarily allow his heart to continue functioning if it was ever damaged.</p>
<p>After so many sleepless nights, Zhou Wen finally couldn’t take it. He switched off his phone and slept through to the next morning. Only then did Zhou Wen get up to cook the supplements, making a pot of brown-sugar, wolfberry tea.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you up? Today is matriculation day. Come on out and walk around.” Just as Zhou Wen finished brewing his tea, Li Xuan called.</p>
<p>“What’s there to see?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Today’s the matriculation day for the freshmen. Many clubs in school are recruiting freshmen. We can also take a look,” Li Xuan said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“I have no interest in joining any clubs.” Zhou Wen poured a cup of blood-replenishing tea and drank it.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to join one. You can take a look at all those beautiful female juniors and seniors.” Li Xuan revealed his true motives.</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Zhou Wen still planned on exploring Underground Buddha City.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so cold. There are benefits. The school will assign missions and most of them need to be completed by a team. The seniors already have their own teams. If we want to make a new team, we will have to recruit from the freshmen. To walk around now is also to prepare for the future…”</p>
<p>Li Xuan gave plenty of reasons that irritated Zhou Wen so much that he agreed to walk around campus.</p>
<p>After drinking a huge bowl of tea, Zhou Wen filled up a thermos and walked out of his place.</p>
<p>It just so happened that An Jing walked out at the same time. She couldn’t help but grit her teeth when she saw him. However, she was slightly taken aback when she saw the glass thermos in his hand.</p>
<p>She recognized it. There were wolfberries and other supplements in it and it was obvious that it was brewed with brown sugar. Her servants had previously prepared it for her.</p>
<p>Do you think you can bribe me with a cup of brown-sugared water? Men almost never drank this and after what happened yesterday, An Jing imagined that he had brewed it for her, hoping to warm up his relationship with her.</p>
<p>Although she had this in mind, the look in her eyes softened. She found Zhou Wen rather thoughtful and sensitive.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked out of his yard, An Jing came out as well. He needed to walk past her to leave the compound.</p>
<p>She watched as Zhou Wen walked over, wondering if she should accept it if he were to give it to her.</p>
<p>Amidst her thoughts, he arrived in front of her and saw An Jing looking at him. He nodded at her gently as a greeting.</p>
<p>An Jing imagined that Zhou Wen was about to give her the tea when he nodded at her. She turned her head away slightly, waiting for him to hand it over.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Zhou Wen just walked past her with the thermos in hand. He had no intention of walking towards her. Furthermore, he even drank a mouthful while walking off.</p>
<p>“It seems to be a little too sweet,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself after taking one mouthful.</p>
<p>An Jing’s face burned as her eyes nearly spewed flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t paid any attention to her and walked straight out of Four Seasons Garden.</p>
<p>Why don’t you die from an overdose drinking something like that! An Jing clenched her teeth hatefully as she looked at his departing figure.</p>
<p>Today was matriculation day. However, Sunset College was unlike the typical school. There wasn’t any welcome ceremony or many decorations. Apart from the crowds, it didn’t seem any different from usual.</p>
<p>On the two sides of the road, there were two rows of tables neatly placed. There were banners and signs placed in front of themrecruitment notices of the school’s clubs.</p>
<p>Sunset College encouraged them to set up clubs, hoping that it could increase cooperation between students, especially when they entered dimensional zones to complete missions.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’m here.” Just as Zhou Wen was looking around, he heard Li Xuan’s voice from a particular club’s recruitment booth.</p>
<p>He looked over and found Li Weiyang and Li Xuan standing together, the former waving her hand at him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter73'>Chapter 73 Matriculation Day</h3>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you interested in joining the Weiyang Club?” Li Weiyang winked at him. “Members of our Weiyang Club are basically all women. Many of them are beautiful female seniors.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t reply as Li Xuan yelled, “Sis, that’s not fair. How can you snatch him from me? However, it’s useless even if you try. Zhou Wen and I are establishing a new club. He won’t join your Weiyang Club.”</p>
<p>Li Weiyang curled her lips and said, “That depends on whether Zhou Wen is willing to establish a new club with you. Sisters, let’s show our Weiyang Club’s strength to our junior.”</p>
<p>The row of female students behind-all contending in beauty and fascination-began putting up all kinds of sexy, mesmerizing, and adorable poses. They were like flowers in full bloom.</p>
<p>“A honey trap!? Sis, that’s against the rules!” Li Xuan protested as he salivated.</p>
<p>“It’s called the reasonable usage of available resources.” Li Weiyang ignored Li Xuan’s protests as she smiled at Zhou Wen. “How about it? Consider joining the Weiyang Club. I won’t treat you shabbily.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. “I’ve already told Li Xuan I’d set up a new club with him.”</p>
<p>Li Weiyang was somewhat helpless after he declined her invitation. “Alright then, but I hope that your new club can ally with our Weiyang Club. We can always complete missions together if an opportunity arises.”</p>
<p>“No problem. Absolutely no problem,” Li Xuan agreed immediately, his gaze wandering across the bodies of the female students of Weiyang Club.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? Little Virgin?” Li Weiyang mocked Li Xuan. After saying bye to Zhou Wen, she led the girls to recruit other freshmen.</p>
<p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, “Zhou Wen, you missed an excellent opportunity. The Weiyang Club usually only recruits female students. You almost became their only male member. You missed a chance of being an emperor.”</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen thought nothing of it. He looked around and said, “When can we establish the club? Can we begin recruiting members now? If we don’t do it now, the better freshmen might all be taken.”</p>
<p>The other clubs were recruiting freshmen, but Li Xuan didn’t seem prepared at all.</p>
<p>He said helplessly, “This is also beyond our control. Freshmen can only apply to set up a club one month after matriculation. Also, you will need to have at least five students before you can make the application. The typical student will choose to join existing clubs, so it will make it quite difficult for us to set up a new one. However, we wouldn’t be under the mercy of others or care about other older members.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. That was one of the reasons he hadn’t joined the Weiyang Club.</p>
<p>If possible, he’d rather not join any club. Gaming alone in peace was much better than joining any club.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the freshmen entering from the school’s main gates when he was suddenly taken aback. He saw two familiar figures.</p>
<p>One of them was a tall girl and the other was a boy of medium stature. They were none other than Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong.</p>
<p>The duo also saw Zhou Wen. They walked over with backpacks. Tian Xiangdong even greeted him in a rather triumphant manner. “Zhou Wen, you never expected to see us here,</p>
<p>right?”</p>
<p>“I never expected the two of you to be admitted into Sunset College.” Zhou Wen was really surprised. The League had plenty of universities and Sunset College wasn’t the best choice. Yet, the duo had chosen to study here.</p>
<p>Fang Ruoxi looked at the clubs around and asked Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, have you chosen a club?”</p>
<p>“Babe, Zhou Wen and I plan on setting up our own club. Join us. I’ll make you vice chairwoman.” Li Xuan posed handsomely and hit on Fang Ruoxi.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Fang Ruoxi replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Xuan never expected her to answer so quickly, leaving him stunned. Then, he said bashfully, “However, we are all freshmen. We will only be able to apply for the club in one month. Babe, if you are in a rush, you can always take a look at the established clubs.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan might speak bombastically, but he was a genuine virgin. Furthermore, he was a virgin who didn’t dare lose his virginity.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll wait till your new club is established,” Fang Ruoxi said firmly as she stole a glance at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you sure are fortunate,” Li Xuan patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said with a smile.</p>
<p>He naturally could tell that Fang Ruoxi was only joining because of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, I’m really sorry about what happened. Please believe me that nothing like that will ever happen again.” Fang Ruoxi was naturally referring to her sudden quitting of the team during the college entrance exams.</p>
<p>“No worries. It wasn’t your fault.” Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart.</p>
<p>He always believed that since Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong were unrelated to him, it was only normal for them to quit.</p>
<p>Tian Xiangdong hurriedly said with a smile, “That’s right. We really had no choice. Now that we are at Sunset College, we have a promising future. We don’t have to worry that much anymore. We guarantee you that nothing like that will happen again.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t speak further. Things were always unpredictable. No one knew the future, so any guarantee now was without meaning.</p>
<p>“Since we are all former schoolmates, I’ll take you to the matriculation booth,” Li Xuan introduced as he walked. “Sunset College is different from the other schools. There are very few protocols and ceremonies. There aren’t any welcoming ceremonies or matriculation ceremonies for freshmen. Just register at the matriculation booth and be assigned to your dorm. Classes start tomorrow. By the way, I forgot to tell you, the first class of the first day at Sunset College is a combat test. Freshmen will be sent into dimensional zones to hunt dimensional creatures. Make sure you are mentally prepared.”</p>
<p>“Where will be the test? Buddha City?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Of course not. Buddha City was only recently discovered. It isn’t fully under control, so they won’t send freshmen to take risks. Based on past experience, they will go to one of the four relatively safer dimensional zones on campus. Every freshman just needs to kill one dimensional creature to complete the mission. The more killed, the better the results,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“What’s the point in that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Count it as a way to benchmark. Although you can be admitted into Sunset College and everyone is a top student in their various high schools, everyone’s abilities are varied. Such a test allows the teachers to understand their true strength. Secondly, it’s also to create a ranking of the freshmen,” Li Xuan explained.</p>
<p>“What’s the freshmen ranking?” Tian Xiangdong asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“A results ranking. The higher the ranking, the more resources the school will provide. Consider it a reward system.” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “If this were in the past, Zhou Wen would have had the chance to enter the top three, but there are just too many strong freshmen this year. Just An Jing alone, who advanced to the Legendary stage two to three years ago, makes her a definite first in the rankings.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter74'>Chapter 74 Dimensional Forum</h3>
<p>After Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong had finished matriculation and were taken to their dorms, Zhou Wen returned to his. He wasn’t too interested in such activities.</p>
<p>Just as he reached Four Seasons Garden, he saw a few students walking in with their luggage in tow. Clearly, the special admissions students had arrived and were beginning to move in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them. He naturally didn’t care what they looked like. He walked to the row of buildings at the back of Four Seasons Garden with his head bowed.</p>
<p>Just as he reached the last row, he saw a girl standing in front of the other building, opening the door with her dorm key.</p>
<p>“Hello there. My name is Wang Lu. You live next door, right? We will be neighbors in the future,” the girl greeted Zhou Wen in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>“I’m Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen replied before entering his dorm.</p>
<p>This guy is odd. As expected of special admissions students. Do all of them have such a character? Wang Lu was curious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and used his phone to enter Ant Nest.</p>
<p>Previously, he had encountered a bottleneck at Ant Nest. After entering, his strength hadn’t allowed him to progress deeper. Now with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant evolving to an adult state, he planned on giving it another try.</p>
<p>Ant City was identical to before. It looked mysterious and bizarre. The ants were coming in and out of their nests and many of the black-winged flying ants were flying around.</p>
<p>He controlled the blood-colored avatar and stayed far away from the City, sending Silver-Winged Flying Ant to fly over alone.</p>
<p>The adult Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s stats made it a pinnacle existence among Legendary Companion Beasts. With a flap of its four wings, it flew directly towards Ant City.</p>
<p>The black-winged flying ants immediately discovered it and rushed at it while flapping their black wings. The black swarm looked rather frightening.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant moved like lightning as it used its stinger to shoot Magical Needle, tearing through the head of the black-winged flying ant that charged headfirst. It then plummeted.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant didn’t stop as it shot into the ant swarm like a silver bolt of lightning</p>
<p>‘Killed Black-Winged Soldier Ant. Discovered dimensional crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a dimensional crystal drop due to the black-winged flying ant’s death, but he was unable to pick it up due to the distance.</p>
<p>If the blood-colored avatar were to rush into the Ant City’s vicinity, it would suffer an attack. With his present strength, it would be difficult for him to survive the black-winged flying ant swarm.</p>
<p>He kept watching as chimes kept ringing. Many dimensional crystals dropped, but Zhou Wen didn’t dare pick them up. He felt quite depressed as a result.</p>
<p>mo</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant could hardly move amidst the black-winged flying ant swarm. Although he slew a lot, there were just too many of them. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was constantly in peril with the chances of it being overwhelmed by the ant swarm at any time.</p>
<p>Damn it. There are too many ants and they are Legendary creatures. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant can’t rush in at all. Zhou Wen thought of getting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to rush out, but it was already too late. Surrounded, it could only fight the black-winged flying ants that inundated it, the injuries it suffered increasing.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Another black-winged flying ant was killed, dropping a black-winged flying ant dimensional crystal-a black-winged flying ant’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>I’ll risk it! Zhou Wen looked at the copious numbers of dimensional crystals strewn across the ground. He could hold back, but upon seeing the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, he couldn’t hold back any longer.</p>
<p>He sent the blood-colored avatar to rush to the periphery of Ant City without any hesitation, summoning the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Truth Listener to distract the swarm.</p>
<p>The black-winged flying ants quickly noticed him. Before he could arrive near the dimensional crystal, massive numbers of them rushed over.</p>
<p>The Mutated Skeleton Ant tried to lead a number away, but it was only a Mortal Companion Beast. It died almost instantly under the Legendary creature horde.</p>
<p>Using this brief moment, he leaped up and rushed towards the spot where the dimensional crystal dropped. He had his eyes fixed on the black-winged flying ant crystal.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant also died at this moment from the barrage of attacks. Its bleeding carcass fell and large numbers of black-winged flying ants turned around and rushed for the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Let me pick it up! Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and used his greatest Speed and Strength to grab that black-winged flying ant crystal.</p>
<p>However, when its fingers were two feet away from the crystal, a large swarm of black-winged flying ants had rushed over, drowning it.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is in-game. If I had done that in real life, death would have been a certainty. Zhou Wen looked at the black screen and wore a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Dying without gaining anything in return was something Zhou Wen was already used to. Recently, he seldom died, unlike the period when he had first obtained the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Dripping a drop of blood to revive himself, Zhou Wen entered the game once more. However, he knew that his strength was still lacking if he wanted to charge into Ant City. Therefore, he headed for Underground Buddha City.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wished to visit Small Buddha Temple and see if he could make the selection again with the dungeon refreshed, hoping to get another Mythical Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, he was disappointed when he entered. Even though Small Buddha Temple had been respawned, he wasn’t able to trigger the scene with the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only obtain one Mythical Companion Egg in-game. I wonder if visiting it in real life will allow me to trigger the three-face Buddha’s gift of a Companion Egg. Although Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted, he didn’t wish to take the risk and finally eliminated the thought.</p>
<p>To obtain the three-faced Buddha’s Companion Egg, I apparently need to first master the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra or death is certain. Those soldiers do not know this secret, so I’m afraid there will be many sacrifices. Zhou Wen had the intention of telling this secret to the scouts who explored Underground Buddha City; thus, reducing their losses. However, firstly, he didn’t have the chance to interact with these soldiers and secondly, he had no way of explaining how he knew that.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he muttered, “Since I can’t tell them directly, I can post the strategy guide of Underground Buddha City on the League’s Dimensional Forum. This way, I can receive the official’s reward and also prevent those soldiers from making sacrifices in vain.”</p>
<p>The League had always been encouraging its citizens to write out their thoughts and experiences regarding dimensional zones. For this, it had specially set up a server and an official Dimensional Forum.</p>
<p>Posting dimensional zone strategies on the forum could be set as paid articles. It was even possible for the officials to buy the rights and use it as teaching material in textbooks.</p>
<p>To ensure that the poster didn’t have any hesitation in writing these, the Dimensional Forum used a completely independent server and high-security measures. Unless it was voted by Congress, no one could check the data of the Dimensional Forum.</p>
<p>For this, the League had clearly set up a guarantee by law. It was to prevent experts who didn’t wish to expose themselves to freely write their strategies on the forum.</p>
<p>The League had many powerhouses who had the habit of browsing the Dimensional Forum. The typical citizen also treated it as a resource database.</p>
<h3 id='chapter75'>Chapter 75 Fire God Platform</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t rush to post on the Dimensional Forum; instead, he first took a look at the other threads on it.</p>
<p>The threads mainly had three different kinds of monetization methods.</p>
<p>The first kind was a thread that provided a free strategy. Such threads didn’t require payment when reading. According to the number of clicks, the officials would pay a certain number of Dimensional Points in a particular ratio.</p>
<p>Of course, if the reader count was very low, one wouldn’t be able to earn many Dimensional Points. 10,000 clicks were probably only enough to earn 1 Dimensional Point.</p>
<p>Dimensional Points was the point system of the Dimensional Forum. It couldn’t be spent like money or be withdrawn. However, it could be used to exchange items at the Dimensional Forum’s official shop. Dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs were options for exchange and different items required a different number of points.</p>
<p>Exchanging for an item only required a mailing address. Receipt of the goods was done with a password without any need for identification.</p>
<p>The second kind of thread was monetized threads. Such threads could be read by paying. The price was determined by the poster and was also purchased with Dimensional Points.</p>
<p>Of course, threads posted by unknown people on the Dimensional Forum basically didn’t have many people paying to read. One had to have a certain level of fame before people considered the purchase.</p>
<p>The third kind of thread was official threads. An official guide and strategy was provided and could typically be read at very cheap prices. Furthermore, the authenticity of the content could be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen registered a Dimensional Forum account which only required a bank account number, password, and alias without any other agreements.</p>
<p>The entry of a bank account number and password was relatively simple. As for aliases, there were many which were duplicated. It was difficult to find a unique name.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to think of one. He randomly tapped on the keyboard and pressed space, immediately having a few words appear in the alias field.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what he had written, but on careful inspection, he realized that autocomplete had filled it in as “Poison.” Zhou Wen subconsciously pressed confirm and realized that it could be used. The registration succeeded immediately.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care about his alias and directly used this account to log in and post his first thread.</p>
<p>When posting, Zhou Wen chose monetization. Firstly, he was really poor and wished to earn something to buy Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Secondly, there were too many threads on the Dimensional Forum. Ordinary threads very easily sank to the bottom and in comparison, monetized threads were rarer. They stayed longer on the monetized boards.</p>
<p>After seeing the forum shop’s prices for Legendary Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen set the price for his first thread to be 20,000 Dimensional Points. This was the price of two Legendary Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Soon, a monetized thread named “Small Buddha Temple Stone Steps Strategy” appeared in the monetized board.</p>
<p>Ordinary monetized threads ranged from a few points to a dozen points, and the more expensive ones were about a hundred points. For a thread to cost more than a thousand Dimensional Points, meant they were usually professional strategies usually written by some bigwigs on the forum.</p>
<p>Yet, the Small Buddha Temple mentioned in the thread was almost unheard of. Even the alias which was used to post the thread was rather unfamiliar.</p>
<p>“This must be a nutcase. 20,000 points? Only an idiot will read it.”</p>
<p>“This must be a scammer that’s hoping someone gives him Dimensional Points.”</p>
<p>“The rules on the forum need to be more comprehensive. Such scams need to be held legally responsible.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei was also browsing the Dimensional Forum when she suddenly saw the thread. She couldn’t help but be astonished.</p>
<p>This was because Small Buddha Temple was in Sunset College’s Underground Buddha City. This secret wasn’t known even by ordinary teachers of Sunset College, but Wang Fei, who had an official position, knew very well what kind of place it was.</p>
<p>Since the person who wrote the thread knew of Small Buddha Temple and wrote the keywords “stone steps,” it meant that they knew something.</p>
<p>Could it be just some nonsense? Wang Fei felt hesitant seeing the price of 20,000 points. However, if the thread really held the method of entering Small Buddha Temple, then 20,000 points was nothing.</p>
<p>With so many lives sacrificed on the stone steps, each one of them was worth far more than 20,000 Dimensional Points.</p>
<p>Gritting her teeth, Wang Fei paid and opened the thread. When she saw the content inside, she revealed a look of disbelief. The Heart Meditation Primordial Energy Skill at the Mortal stage can crack the oddness of the stone steps? Is this possible?</p>
<p>The soldiers responsible for exploring the stone steps were at least at the Legendary stage. Even if they had obtained the Buddha Heart Lotus dimensional crystal, none of them would be interested in a low-grade Primordial Energy Skill. To her surprise, such a puny Heart Meditation was able to resist the stone step’s mysterious powers.</p>
<p>The thread had little content. That was all it said. Finally, it warned that one was not to enter the temple or death was a certainty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had posted the thread out of goodwill, but he also had some selfishness.</p>
<p>He only had one life, so he was worried about risking his life heading for the Small Buddha Temple in reality. If reality was different in-game, he could at least get the military to scout it out. If they could safely enter Small Buddha Temple, he wouldn’t hesitate any further.</p>
<p>After all, the military didn’t know the secret of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Even if they did, cultivating it wasn’t something that could be done in a short span of time. Zhou Wen could beat them in entering the temple hall in the real world and visit the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>Of course, he had to confirm that reality’s Small Buddha Temple was identical to the game. Only with him being able to safely enter would he personally visit it.</p>
<p>After Wang Fei saw the thread, she immediately made a phone call and informed the military department she came under.</p>
<p>Before long, Wang Fei received feedback from the military. They had already sent a soldier who had cultivated Heart Meditation to attempt ascending the stone steps. He ended up entering the compound of Small Buddha Temple without dying like all the soldiers from before.</p>
<p>The thread is real! Who’s that Poison? How does he know about Small Buddha Temple? Wang Fei was shocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen discovered that he had two clicks on his thread which also meant that two people had purchased his thread. Immediately, he had 40,000 Dimensional Points deposited into his account.</p>
<p>That’s some easy money. Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>However, he soon discovered that no one else purchased his thread beyond the two clicks.</p>
<p>If I had known, I should have set the price even higher. Zhou Wen stopped paying attention to the thread and entered the Ancient Imperial City dungeon.</p>
<p>After killing the Skeleton General, Zhou Wen continued exploring. With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant leading the way, the large horde of Skeleton Soldiers could do nothing against him. He stormed all the way in.</p>
<p>After several kilometers, a platform obstructed his path. From afar, he saw the words—”E Bo Platform.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a stranger to this name. E Bo was one of the sons of the Five Emperors in Chinese mythology, which was also the founding ancestor of the Shang clan. He had the title of Fire God, so E Bo Platform was also known as Fire God Platform, a star observatory that E Bo used.</p>
<p>However, in the history books, Zhou Wen remembered, Fire God Platform wasn’t inside the ancient city, but southwest of it.</p>
<p>Amidst his thoughts, he saw the fire on Fire God Platform burgeon. A scarlet flame soared into the sky, turning into a firebird that charged at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<h3 id='chapter76'>Chapter 76 Wang’s Man</h3>
<p>The firebird was extremely fast. Silver-Winged Flying Ant dodged the firebird’s charge with Silver Wing Flash, but the blood-colored avatar didn’t have the same speed. It was already too late to summon the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to turn it into wings.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t dodge, Zhou Wen struck out with Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>However, when the palm made contact with the firebird, it felt like he had struck air. There was no corporeal entity to direct his force and by then, the firebird had already charged into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The next second, the blood-colored avatar exploded like fireworks, turning the screen black.</p>
<p>Unwilling to accept this, Zhou Wen dripped his blood and revived the blood-colored avatar. He charged straight for Fire God Platform and before long arrived there. This time, he was prepared. He first turned Silver-Winged Flying Ant into its companion form. Four translucent silver wings appeared behind the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Indeed, the firebird flew out from the top of the Fire God Platform once more. Zhou Wen used the flight obtained from silver wings to face off with the firebird and, although he couldn’t shake it off, the firebird was unable to catch up to him.</p>
<p>Ignoring the firebird, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to fly towards the Fire God Platform. He wanted to see what was on top of it.</p>
<p>The Platform was squarish in shape like a gigantic chimney. It was a thousand feet tall and although he wanted to fly to its peak, his silver wings only allowed him to fly a dozen meters or so. He wasn’t able to reach higher altitudes.</p>
<p>The Life Providence as King of Low Altitudes allows the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to be extremely agile at low altitudes, but it can’t fly too high. This is a damning weakness. Zhou Wen landed on the stone steps of the Fire God Platform and seeing the firebird about to chase up to him, he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and shot Magical Needle at it.</p>
<p>The firebird didn’t dodge and allowed it to rush straight at it.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Magical Needle was useful as it exploded the firebird; however, the system didn’t indicate that he had killed a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. Just as he was about to rush up to the Fire God Platform, he saw another flame soar into the sky from the top of the platform. This time, two firebirds swooped down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued rushing up the staircase and before long, the two firebirds came to him. The blood-colored avatar gained the silver wings and faced off with the two firebirds again. After taking painstaking efforts, he finally slew the two firebirds. But this time, four firebirds flew out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare kill them. All he could do was try his best to escape the firebirds’ pursuit and head to the top of the Fire God Platform as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen was wrong. Even if he didn’t kill the firebirds, the top of the Fire God Platform sent out eight firebirds when he reached a certain height.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already doing the best he could, but he wasn’t the firebird’s match. Soon, the blood-colored avatar had a firebird charge into his body and exploded to its death.</p>
<p>However, from where it stood, he could already see some of the Fire God Platform’s peak. There was a stone monument erected on it, but Zhou Wen was only able to see the tip and vaguely made out the word: ‘Imperial.’</p>
<p>The game screen went black, but he didn’t immediately revive again. Instead, he recalled his past experiences.</p>
<p>After killing the firebird, there wasn’t any indication of me killing dimensional creatures. This means that they aren’t dimensional creatures. If they aren’t, it means they are a type of Primordial Energy Skill. But why didn’t the dimensional creature at the top of Fire God Platform release large numbers of firebirds at the very beginning but instead slowly double them up?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then thought of something. In real life, the ancient city is clearly Guide Ancient City, but the game dungeon’s name is Ancient Imperial City. That Fire God Platform has a stone monument with the word “Imperial” on it. Could it be related?</p>
<p>Unable to figure things out immediately, Zhou Wen decided to take a rest and calm his mind.</p>
<p>Pouring himself a cup of blood-replenishing tea, he sipped at it as he checked if there was any new income from the thread he had posted on the Dimensional Forum.</p>
<p>He was left disappointed as the clicks remained at two. However, he had received a private message on the forum.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the message was posted by a user named “Wang’s Man.” He clicked it and gave it a look.</p>
<p>“Dear Sir, might I discuss Small Buddha Temple with you?”</p>
<p>“Discuss?” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>Wang Fei always had the forum open on her phone. Although she hadn’t received a reply after waiting for quite some time, she had continued waiting patiently.</p>
<p>The discovery of Small Buddha Temple was too astonishing. After using Poison’s method, the military had finally rushed into the compound of Small Buddha Temple and discovered the stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>This discovery astounded Wang Fei and the military top brass. Such a stone monument had been discovered in other mysterious dimensional zones in the past. People had mastered the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument and earned a mysterious Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, Wang Fei and the military top brass knew very well that although the Primordial Energy Art was potent, it wasn’t something that anyone could cultivate. One needed the corresponding special physiques to cultivate the corresponding Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Although they saw the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, no one dared to cultivate it. A volunteer attempted to memorize the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra on the stone monument, but a few words were enough for him to clasp his head and cry out in pain. He then died with blood gushing out of his seven orifices.</p>
<p>A general had personally visited the stone monument before ordering all soldiers to leave Small Buddha Temple. Furthermore, all news regarding Small Buddha Temple was made top secret.</p>
<p>Wang Fei contacted Poison on the general’s orders.</p>
<p>“Have you mastered Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra?” Wang Fei hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“What has that got to do with you?”</p>
<p>“I’m willing to pay large sums of money to buy information from you.” Sensing the other party’s tone to be somewhat impatient, Wang Fei got straight to the point and indicated her motives.</p>
<p>“What information? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what special physiques are needed to cultivate in the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra?” Wang Fei hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had no idea what physiques were needed. However, on second thought, he immediately came to a realization.</p>
<p>I was wondering why the three-faced Buddha called me his child. I thought it had to do with my cultivating of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, but from the looks of it, it’s not that simple. But I don’t seem to possess any special physique. If Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra requires one to cultivate, how did I succeed? With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up. Could it be the Lost Immortal Sutra?</p>
<p>He recalled that his brain felt extreme discomfort when he began reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. After the Lost Immortal Sutra took effect, he was able to finish reading the former in its entirety and mastered it.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s most likely Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>Wang Fei waited for quite a while, but there was no reply. She couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy, but it wasn’t appropriate for her to send another message to rush the person. All she could do was continue waiting, with every second feeling like an eternity.</p>
<h3 id='chapter77'>Chapter 77 Matriculation Test</h3>
<p>Wang Fei didn’t receive a response after waiting all day. Her message was like a rock sinking into the ocean. Finally, she couldn’t help but send another message, but once again, she didn’t receive a reply.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her, Zhou Wen had already closed the forum and was gaming away.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what physiques were needed to cultivate the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, so he naturally wasn’t able to answer her. However, he didn’t wish to let the other person know that he was clueless. He decided to not answer for there was a chance he could learn more from the other party in the future.</p>
<p>But this only served to torture Wang Fei. This was because the Dimensional Forum didn’t have any indication of online status, nor was there any way of checking. Therefore, she didn’t know if Zhou Wen was online or not. All she could do was continue waiting.</p>
<p>Wang Fei immediately picked up her phone when it suddenly sounded and she saw the number flash up.</p>
<p>“Little Fei, did you figure out Poison’s identity?” A man’s voice sounded over the phone.</p>
<p>“Sorry, General Shen. There was no response from him. I’m also temporarily unable to figure out his identity,” Wang Fei said after a pause. “General Shen, can we figure out his geographical location through the forum?”</p>
<p>“The Dimensional Forum is under the Zhang family. You know what they are like. Unless Congress passes it through a vote, there’s no way we can get the information from them. It’s impossible. The Zhangs won’t even entertain me,” General Shen thought for a moment before continuing, “Since Poison knows about Buddha City and Small Buddha Temple, as well as the secret of the stone steps, it means he must have been there. This place is a recently discovered dimensional zone, so not many people have been there. Apart from our military personnel, there are only the students and teachers of Sunset College. Investigate it from this angle. You have to find Poison no matter what.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Wang Fei hung up and thought about how she could begin.</p>
<p>Quite a number of students and teachers had entered Buddha City, so it wasn’t an easy task to find out who they all were.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan reported for class.</p>
<p>Sunset College used an education system that followed half-restricted military practices. It was different from the typical university. Here, there was no distinction between electives and compulsory classes. They only needed to attend the lessons of one teacher. They could attend the classes of other teachers based on their own interests.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen happened to be assigned to Wang Fei’s class, and she was in a rather unhappy mood today. After entering the class, she saw all the freshmen looking languid. She pursed her lips before curling the ends of her mouth slightly.</p>
<p>“Students, from today, I’ll be your counselor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Wang Fei.” Wang Fei wrote her name on the board.</p>
<p>When the students realized that she was in her late twenties, exuding a mature lady’s sexiness by wearing a gray professional blazer matched with stockings, something that the female students were unable to compare with, some of the bolder students cheered.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was clearly one of the bolder ones. He called out, “Miss Wang, are you taken? If you aren’t, you can consider me.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Li Xuan’s words, many students laughed out. Many students also made catcalls.</p>
<p>Wang Fei seemed used to such situations and thought nothing of it. She shot Li Xuan a look and said, “Of course. But you have to first be able to graduate while under me. Alright, this is Sunset College. The word ‘Sunset’ is a warning to us that time is precious. Our school’s purpose is to cherish time. Now, I’ll be assigning you your first matriculation homework. It will also be your first test. Kill a Demonized General within ten days. Each team is only allowed a maximum of four people. The kill has to be done within ninety seconds. If you fail to complete the test, you will be expelled from school. You can then seek out other opportunities for yourself. The school will also arrange for you to apply to other ordinary schools.”</p>
<p>The noisy classroom instantly fell silent.</p>
<p>Students who were admitted into Sunset College weren’t to be trifled with. Before arriving on campus, many of them had gained an understanding of Sunset College via various channels.</p>
<p>To have a test on the first day of classes was a tradition of Sunset College. It wasn’t much of a surprise.</p>
<p>However, to slay a Demonized General within ninety seconds in a group of four, it was quite demanding</p>
<p>Sunset College had many dimensional zones, so the typical matriculation test was to kill a certain number of Mortal dimensional creatures, but a Demonized General was a Legendary dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Although the students here were all elites, most of them were at the Mortal stage. Killing a Legendary dimensional creature through the combined forces of four students at the Mortal stage wasn’t simple. Furthermore, Demonized Generals didn’t appear alone. They would have plenty of Mortal stage Demonized Soldiers around them, increasing the difficulty.</p>
<p>Most students probably were incapable of killing one in ninety seconds as a group of four.</p>
<p>“Miss Wang, we just matriculated and have learned nothing. Isn’t it too demanding for us to kill a Demonized General?” a student raised his doubts.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I give you ten days to learn? As long as you are willing to put in the effort, ten days is sufficient. If you don’t have the will, a hundred days would be useless. This is Sunset College. It doesn’t have that much time for you to waste. Kill a Demonized General in ten days or study at another university. Your fates are in your hands. Alright, this will be the end of the administration matters before class starts. You can officially begin attending lessons. As for the classes you would like to attend, it’s up to you to decide. The timetable has the various counselors’ lesson timings. You can choose the subjects you would like to learn more about.” Wang Fei handed out passes before she left, leaving the room filled with dumbfounded students.</p>
<p>“College life seems to be a little more interesting than I expected. Killing a Demonized General in ninety seconds in a group of four probably isn’t easily accomplished, much less ordinary students,” Li Xuan whispered to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The other students either lamented or grumbled. Their test was the hardest among all the matriculation tests in previous years.</p>
<p>“What kind of dimensional creature is the Demonized General?” Zhou Wen held the pass he had received and studied it. On it were the words: Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “Tiger Cage Pass is a dimensional zone east of campus. In ancient times, it was called Sihui Pass. After it became a dimensional zone, large numbers of Demonized General and Demonized Soldiers appeared. Among dimensional creatures of the same level, Demonized Generals and Demonized Soldiers are middle to upper tier. Some Demonized Generals even reach the level of pinnacle Legendary. They are very difficult to deal with. Such a matriculation test is really difficult for newly matriculated students.”</p>
<p>“Let’s visit Tiger Cage Pass then,” Zhou Wen said with piqued interest.</p>
<p>His other dungeons had reached a bottleneck. He was unable to reach the top of Fire God Platform and he couldn’t break into Ant City There wasn’t much to be discovered in Underground Buddha City, so it would be a good development to have a new dungeon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter78'>Chapter 78 Demonized General</h3>
<p>“Ms. Wang, you shouldn’t have used the test meant for the special admissions students of the previous two years on ordinary students, right?” Liu Zhengyan told Wang Fei inside the school office.</p>
<p>“These imps are filled with arrogance; if they aren’t taught a lesson, it might not be easy teaching them in the future. Mr. Liu, rest assured. I know what I’m doing,” Wang Fei said with great confidence.</p>
<p>Wang Fei naturally wouldn’t expel her students. She had prepared a strategy for killing the Demonized General. As long as these students worked hard to look up information on it, they would discover the strategy she had specially written.</p>
<p>By studying the strategy completely, it wasn’t difficult to slay the Demonized General within ten days.</p>
<p>The average student did research in school, but Zhou Wen was clearly an exception. Without doing any research, he and Li Xuan headed straight for the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Tiger Cage Pass was similarly underground. After receiving a temporary pass from the school, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were able to enter it.</p>
<p>The pass had to be returned in ten days, so it wouldn’t be easy for them to enter Tiger Cage Pass again after that time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the school wasn’t willing to open Tiger Cage Pass to everyone, but it had too few resources available for all. Real life wasn’t a game where dimensional creatures would keep respawning after being killed. One had to wait for new dimensional creatures to come out of the dimensional rift, and this process was much slower than in-game respawning.</p>
<p>Therefore, dimensional zones like Tiger Cage Pass that were specially prepared for students were typically opened up to them for fixed periods of time to ensure that there would be sufficient dimensional creatures in it.</p>
<p>Outside Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen discovered the familiar palm symbol, but it was a symbol with a tiger-headed gate.</p>
<p>Before entering, he used his mysterious phone to snap a picture of the palm symbol and indeed, he successfully downloaded the Tiger Cage Pass game dungeon.</p>
<p>Since he was here, he entered with Li Xuan to take a look. Several students from the same class had come as well. They too were here to take a look at Tiger Cage Pass’s situation.</p>
<p>In the underground ancient battlefield, Demonized Soldiers were wandering in groups. They wore ragged clothes and had blood-red eyes. Their dark skin suffused a metallic luster.</p>
<p>There were also different types of Demonized Soldiers. Most of them carried lances while others held knives and shields. A few of them had bows and arrows.</p>
<p>Most of the students were geniuses of their various high schools, so dealing with the typical Demonized Soldier wasn’t difficult. However, there were no signs of Demonized Generals anywhere in the vicinity.</p>
<p>“Shall we head in and find a Demonized General so that we can complete the test today?” Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Another day perhaps. It’s best we head back and study the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to underestimate any dimensional zone. It was equivalent to dancing on the edge of a blade.</p>
<p>Although he now had the capability of killing Legendaries, Legendary creatures were varied in their abilities. No one could guarantee that nothing would go wrong.</p>
<p>“You’re just too careful. Without strength, we can just be over and done with by storming in,” Li Xuan said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him and headed out. After returning to his dorm, he first launched the school’s official page and looked up the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Wang Fei had deliberately stuck to the strategy, so Zhou Wen naturally found it at a glance. When he loaded it, there was a detailed introduction to the strategy and how it could be used. As long as one cooperated well with one another, killing a Legendary Demonized General wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>However, it had pointed out something—the Demonized Generals mentioned in the strategy were typical Demonized Generals. If one were to encounter a Demonized General with engraving on their helmets, one was to immediately stay away from them.</p>
<p>After studying the information available, Zhou Wen launched the game dungeon and entered Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>The game’s graphics were nearly identical to Tiger Cage Pass, other than the fact that it was cartoonish. It didn’t look as bloody and terrifying</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s strength, killing ordinary Demonized Soldiers was easy. Even small groups of them didn’t pose any threat. He stormed his way and headed in the direction of Tiger Cage Pass’s gate.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant slew the ordinary Demonized Soldiers as if it was dicing vegetables. This went on for kilometers until he suddenly saw a Demonized General rushing over on a Demon Horse.</p>
<p>The Demon Horse was entirely red in color. It looked like a cloud of flames and its speed was astonishing. It arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant almost in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The Demonized General on the horse was abnormally stocky. It wore black armor and a helmet, and the weapon in its hand looked extremely odd. It looked like a spear, but the two sides of the spear tip had two crescent blades. It was more than three meters long and looked a little like the trident of the mythical Poseidon.</p>
<p>The raven-black spear suffused a red glow and although it was drawn in a cartoon style, it still gave one the feeling of ferocity and dominance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s gaze swept across its helmet and saw a circular groove. Engraved in it was the word “Paper.”</p>
<p>Boom! The Demonized General raised its spear and thrust it at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Burning flames spewed out of the spear tip, making the strange spear appear like a flaming wyrm that swept towards the ant at blistering speed. Clearly, it was a Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s control, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant used Silver Wing Flash to dodge the Demonized General’s thrust. At the same time, it moved its stinger and shot out Magical Needle, aiming right at the Demonized General’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The Demonized General let out a roar as its body produced fiery ripples that resembled lotus flower petals. It had surprisingly withstood Magical Needle as it threw the strange burning spear right at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly made the Silver-Winged Flying Ant fly higher, hoping to use the distance of height to prevent the attack from</p>
<p>hitting.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant flew to a height of more than ten meters, a height that Zhou Wen imagined the strange spear wouldn’t be able to reach.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, the Demon Horse, the Demonized General was riding, leaped up and jumped more than ten meters into the sky, instantly closing the distance between it and the ant. The strange spear in the Demonized General’s hand again swept at it like a fiery wyrm.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant lived up to its name as King of Low Altitudes. As it flapped its four wings, it dodged the attack like a silver bolt of lightning. However, a shocking scene happened the next second.</p>
<p>The Demonized General aimed one hand at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair and sucked at it. As though space was collapsing towards its palm, the Ant which was at least two meters away was pulled towards the Demonized General. No matter how hard it flapped its four wings, it was unable to escape the suction.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The strange spear cleaved down, immediately lopping off the motionless Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s head. Zhou Wen turned around and retreated, but the blood-colored avatar did not have enough strength to fend off a pinnacle Legendary creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had ultimately retreated too late. Without even pursuing him, the Demonized General sat on the Demon Horse’s back and threw the strange spear over.</p>
<p>The flaming wyrm tore through the sky and without being able to dodge in time, the blood-colored avatar was pinned to the sandy ground in the battlefield. The screen went black.</p>
<h3 id='chapter79'>Chapter 79 Crazy Grinding</h3>
<p>How terrifying! Zhou Wen didn’t feel depressed. Instead, his eyes lit up as he felt pumped with excitement.</p>
<p>The stats of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant were already considered top-notch among Legendaries. Yet, it had been butchered by the Demonized General. Such a powerful existence made Zhou Wen eager to obtain it.</p>
<p>Be it the Demonized General Companion Beast or the Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill, they were both of extreme value. It was especially so for the skill that could pull the Silver-Winged Flying Ant over. It was practically godlike.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he dripped his blood to revive the blood-colored avatar. He then chose to head for Tiger Cage Pass immediately.</p>
<p>The typical Demonized Soldiers held little meaning to him. He stormed all the way in, leaving a wake of destruction behind him. Soon, he encountered the Demonized General who came riding on a horse.</p>
<p>However, this Demonized General was somewhat different from the one he had previously encountered. Although it wore the same black armor and helmet, there wasn’t any engraving on its helmet. Furthermore, it was riding a black horse and it was slightly shorter. The weapon it wielded was an ordinary spear.</p>
<p>Upon exchanging blows, Zhou Wen realized that this was the ordinary Demonized General as described in the school’s strategy. It was completely different from the word-engraved Demonized General he had seen.</p>
<p>Although an ordinary Demonized General was rather strong, it wasn’t the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s match. After about ten minutes of battle, it was slain and had dropped a Primordial Energy Crystal.</p>
<p>A 15-valued Primordial Energy Crystal didn’t help Zhou Wen break through his limits. Apart from his Constitution at 11, his other stats peaked at 10. He was unable to exceed the limit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued controlling the blood-colored avatar as he stormed towards Tiger Cage Pass. The nearer he was to it, the more Demonized Soldiers there were. He did encounter two Demonized Generals, but they dropped nothing of note.</p>
<p>When the city gates of Tiger Cage Pass were in sight, Zhou Wen wanted to continue charging forward when he heard the twang of a bowstring. An arrow shot out from Tiger Cage Pass like a bolt of lightning, instantly killing the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>What the hell? Zhou Wen was able to hear the bowstring’s twang thanks to the Truth Listener earring, but he hadn’t managed to see who had shot the arrow, nor was he able to dodge it in time.</p>
<p>Such an outcome clearly didn’t satisfy him. He dripped his blood and entered the game again, but this time, he didn’t enter Tiger Cage Pass but first entered Ant Nest, Ancient Imperial City, and Underground Buddha City. After killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, Skeleton General, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once, he headed for Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>He failed to encounter a word-engraved Demonized General again and only encountered two ordinary ones. After killing them, he was killed on the spot by the arrow as he tried to approach Tiger Cage Pass. He still failed to identify who had killed the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Without immediately entering the game, Zhou Wen headed online to check the school’s online database and studied in detail the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>There was plenty of information, but little regarding the word-engraved Demonized General. It was only mentioned that they were occasionally encountered outside Tiger Cage Pass and were very rare, with one not even appearing for a month or two.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were many bigwigs who had their sights on word-engraved Demonized Generals. It was said that their Primordial Energy Skills were very valuable, but Zhou Wen didn’t manage to find any information regarding that.</p>
<p>As for what was inside Tiger Cage Pass, an Epic stage expert had once rushed in but ended up escaping with grievous injuries. To date, humanity hadn’t yet cleared the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The area twenty-five hundred meters outside Tiger Cage Pass was considered a forbidden area. Typical students and teachers were forbidden from entry and they had only themselves to blame if an accident were to occur there.</p>
<p>Without finding the word-engraved Demonized Generals’ detailed information, Zhou Wen tried again. He dripped his blood again to revive himself in the bid of encountering one outside Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>However, before heading to Tiger Cage Pass each time, he would kill the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, Skeleton General, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. A Legendary Companion Egg did drop and ordinary Companion Eggs dropped as well. They were all given as food to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Truth Listener also needed food, but it was picky. It only ate Companion Eggs and had no interest in incubated Companion Beasts. This made it different from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>For the next few days, Zhou Wen continued grinding crazily. After he slew a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once more, a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal dropped-a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>This was even rarer than a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg. He had already had three of them drop, but the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal only had one drop.</p>
<p>I already have Blood Meditation. I hope it isn’t the same one this time. Zhou Wen carefully looked at the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal’s</p>
<p>stats.</p>
<p>Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: Lotus Flower Buddha Body (Rank 9)</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he didn’t hesitate to let the blood-colored avatar fuse with it.</p>
<p>Lotus Flower Buddha Body was the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s protective Primordial Energy Skill and furthermore, it was Rank 9. Zhou Wen couldn’t ask for more.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Buddha-type Primordial Energy Skill was relatively mild. Although it was at the Legendary stage, it didn’t excessively burden Zhou Wen’s body. It allowed him to successfully obtain the Rank 9 Lotus Flower Buddha Body.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen attempted to circulate it, faint blood patterns immediately suffused his skin. They covered his entire body with flower petals as though a Buddha’s aspect was hidden within.</p>
<p>Lotus Flower Buddha Body expended one Primordial Energy point every second, therefore, only allowing him to use it for ten seconds. This was under the condition that he didn’t use any other Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>This Primordial Energy Skill is good in every way, but its expenditure is just too high, Zhou Wen thought with an insatiable desire.</p>
<p>He entered the game to try his newly mastered skill and realized that he had basically achieved invulnerability against the attacks of Demonized Soldiers at the same Mortal stage. His defensive strength was indeed pretty good.</p>
<p>It could also defend the attacks of ordinary Demonized Generals if they didn’t use Primordial Energy Skills. If they were to use one, the Lotus Flower Buddha Body wasn’t able to defend against it, but it still prevented him from being killed instantly.</p>
<p>Of course, this was under the condition that the ordinary Demonized Generals could hit the blood-colored avatar. In fact, with the silver wings formed by the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, ordinary Demonized Generals were incapable of touching the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>As for the arrow that shot out from Tiger Cage Pass, it was still able to penetrate his body. Lotus Flower Buddha Body’s defensive powers were like paper mache that didn’t show any obvious effects. Even Silver Wing Flash didn’t help him in dodging it.</p>
<p>The one shooting the arrow from Tiger Cage Pass is likely an Epic dimensional creature. Zhou Wen no longer dared to approach Tiger Cage Pass and only sought Demonized Generals in the periphery.</p>
<p>He grinded Tiger Cage Pass countless times, and one time, he encountered a red horse dash towards him shortly after he arrived near Tiger Cage Pass. The Demonized General riding on it was stocky and tall. Its strange spear, resembling Poseidon’s trident, was eye-catching. There was a word engraved on its helmet, making it the word-engraved Demonized General which Zhou Wen had been trying hard to find.</p>
<p>However, upon careful inspection, he was stunned. This was because the word engraved was different from the one he had previously seen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter80'>Chapter 80 Battling the Demonized General Again</h3>
<p>The last time Zhou Wen saw the Demonized General, it had the word Paper engraved on the helmet. This time, it wasn’t Paper but Blade.</p>
<p>It was Paper and now it’s Blade. Don’t tell me the next one is Rock? Although he didn’t know why they differed, he still followed his plans. He fused the Mutated Skeleton Ant, Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and Truth Listener into the blood-colored avatar and prepared for a full-power skirmish.</p>
<p>Although the Demonized General was strong, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant wasn’t weak, especially when it came to Speed. It was definitely not weaker than any Legendary dimensional creature.</p>
<p>The Demonized General’s attack was identical to the one he previously encountered. The strange spear in its hand swept over with blazing flames, but Zhou Wen managed to dodge it by flying</p>
<p>He didn’t rejoice when he dodged the strange spear’s attack. He continued staring intently at the Demonized General’s left hand.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the spear missed, the Demonized General raised its left hand just as Zhou Wen had expected.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the Demonized General didn’t suck the blood-colored avatar over. Instead, it transformed its palm into a blade and waved it at it.</p>
<p>The faint red blade aura tore out like a thin thread, instantly cleaving the blood-colored avatar’s waist, an attack that even the silver wings were unable to dodge.</p>
<p>The blade aura flashed past the blood-colored avatar’s waist, slicing it into two. It then plummeted from the sky and the screen turned black</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confused when he saw the black screen. The left-hand technique of Paper is suction, while Blade has a blade aura that’s as fast as lightning. If there’s Rock, would it be a powerful punch that strikes from afar?</p>
<p>He didn’t immediately revive the blood-colored avatar to try again. He carefully considered the battle and quickly realized that he was unlikely to defeat the Paper Demonized General with only the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, he had a chance of defeating the Blade Demonized General.</p>
<p>The suction force of the Paper Demonized General’s palm was something the Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn’t avoid. However, the extremely fast Blade aura of the Blade Demonized General could be avoided if Silver-Winged Flying Ant was used properly. This also meant that Zhou Wen had the chance of killing a Blade Demonized General.</p>
<p>This was if the Silver-Winged Flying Ant fought alone. If it fused with the blood-colored avatar as a companion form, there was zero chance.</p>
<p>This was because, in its companion form, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was unable to use its talent skills. And since Zhou Wen hadn’t had the Silver-Winged Flying Ant Primordial Energy Skill drop, he wasn’t able to use such flight-capable skills. Therefore, he ended up losing his advantage after fusion.</p>
<p>Heavens, show your grace on me. Let me encounter a Blade Demonized General again. Zhou Wen entered the dungeon once more, but luck was clearly not on his side. After repeatedly grinding, he didn’t encounter any word-engraved Demonized General outside Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>He spent several days in his dorm grinding without attending class. Li Xuan visited him a few times, hoping to invite him to complete the test at Tiger Cage Pass, but Zhou Wen would decline with some excuse.</p>
<p>Wang Fei constantly monitored her students in secret and discovered that most students had diligently done their research and formed teams to attempt slaying the Demonized General at Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were the only ones in class who didn’t do a thing. Excluding their first visit to Tiger Cage Pass, there had been no sight of them again.</p>
<p>n no</p>
<p>I can ignore Li Xuan, but what’s Zhou Wen doing? Why didn’t he head to Tiger Cage Pass to complete the mission? Wang Fei was rather curious about Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had a good relationship with Ouyang Lan and knew how proud and doting she was as a mother. Even a woman like Ouyang Lan had given Zhou Wen an extremely high appraisal and had even given the rights that should have been An Jing’s to Zhou Wen. This had piqued Wang Fei’s curiosity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had showcased impressive potential back in his participation in the slaying of the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, so this deepened her curiosity.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t have thought much about it if Zhou Wen had completed the mission at Tiger Cage Pass without any fuss, but there was nothing from him for several days. This just intrigued her even more.</p>
<p>Wang Fei clearly wasn’t a patient person. Since she was curious, she decided to visit Zhou Wen at his dorm to see what he was doing.</p>
<p>And in a room in a particular part of Luoyang City, Liz excitedly came to Qiao Siyuan with an arrest warrant. “Minister Qiao, the arrest warrant has been granted. Shall we take immediate action?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan nodded slightly. “Take some men to Sunset College. However, don’t use the arrest warrant. Get the school to bring Zhou Wen over under the guise of getting him to aid in investigations. If he’s cooperative, bring him back. If not, you’ll have to use the warrant. Try not to garner the notice of too many people when you do it, especially the An family.”</p>
<p>“Minister, rest assured. I know what needs to be done. I’ll definitely bring Zhou Wen back,” Liz said confidently.</p>
<p>“Go then. Come back quickly. We don’t have much time. We have to get what we need to know before the An family sends someone, so it has to be fast,” Qiao Siyuan exhorted once more.</p>
<p>Liz obeyed the order and took men to Sunset College. Then, in the name of needing Zhou Wen to aid in investigations, she met the school’s managing vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>If they were ordinary police, they probably wouldn’t be able to meet the managing vice-chancellor. However, being in the Special Inspector Bureau allowed Liz a meeting.</p>
<p>In the League, the Special Inspector Bureau was feared and hated by everyone. Although the vice-chancellor didn’t wish to involve himself with Liz and company, he had no choice but to talk to them.</p>
<p>The entire League knew of many high-ranking officials that had their reputations ruined after entering the Special Inspector Bureau. If one was targeted by this bureau, severe loss or even death was certain.</p>
<p>“Chancellor, rest assured. We just wish to invite a few witnesses to provide us with some information. It won’t take too much of these students’ time,” Liz said with a smile.</p>
<p>There was a name list on the managing vice-chancellor’s desk, one with a total of six names. They were all Sunset College students, but five of them were just a ruse. Zhou Wen was the person she really wanted.</p>
<p>“Alright then.” The managing vice-chancellor didn’t wish to offend the Special Inspector Bureau because of such trivialities, so he got his secretary to summon the students on the list.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was gaming in his dorm when he received the notice to head to the school’s administrative building. He had no idea why the chancellor was summoning him.</p>
<p>Knocking on the door and entering the office, he instantly saw Liz who was sitting there drinking tea. He immediately knew that things weren’t good, but he knew that escape was futile. All he could do was pretend to not recognize her and walk in calmly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter81'>Chapter 81 Stalling For Time</h3>
<p>“This female officer wishes to ask you a few questions. Just answer truthfully,” the vice-chancellor said to Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Liz didn’t look like she was targeting Zhou Wen. She asked all six students some questions and treated him the same as though she didn’t know him.</p>
<p>“Officer, will that do?” the vice-chancellor asked after Liz was done with her questioning.</p>
<p>“The other students can head back now. However, I would like to invite Mr. Zhou Wen back to assist us in our investigations.” Liz waved her hand, permitting the other students to leave the office as she scrutinized him as though speaking casually.</p>
<p>The vice-chancellor frowned slightly but soon smiled. “Officer, you naturally can get our students to assist in your investigations, but as you know, Sunset College is considered half a military school. These students can be considered part of the military reserve force. If you wish to take him away, you will need to go through the procedures. If you are in a rush for time, I can do the paperwork for you now.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. This is an arrest warrant. Take a look at it. I’ll only be taking him with me to assist in our investigations. We will bring him back unharmed, so you don’t have to worry,” Liz said with a sneer as she took out the arrest warrant, placing it on the desk in front of the vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>How could she not be aware that the vice-chancellor was a sly old fox? Despite speaking pleasantly, he was probably planning to head out to inform the An family. Sunset College has been set up by the An family to begin with, so if anything were to happen, they wouldn’t sit idle even if they didn’t like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The vice-chancellor looked at the arrest warrant carefully and immediately, his expression changed. He glared at Liz and asked, “What law did our student break? To actually use an arrest warrant of this level?”</p>
<p>He could already tell that Liz was here for Zhou Wen. Whatever excuses previously used had been solely to get Zhou Wen here.</p>
<p>“No comment,” Liz said as she gestured for her man to apprehend Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She knew that she couldn’t waste any time. She needed to take Zhou Wen away before the Ans came.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was the An family’s only candidate, one that couldn’t be changed. Ignoring his importance to the An family, to request they hand him over without any concrete evidence was something they would definitely disagree with.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Zhou Wen under the An family’s supervision was nearly useless. It was basically telling Zhou Wen that they couldn’t do a thing to him, so how could they get anything out of him?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Qiao Siyuan also suspected that the An family was involved in this matter. This was also one of the reasons he needed to take Zhou Wen back for interrogation.</p>
<p>As for killing Zhou Wen, not only was Liz fearful of doing so, but even Qiao Siyuan wouldn’t do so. The An family had Zhou Wen as their only candidate, so killing him was equivalent to crossing them. Qiao Siyuan didn’t wish to completely offend them; at least he wouldn’t do so until he had concrete evidence.</p>
<p>Of course, if he could obtain actual evidence from Zhou Wen that the An family was involved with Jing Daoxian, that would be a whole different matter.</p>
<p>The possibility was very small to begin with; therefore, Liz didn’t really have much hope of obtaining such evidence. She only wanted to take Zhou Wen back and question him about the things that Qiao Siyuan wanted to know before the An family arrived.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately hid behind the vice-chancellor’s back. He had heard Li Xuan describe the modus operandi of the Special Inspection Bureau-a place that was enough to figuratively skin a person no matter who they were. For them to have spent so much effort to come all the way to Sunset College to arrest him, he clearly wasn’t going to be released after a simple interrogation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen felt guilty. After all, he had cultivated Jing Daoxian’s Lost Immortal Sutra. If the bureau were to believe that this Primordial Energy Art was related to Jing Daoxian, wouldn’t that make him his accomplice?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that Jing Daoxian hadn’t cultivated in the Lost Immortal Sutra himself because it wasn’t his. Even if others were to recognize the Lost Immortal Sutra, it was impossible to connect him to Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one in the League had ever mastered the Lost Immortal Sutra, so it was almost impossible to recognize.</p>
<p>“Officer, you should know that Overseer An shows great concern about Sunset College. Shouldn’t you inform him of this?” the vice-chancellor said with a frown.</p>
<p>Liz said in all seriousness, “The League’s laws are supreme. I don’t care where this is or who’s here. I’m duty-bound to do what needs to be done. It doesn’t matter who comes. Chancellor, are you implying that Overseer An is greater than the League’s laws?”</p>
<p>“You are taking me out of context. On this matter, our Sunset College will definitely seek an explanation from Congress.” The vice-chancellor’s face was livid.</p>
<p>“Feel free to do so.” Liz knew that she couldn’t waste any more time. She had to leave immediately with Zhou Wen, so she gave her men the signal.</p>
<p>Two men moved like phantoms as they tried to take Zhou Wen away by force.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch me. I can walk by myself.” Zhou Wen knew that the school was powerless against them since the vice-chancellor didn’t stop them.</p>
<p>“Alright, move along.” Liz wasn’t afraid that Zhou Wen could do much. She waved her hand, giving the silent order to her subordinates not to touch him and let Zhou Wen walk by himself.</p>
<p>She didn’t wish to blow matters up if things could be done in a furtive manner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t resist as he obediently walked out. The two men walked behind him, prepared to immediately restrain him if he did anything abnormal.</p>
<p>“Chancellor Ya, goodbye for now,” Liz said and directly walked off.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dawdle as he directly walked towards the school’s entrance.</p>
<p>He was lacking in EQ, but it didn’t mean he was dumb.</p>
<p>Liz had tricked him and was now eagerly taking him away. Although she spoke in an overbearing manner, he could tell that there were things holding them back. Their eagerness was apparently because they were afraid of something.</p>
<p>Every second I stall counts. Zhou Wen didn’t have the opportunity to send an SOS message. From the moment he entered the room and saw Liz, he knew that he wasn’t able to do so under Liz’s nose. Therefore, he hadn’t made any attempts to prevent himself from being taken into custody immediately. It might even cause his mysterious phone to be confiscated.</p>
<p>However, believing that the vice-chancellor would have already sent out the news, all he needed to do was stall for time to have a turnaround.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it was clearly impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to escape from a few Legendary officers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept walking towards the school’s entrance without acting out of place. Nor did he take any detours. He made Liz and the officers believe that he had stopped resisting and was returning with them.</p>
<p>In fact, even high officials of the League wouldn’t try anything funny if they were under the bureau’s control, much less a student.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked normally as though he had resigned himself to fate. But when he arrived near a forest within the campus grounds, he suddenly exerted full force and dashed into the woods. As he ran, he said, “I need to pee. Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>By passing through the forest, he was already close to the entrance of Underground Buddha City in the real world. As long as he could escape into it, he could use the Small Buddha Temple’s mysterious forces to stall for time.</p>
<p>Although doing so was risky as he still didn’t know if Small Buddha Temple in the real world was identical to the game, he no longer had the luxury of choice. He had things on him he absolutely couldn’t expose.</p>
<p>If he were to be taken away for interrogation, all the items on him would be scrutinized—the mysterious phone would thus be exposed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter82'>Chapter 82 Escape</h3>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen escape, Liz watched with a teasing look without any intention to take action.</p>
<p>The bureau arrested and pursued people daily. If a student at the Mortal stage were to escape under their noses, they could forget about staying in the bureau.</p>
<p>Without needing Liz to give the word, the two officers behind Zhou Wen reached out their hands to grab him. Speed at the Legendary stage emerged as four hands seemed to lock onto Zhou Wen’s arms like phantoms.</p>
<p>But in that split second, a silver glow flashed behind Zhou Wen. Four silver wings extended and with one flap, he flew seven to eight meters high. He was incredibly fast and unexpectedly dodged the officers’ attacks, successfully rushing into the forest.</p>
<p>“A Legendary Companion Beast capable of flight… Chase after him…” Liz was slightly taken aback, but she immediately led the chase after snapping back to her senses.</p>
<p>They originally imagined that it would be impossible for Zhou Wen to escape from the Legendaries even with his Legendary Companion Beast, but to their surprise, Zhou Wen was like a nimble bat. He flapped his four wings and darted through the woods, using the trees to conceal his motion. He cut off their attempts to encircle him as he rushed out of the woods.</p>
<p>“I want to see how far you can go!” Liz was alarmed and infuriated. She chased Zhou Wen at an unimaginably fast speed.</p>
<p>Without the woods concealing his actions, Zhou Wen was unable to pull open the distance between them. All he could do was rush towards Ancient Inlet, that wasn’t too far away, at full speed, rushing into Underground Buddha City before Liz and company could catch up to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen showed his pass and directly entered Underground Buddha City. However, Liz and company were stopped by the soldiers who were guarding it. After they revealed their identification as bureau officers, they were permitted into Underground Buddha City to continue the pursuit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even turn his head as he ran towards Small Buddha Temple at full speed. Liz and company chased him relentlessly and were closing up to him despite the Speed he obtained with the wings obtained from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you know what crime it is to resist arrest? We originally only required you to return to assist us with our investigations. Now that you’re escaping, that will compound the crime. It’s still not too late for you to stop now,” Liz shouted as she chased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen completely ignored her as he dashed forward at full speed.</p>
<p>Liz knew that she couldn’t waste any more time when she saw Zhou Wen running in silence. Gritting her teeth, she summoned an azure sword and slashed it towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>An azure sword beam appeared immediately, traversing several meters as it headed straight for Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard the sound of wind as he hurriedly dodged with a sidestep, barely dodging the sword beam’s slash. Without another word, he continued running forward.</p>
<p>He originally only had the thought of finding an opportunity to hide the mysterious phone, but with Liz’s tight pursuit, they weren’t giving him a chance to do so. All he could do was desperately escape in the direction of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>“My name isn’t Liz if you escape me today!” Liz was infuriated and couldn’t care less. She slashed out with her sword repeatedly.</p>
<p>Although the sword beams weren’t aimed at Zhou Wen’s vital spots, it was enough to grievously injure him.</p>
<p>Due to him dodging the sword beams, Zhou Wen’s speed immediately dropped. This allowed the other officers to catch up to him. They didn’t stand on ceremony as they cast several Primordial Energy Skills at him.</p>
<p>They were experienced veterans and attacked viciously in a non-lethal manner. It was solely to heavily injure him so that he could be taken back.</p>
<p>A huge burst of blood shot out of Zhou Wen’s thigh as Liz’s sword beam sliced across it. The blood continued gushing out of the laceration.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued dashing forward in silence, but the injuries he suffered kept increasing. Although they weren’t lethal, his wounds were extremely horrifying.</p>
<p>Liz was also alarmed. Although Zhou Wen was augmented by a Legendary Companion Beast and he was flying very quickly, he was ultimately at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Under their relentless attacks, he only suffered injuries without succumbing. Although he looked seriously injured, he had avoided having his vital parts injured. He hadn’t suffered any serious damage.</p>
<p>This definitely had to do with Liz and company having no intention of really killing Zhou Wen, but he had been able to avoid any injuries that were enough to put him out of combat.</p>
<p>Many times, Zhou Wen was able to dodge an attack at the final moment even without taking a look. It was as though he had eyes in the back of his head. This shocked Liz greatly.</p>
<p>This Zhou Wen is so calm in battle. Even when injured, he chooses to allow himself to be injured to minimize the overall damage. He’s terrifyingly calm. It’s unbelievable that he’s only sixteen. Liz looked at the bloody Zhou Wen flying off with a resolute look in his eyes. Her heart stirred as she thought, It’s no wonder the An family chose him. It’s probably not just because of the relationship between Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fought as he retreated. After his body was injured, his Lost Immortal Sutra automatically switched to Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. What further surprised him was that his wound pulled together to exert compression and prevent blood from gushing out just like Li Xuan.</p>
<p>I never expected the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to have such ingenious uses. Zhou Wen was quite surprised.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra allowed Zhou Wen’s Constitution to exceed 10—the only stat that reached 11. Therefore, it definitely boosted Constitution, but he had no idea what it did.</p>
<p>The Small Buddha Temple’s stone staircase was already in sight. It had a metal fence barricading it with a forbidden zone sign to prevent students from accidentally venturing in.</p>
<p>Small Buddha Temple didn’t have troops guarding it because it was unnecessary. If someone was really able to enter Small Buddha Temple and master the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, the military would be very happy.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of similar, mysterious places in the world, but less than 10% of them had been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to the fence as his left arm conjured the skeleton bracer. He tore a huge hole through the fence and immediately crawled through it.</p>
<p>Liz and company weren’t from Luoyang, so they knew little about the recently discovered Buddha City. Although they saw the forbidden zone sign, they continued their pursuit.</p>
<p>Firstly, Liz needed to capture Zhou Wen as soon as possible. Secondly, with Zhou Wen in front of them, he would end up bearing all the dangers first. Therefore, she didn’t hesitate to rush in with her men.</p>
<p>In the narrow rock passageway ahead, the space that allowed him to dodge decreased. Liz managed to slash a beam on Zhou Wen’s back, causing him to trigger the Lotus Flower Buddha Body skill. However, a long bloody gash cleaved open on his back as he was thrown forward. He spat out blood when he slammed onto the stone steps high above.</p>
<p>Liz approached Zhou Wen with a sword in hand as she said coldly, “Zhou Wen, you’re cornered. Stop having illusions that you can escape. Returning with us to assist in the case will only benefit you,”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shot a look at Liz and company who had managed to catch up to him. Wiping away the blood that trickled from the corner of his mouth, he said indifferently, “Why would I be escaping? You are the ones who should be escaping.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter83'>Chapter 83 Stalemate at the Stone Stairs</h3>
<p>“Madman.” Liz ignored what Zhou Wen had said. She gestured with her hand for the officers to head over and apprehend the heavily injured Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She had already wasted too much time, far more than she had originally planned. It was already hard to tell if they could take Zhou Wen away before the An family came. She couldn’t afford to waste any more time.</p>
<p>The few officers lunged forward. By heading higher, the stone stairs had broadened. They were no longer as narrow as before, allowing them to rush up together.</p>
<p>But this time, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately run. He sat at the top of the stairs, striking forward at the officer that led the charge.</p>
<p>This strike seemed soft and powerless as though he hadn’t exerted a sliver of strength. The officer was nearly two meters away, so not even his sleeves were touched.</p>
<p>Liz and the few officers naturally didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the ability to strike them from a distance. Skills that could project Primordial Energy was considered a minority even at the Legendary stage, so it was impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to master such a skill. Even if there was one, someone at the Mortal stage didn’t have the Primordial Energy needed to support the expenditure.</p>
<p>However, with Zhou Wen’s gentle strike, the officer silently collapsed to the ground. It instantly shocked the rest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he repeatedly struck the air. In response, the remaining officers collapsed in the zone as though their souls had been dissipated.</p>
<p>Liz was stunned and bewildered, nearly unable to believe her own eyes. The few Legendary officers had clearly stopped breathing; yet, she couldn’t tell how they had been killed by Zhou Wen. Her eyes flickered with a glint of shock and puzzlement. Momentarily, she didn’t dare approach him.</p>
<p>Yet Zhou Wen knew very well that they hadn’t been killed by him. Instead, it was the mysterious force of the stone stairs and Small Buddha Temple that robbed them of their lives.</p>
<p>However, no one knew this mysterious force better than Zhou Wen. He had accurately estimated the moment of the officers’ death and just posed with a strike. It was simply to scare them off.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that Liz wasn’t affected by the stone stairs’ force; otherwise, she should have been lying dead.</p>
<p>Strange, don’t tell me Liz possesses a Primordial Energy Skill similar to Heart Meditation? That’s why she hasn’t been killed by that mysterious force? But that’s not right. Even if she has something like that, she doesn’t know the secret of this place. She wouldn’t be using it ahead of time… What’s happening?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he didn’t show it. He continued sitting on the stone stairs with a leisurely look, looking down at Liz with an air of superiority. “I didn’t want to kill, but why did you have to force me?”</p>
<p>His words were half-truths. If Liz hadn’t forced him, he definitely wouldn’t wish them dead, much less make people from the bureau die.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if he could explain their deaths clearly in the future, with the possibility of the League putting him on a wanted list.</p>
<p>But even so, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to expose the secret of his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>At most I’ll be a fugitive, escaping into dimensional zones that aren’t within human control. As long as I have the mysterious phone, the dangers of the dimensional zones are nonexistent to me. Zhou Wen made up his mind that if he were truly cornered, he would have to become a wanted fugitive.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to act all mysterious. Do you think you can fool me?” Liz didn’t believe that a student like Zhou Wen at the Mortal stage could possess such terrifying power.</p>
<p>However, she was unable to instantly tell how the four officers had died. This hesitance made her lack the courage to directly rush forward.</p>
<p>“You can give it a try if you don’t believe it. Let’s see if my Formless Divine Palm is capable of killing you,” Zhou Wen said with a deadpan expression as though he had everything in the</p>
<p>bag.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was lamenting inwardly, I’ve already stalled for so long. Even without Heart Meditation’s protection, no matter how strong Liz is, she should have died on the stone stairs. Why is she completely fine?</p>
<p>“What Formless Divine Palm? I’ve never heard of it.” Liz kept staring at Zhou Wen and the four dead officers in an attempt to figure out the reason for their deaths.</p>
<p>“The Formless Divine Palm is colorless and shadowless. It kills people in an invisible manner, a Primordial Energy Skill Ouyang Lan gave me. It was meant to protect me, and I usually wouldn’t readily use it. If you hadn’t cornered me today, I wouldn’t have used such a vile Primordial Energy Skill.” Zhou Wen spoke nonsense, but he was considering how he could escape.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe he could really scare Liz. She hadn’t rushed up because she hadn’t figured out how her four colleagues had died and was unwilling to take the risk.</p>
<p>Liz was doubtful of Zhou Wen’s words. It was true she couldn’t tell how the deaths occurred because they didn’t seem to have any injuries at all.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea came to Liz. She recalled the forbidden zone sign she had seen and immediately came to a realization. She sized up her surroundings and sneered. “Then, let me try and see how your Formless Divine Palm can kill me!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Liz summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It had pure-white wings and supple skin and was dressed in a white gown. It resembled the mythical angel but had one thing that was different. This angel Companion Beast didn’t have a head. It was empty from the neck up.</p>
<p>“Headless Angel!” Zhou Wen immediately cried out when he saw the headless angel.</p>
<p>Headless Angel was very famous as a Companion Beast. Although it came from the League’s West district, its name had already spread across Earth’s League.</p>
<p>Headless Angel wasn’t a true angel, but a figure in western legend.</p>
<p>Legend had it that a pious nun believed in God with the purest heart, hoping that she could one day ascend to heaven to serve God as an angel.</p>
<p>Every person who saw the nun believed that she was the purest and most flawless person in the world. Therefore, everyone who knew her believed that she was bound to ascend to the heavenly kingdom after her death, becoming an angel who would serve God.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nun’s devotion moved God. One day, God descended before the nun and cast a divine light down on Earth, purifying the nun’s body into that of an angel’s.</p>
<p>Just as the nun’s body was being transformed into an angel’s body, she saw a prisoner on death row piously praying and confessing to God.</p>
<p>Hence, the nun asked God, “That prisoner is so pious. Can you absolve him of his sins?”</p>
<p>God answered, “I can, but his sins need to be burdened by someone. If you agree, you can replace the prisoner at the guillotine and bear his sins.”</p>
<p>After hearing that, the nun resolutely chose to bear the sins for the prisoner. Hence, with a flash of divine light, the prisoner at the guillotine was switched to the nun who was quickly transforming into an angel. Before her body could completely turn into an angel’s, her head was chopped off.</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>Although her head had been chopped off, the other parts of her body were already that of an angel. It was an unaging and immortal body that didn’t die because of a beheading.</p>
<p>However, the head wasn’t able to recover due to it not being angelized. Therefore, the nun became the legendary Headless Angel in western legend.</p>
<p>Although the name was terrifying, a Headless Angel was synonymous with purity in the West district.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, inside one dimensional zone in the West district, a Headless Angel dimensional creature appeared. It was later slain by humanity and its Companion Egg obtained.</p>
<p>As such, the Headless Angel at the Epic stage became famous across Earth’s League. She wasn’t the greatest at combat strength but she was great for protection.</p>
<p>With the protection of a Headless Angel, all kinds of evil forces like curses and hexes were unable to harm her master. It was to date, the strongest defensive Companion Beast in the West.</p>
<p>The master of Headless Angel relied on her defensive powers to explore dimensional zones amidst many mysterious dangers-ones that humanity believed were forbidden-returning safely every time.</p>
<p>Hence, the fame of Headless Angel intensified. But based on what Zhou Wen knew, there was only one Headless Angel Companion Beast, and its owner wasn’t Liz.</p>
<h3 id='chapter84'>Chapter 84 Headless Angel</h3>
<p>Headless Angel wasn’t a Companion Beast with offensive traits. Its body appeared like a holy halo that floated in front of Liz.</p>
<p>Liz extended her hand and beckoned, causing the Headless Angel’s body to quickly transform into a white crucifix that landed in Liz’s palm.</p>
<p>The crucifix suffused a holy glow that made Liz appear like a goddess with it in hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally understood why Liz hadn’t been killed by Small Buddha Temple’s mysterious force. It was likely due to the Headless Angel’s protection.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate to turn around and flap his wings to fly towards Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>The wings the Silver-Winged Flying Ant manifested gave Zhou Wen Speed that was in no way inferior to a pinnacle Legendary. He instantly rushed to the entrance of Small Buddha Temple at the end of the stone stairs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t wish to risk entering Small Buddha Temple in real life, but now wasn’t the time to consider that. All he could do was enter to seek refuge.</p>
<p>“Continue running and I’ll cut off your legs.” Liz’s voice was cold as she held the Headless Angel’s crucifix. Like a panther, she chased after Zhou Wen with a sword in her hand. She then slashed it at Zhou Wen’s thigh like it was a whip.</p>
<p>Liz had previously held back due to her qualms with regards to the An family.</p>
<p>However, the death of the four officers had triggered Liz’s rage. All she wanted to do was take Zhou Wen back alive. She had zero other scruples.</p>
<p>The strike was exceedingly fast as the sword beam instantly arrived behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Summoning the Silver-Winged Flying Ant with clenched teeth, he made it watch his back as he rushed into Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>At the same moment Zhou Wen rushed into Small Buddha Temple, he heard a creaking sound behind him. When he looked back, he saw the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s two foreclaws cleaved apart by Liz. Even its forehead had a bloody gash that was seeping blood.</p>
<p>Reality wasn’t a game, so the Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn’t be revived if it died. With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned it back as he continued running into the temple hall at full speed.</p>
<p>Without the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s wings to help him, his speed was much slower.</p>
<p>The environment inside the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was identical to the game. The first thing he saw when he entered the Small Buddha Temple’s compound was the stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra inscribed on it.</p>
<p>In reality, the stone monument looked even more ancient and spartan as though it had suffered the ravages of time. The mottled exterior made it look even more rugged as if there was an indescribable charm to it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered with it. He circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra as fast as he could before rushing into the temple hall.</p>
<p>Liz followed closely behind as she slashed her sword at Zhou Wen’s thigh again without any hesitation. It was as though she wanted to lop off both of his legs.</p>
<p>Even without turning his head, Zhou Wen was able to know that the sword beam was already behind him, due to Truth Listener.</p>
<p>He leaped without any hesitation towards the temple hall.</p>
<p>In midair, he felt the bottom of his feet become chilly. His sports shoes were made of high-tech cloth and had their soles sliced off. Even some of the flesh on the sole of his feet wasn’t spared. The bleeding of his soles was rather harrowing.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had finally rushed into the temple hall and landed on the stone panes.</p>
<p>Buddha, please watch after me. Let the forces in this temple be effective against that woman; otherwise, that mad woman will definitely lop off my legs. As Zhou Wen retreated inside the temple, he prayed silently.</p>
<p>Under the Headless Angel crucifix’s protection, the forces of Small Buddha Temple seemed to lose all its original mystery, being completely useless against Liz.</p>
<p>Liz held the crucifix in one hand and sword in the other, dashing straight inside the temple hall.</p>
<p>However, at the instant one of her legs breached the temple hall’s interior, the three-faced Buddha statue inside suddenly widened its eyes.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The holy crucifix’s glow instantly exploded like a red-hot metal piece being shattered by a sledgehammer. The glow of the crucifix seemed to splatter like liquid and instantly became dim. It even seemed incomplete.</p>
<p>As though she had suffered a tremendous blow, her body flew backward and slammed into the stone monument, her mouth spewing out blood.</p>
<p>Liz struggled on the ground and failed to get to her feet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted and surprised by this, almost to the point of giving the statue a thumbs up and expressing his deepest feelings: ‘You’re awesome.’</p>
<p>Without thinking further, he summoned the injured Silver-Winged Flying Ant—its front claws had been sliced off and its head injury was serious. Thankfully, it hadn’t died.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen instructed it to conjure Magical Needle and shot at Liz.</p>
<p>At this stage, if he could retain everyone, Zhou Wen would still have the time to escape from Luoyang and into the unknown dimensional zones.</p>
<p>However, if he allowed Liz to escape and gather more people for a second wave of attacks, he probably wouldn’t have a chance of escaping</p>
<p>Liz could hardly move due to her serious injuries, but she was able to summon a Companion Beast that resembled both a tiger and a lion. It picked her up and dodged the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Magical Needle before rushing out of the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately carried out his pursuit, but the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was too injured and unable to maintain its companion form. Hence, he wasn’t able to catch up with her.</p>
<p>When he rushed to the stone staircase, the Legendary Companion Beast had already run far away with Liz.</p>
<p>Despite seeing that he couldn’t catch up to her, he continued pursuing while giving Li Xuan a call, explaining the entire situation to him.</p>
<p>He didn’t hope that Li Xuan could help him resist the bureau; he only hoped to get some suggestions from him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still a student, so he had limited horizons. Furthermore, he knew little about the bureau and wasn’t sure what was his best option.</p>
<p>Liz was enraged as she endured her injuries, rode the Companion Beast out of Underground Buddha City and headed for the school’s entrance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen resisting arrest was already a serious crime. She believed that she now had every right to mobilize the forces of the bureau to openly capture Zhou Wen without worrying about the An family.</p>
<p>“Immediately inform the Minister…” As Liz rushed out of the school gates, whilst trying to order the bureau officers outside the school to contact Qiao Siyuan, she suddenly stopped, stunned.</p>
<p>She saw the officers who often appeared high and mighty standing silently by the roadside with their heads bowed. Beside them were a row of soldiers aiming their rifles at them.</p>
<p>And on the road opposite them, there was a black sedan car. Beyond the rolled-down windows in the backseat, she saw a handsome man sitting there. He was looking straight at her.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo!” Liz couldn’t help but tremble when she saw the man.</p>
<p>Back when she was in the vice-chancellor’s office, she had claimed that she didn’t care if he came and would continue carrying out whatever she needed to do. However, when she actually saw An Tianzuo, everything was different.</p>
<p>This ridiculously young man had authority in the League that made even her uncles steal glances at him. Although she was about the same age as him, their level of accomplishment was on completely different levels.</p>
<p>“Overseer.” Liz endured her pains and came off the back of her Companion Beast, bowed at An Tianzuo, and forced a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter85'>Chapter 85 The An Family Has A Mine</h3>
<p>“Who gave you the guts to dare harm the students of Sunset College on its campus?” An Tianzuo asked Liz while sitting inside the car.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I’m Liz from the Special Investigation Bureau. I am under orders from Congress to arrest people related to Jing Daoxian…” Before Liz finished her sentence, she suddenly heard a bang.</p>
<p>She felt an intense pain and burning feeling coming from her left thigh. While crying out loud, she couldn’t help but fall to the ground on one knee as a bloody, gaping hole appeared on the side of her thigh. There were burn marks on her wound.</p>
<p>Besides the sedan car, a man in military uniform and white gloves holstered his pistol and said, “Answer whatever the Overseer asks, and nothing that he doesn’t ask.”</p>
<p>“How dare you fire at me? You…” Before Liz could finish her sentence, she heard another bang. A bullet had shot through her other leg, causing her to collapse to the ground with blood pooling around her.</p>
<p>“As the adjutant to the Overseer, I am obligated to remind you once more that you only need to answer the Overseer’s questions. If you say anything wrong or utter any unnecessary nonsense, the next thing to be crippled won’t be your legs,” the white-gloved man said gently with a smile.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because he had crippled Liz’s two legs, anyone would have mistaken him for a kind man who couldn’t bear to kill even a mosquito.</p>
<p>However, Liz’s forehead was breaking out into a cold sweat. It wasn’t just a result of the excruciating pain in her legs, but more a chill that came from deep down in her bones.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the white-gloved man raise his gun again and aim it at her head, Liz snapped to her senses and, ignoring the pain in her legs, shouted, “It was Minister Qiao Siyuan who sent me.”</p>
<p>At this moment, she had forgotten the status that she had always been proud of and her family’s standing in the League. She only knew that if she didn’t immediately answer the question, the seemingly harmless man would immediately blow her brains out.</p>
<p>Liz didn’t hesitate that the bullets within the gun had such might. Typical bullets could hardly injure her, but that didn’t include bullets made of Primordial Gold.</p>
<p>Very few materials could damage dimensional creatures on Earth, but Primordial Gold was one of them. And the An family controlled the biggest Primordial Gold mine in the League. The reserves it had covered more than 70% of the entire Earth League’s reserves. Wealthy tycoons who could extravagantly use Primordial Gold in bullets weren’t unheard of, but the An family was probably the only one to actually issue them to one’s troops.</p>
<p>“Call Qiao Siyuan,” An Tianzuo said mildly again, but it was a tone that didn’t permit any doubt.</p>
<p>The white-gloved adjutant handed a phone to Liz.</p>
<p>Liz didn’t hesitate and reached out to call Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan was feeling uneasy, having a nagging feeling that something was about to happen. Just as he was frowning in thought, he heard his phone ring.</p>
<p>It was an unknown number. Seemingly realizing something, he picked up the call and said, “I’m Qiao Siyuan. Who’s this?”</p>
<p>“I’m giving you five minutes. If I do not see you, all those who dared cross Sunset College will be executed by firing squad.” A male voice with a magnetic charm sounded from the phone.</p>
<p>“H… Hello…” Qiao Siyuan broke out into a cold sweat. He wanted to say something, but the phone emitted a loud beep, an indication that the call had already been disconnected.</p>
<p>What has Liz done? I clearly told her to be quick and bring Zhou Wen back before the An family arrived. Now, even An Tianzuo is there. Qiao Siyuan immediately felt his head ache, but he didn’t hesitate. He didn’t even put on the coat on his chair, he rushed straight out of the office, heading for Sunset College.</p>
<p>He was long aware of An Tianzuo’s style of doing things, but he never expected him to be so domineering to even dare execute a Senator’s daughter.</p>
<p>The League’s Congress was split into the Senate and the House. They were all representatives of the various areas of the League and were voted in by the citizens of each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Senate was different. There were perpetually six Senators, with only people from six families qualified to have a seat. They were the families of the Six League Heroes.</p>
<p>The Senate had veto rights for any bills the House proposed. It could be said that the entire League’s government was in fact controlled by these six families.</p>
<p>Every League President was also selected from one of the six families.</p>
<p>And the Special Investigation Bureau that Qiao Siyuan was from came directly under the Senate. Under the insistence of the Senate, agencies like the Special Investigation Bureau, which were hated by all, continued their existence in the League.</p>
<p>Liz wasn’t considered a smart woman, and her work ethic had never left Qiao Siyuan assured. However, as she was a daughter of a Senator, he had no choice but to keep her by his side.</p>
<p>If Liz was really executed by An Tianzuo, Qiao Siyuan didn’t dare imagine what the outcome would be. He didn’t know if An Tianzuo would die as a result, but he knew that his death was a certainty. There was no question about it.</p>
<p>Outside Sunset College, the nearby road had been sealed off by the soldiers. The students and passersby didn’t know what was happening and could only circle around it.</p>
<p>“How long has it been?” An Tianzuo looked at the sky outside and asked casually.</p>
<p>“4:43,” the adjutant looked at his watch and politely replied.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t say a word as he waved his hand. Immediately, a row of soldiers raised their rifles, aiming their black muzzles at the back of Liz’s and other officers’ heads.</p>
<p>Liz was trembling. She had never felt this afraid before because she could tell that An Tianzuo really had no scruples about killing her.</p>
<p>She really wished to say that she was a Senator’s daughter and declare her identity, but she was afraid that the moment she spoke, the seemingly harmless and perpetually smiling adjutant would blow her brains out.</p>
<p>“Overseer, it’s time,” the adjutant turned and politely said to An Tianzuo after looking at his watch.</p>
<p>“Then, proceed with the execution,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Overseer Sir, please wait.” A voice suddenly sounded from the sky as a figure flapped two wings and rushed down from the sky.</p>
<p>The person who landed on the ground with his clothes soaked in sweat was none other than Qiao Siyuan. He had rushed over at such speed that he nearly had a heart attack. Thankfully, he had arrived just in time.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Liz’s crippled legs, Qiao Siyuan’s heart was filled with agony.</p>
<p>“You’re Qiao Siyuan?” Although An Tianzuo sat in the car, making his eye level much lower than Qiao Siyuan’s, the way he looked at him was as though he was looking from high above.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan walked to the car and said politely, “I’m Qiao Siyuan from the Special Investigation Bureau, Overseer Sir. Can we have a private chat?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter86'>Chapter 86 Heaven is on the Right</h3>
<p>“There’s nothing that needs to be hidden. Just say it straight,” An Tianzuo said indifferently, without looking at Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s heart skipped a bit, aware that there was likely no way of conciliating the matter today.</p>
<p>“Overseer, Liz and the rest were just acting under orders from our people higher-up. This matter has nothing to do with them. Can they be sent to the hospital?” Qiao Siyuan drew a deep breath and said.</p>
<p>“Who are the people higher-up,” An Tianzuo continued asking with the same expression.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you should have heard of Jing Daoxian, right?”</p>
<p>“The League’s vilest criminal.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan continued, “Jing Daoxian slaughtered many high-ranking members of the League at the League government office. It halved our League’s strongest combat strength and set back our overall strength by ten years. The Senate has always placed the utmost importance on Jing Daoxian. Over the years, the League has been trying all means to pursue him. Our Special Investigation Bureau has also been putting in great efforts towards this cause. Just a few days ago, we discovered that Jing Daoxian had interacted with Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so are you implying that Zhou Wen is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian?” An Tianzuo shot Qiao Siyuan a look.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan shook his head and said, “We are still unable to confirm if they are in cahoots; therefore, we wanted to invite Zhou Wen back to assist in our investigations. Overseer, you are of noble birth, but the responsibilities you bear are unimaginable to the typical person. It’s not easy for you nor the An family. Why should you burden yourself with nagging tongues because of a huge problem like Jing Daoxian? Besides, didn’t you once criticize Zhou Wen and say that there was a problem with him?”</p>
<p>“So are you saying I should thank you?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Overseer, I’ll just be extremely grateful if you can understand where we are coming from.” Qiao Siyuan felt more and more uneasy as he forced a smile.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at Qiao Siyuan with a faint smile. “I did criticize Zhou Wen and I do find him a sore sight. But how I criticize or bully him is down to my whims, did I say that any Tom, Dick, and Harry could bully him?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s expression instantly changed. He forced a smile and said, “Overseer, you’re absolutely right. We’ll definitely change for the better. We will definitely inform you of any operations that involve the An family in the future.”</p>
<p>“Not a bad attitude. Alright, I’m not an unreasonable person. Since you have said this much, I’ll spare their lives,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Overseer. I’m truly grateful. Feel free to issue me orders if there’s anything you need of me,” Qiao Siyuan quickly said.</p>
<p>“They can be spared from death, but not punishment. Otherwise, wouldn’t any Tom, Dick, and Harry come to Luoyang to do as they please? Are the League’s laws to be flouted?” An Tianzuo spoke another sentence, one that was completely different from the previous one.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan long knew that An Tianzuo wouldn’t let this matter rest easily as he grumbled inwardly, You are the one who’s best at flouting the League’s laws.</p>
<p>“You can take them back with you, but cripple them of their cultivation to prevent them from using it to run amok,” An Tianzuo said casually.</p>
<p>Liz was horrified when she heard that as she yelled crazily, “No… No… You can’t cripple me of my cultivation…”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s expression changed drastically as he said through gritted teeth, “They were just obeying orders and there’s nothing wrong with that. Overseer, if you were to punish them, what does this make of the Senate? You should also know the League’s present situation. The President and the Senators have spared no effort dealing with matters regarding Jing Daoxian. If you were to implicate yourself in this matter, wouldn’t it give a great opportunity to those people who are watching you and eyeing the An family’s Primordial Gold mine? Liz’s father is Senator Cape. If you give Liz a chance, Senator Cape and the entire Cape family will be very grateful. In the future, he will definitely help the An family at congressional meetings. A thought separates heaven from hell. Overseer Sir, you must think about it carefully.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo looked at Qiao Siyuan in contempt and said, “Qiao Siyuan, do you know why my name is An Tianzuo?”.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not. Please tell me, I’m all ears.”</p>
<p>“As the saying goes Heaven[1] is on the right, and Hell is on the left. And I incline towards the left[2],” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Liz let out a painful cry as the adjutant drew an exquisite knife, stabbing into her Primordial Energy sea. Blood stained the hand holding the knife, turning the white gloves red.</p>
<p>“Remember, Luoyang belongs to the An family.” An Tianzuo looked forward as his car windows wound up, slowly hiding his face.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Wen was hurriedly sneaking out of Sunset College via the back door. Li Xuan had given him two suggestions. One was to head to the An family to seek their help in settling this matter. The second suggestion was to immediately hide in unknown dimensional zones, never to appear again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never wanted to have any relationship with the An family; therefore, he decided to flee into the dimensional zones. With the mysterious phone, unknown dimensional zones weren’t too dangerous for him.</p>
<p>He planned on escaping to the nearest, Dragon Gate Grotto. There were many dimensional zones in its vicinity that humans had yet to explore to date.</p>
<p>However, just as he left Sunset College’s back door, he saw a young, refined-looking military officer standing there in a military uniform and white gloves.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Madam has gotten Overseer to take you home for dinner.” As the young officer smiled, he revealed two rows of neat, white teeth, emitting a warm, comforting glow like the sun in spring.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen sat inside the car, beside him was the person whose name he knew but had never met before-An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>They had never met and had no ties in the past. But now, there was a particular relationship between them, making the mood rather delicate.</p>
<p>“You must hate me, right?” An Tianzuo suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected him to say this. However, he wasn’t someone with a high EQ, so he replied, “I wouldn’t call it hate, but I definitely ain’t fond of you.”</p>
<p>“Very good. This is what I want to say to you. I have never believed that you have the qualifications to replace Little Jing. It has been that way in the past, the present, and will be so in the future,” An Tianzuo’s gaze was peeled to the front as he spoke without expression.</p>
<p>“You are talking about An Jing? How did I replace her?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t reply but said indifferently, “I really don’t understand why my mom believes you are better than Little Jing. A man who only knows how to escape reality when encountering something doesn’t have the right to be called a man, much less be better than Little Jing.”</p>
<p>“I think you should visit a doctor and check if you have a screw loose in the head.” Zhou Wen felt that An Tianzuo was definitely crazy as he spoke in a completely baffling manner.</p>
<p>The adjutant, who was driving the car, couldn’t help but twitch when he heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>(1) Tian in An Tianzuo’s name can be interpreted as heaven.</p>
<p>[2] Zuo in An Tianzuo’s name is a homophone to left.</p>
<h3 id='chapter87'>Chapter 87 Special Physical Condition</h3>
<p>This was Zhou Wen’s second time at the An family home. Although An Tianzuo didn’t like him, what had that got to do with him?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat beside Ouyang Lan and focused on eating. He had a great time chatting with Ouyang Lan.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo and An Jing sat opposite him and focused on eating as well as though they couldn’t see him.</p>
<p>After dinner, Zhou Wen planned on bidding them farewell and leaving when Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and said, “Don’t be in a rush to leave. Have a walk with me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng got up and was about to accompany them when Ouyang Lan said with a smile, “It’s rare for Tianzuo to return. Help me nag him to get married and have children so that he can carry on the family line. Also, teach him how to coax women. You are the best at that.”</p>
<p>Zhou Lingfeng said with a bitter smile, “Can you not sully my reputation when you’re getting me to help?”</p>
<p>“This is me praising you,” Ouyang Lan said with a giggle as she headed out while holding Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>The An family home was really big and beautiful. As they walked on the stone trail inside the garden, Ouyang Lan said, “Little Wen, there’s something troublesome that I took the liberty of pushing the matter on you. Can you help me?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan sat on a bench by the side of the lawn and said in thought, “When you were in school, you must have heard of the story of the Six League Heroes, right?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “It’s how humanity first slew a Mythical creature. It was also them who established the League government and ended the darkest and most chaotic period of humanity.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said with a smile, “Establishing the League government is real, but it’s not necessarily true that darkness and chaos were ended.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s knowledge of this was limited to his textbooks, so he waited silently for Ouyang Lan to continue.</p>
<p>“Currently, the League appears to be stable and flourishing, but there are dark undercurrents surging. Something can happen anytime that develops into a cataclysm for human society,” Ouyang Lan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Is the cataclysm related to dimensional creatures?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The dimensional zones restrict the region of activity of dimensional creatures, but no one knows how long such restrictions can last. However, this isn’t the most pressing cataclysm at the moment.”</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan paused before continuing, “In fact, the greatest cataclysm now is humanity itself. The Six League Heroes established the League and on the surface, it promotes democracy and freedom, but in fact, the ones in true power are the Senate and President. And the selection of these people comes from the families of the Six League Heroes. Therefore, the League is in fact no different from an autocracy.</p>
<p>“And an autocracy needs absolute central power. But in this era, to have absolute rule clearly isn’t an easy task. At the very least, the families of the Six League Heroes do not have the absolute strength to control all of the Earth League. Even though they have been working hard for a number of years, it’s noticeable from the outcome, that their control over the League is constantly weakening. Currently, the League is more of a fragmented nation with rival factions.”</p>
<p>Upon saying that, Ouyang Lan cast her gaze on Zhou Wen and asked with a smile, “Do you know why the League remains stable and doesn’t completely collapse despite reaching such a state?”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“That’s because, in the League, only the families of the Six League Heroes have experts at the Mythical stage.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised. “Isn’t it said that no one in the League has broken through to the Mythical stage?”</p>
<p>“If one relied on themselves, it’s true that no one has been able to break through to the Mythical stage, but there’s a shortcut that allows humans to first obtain Mythical Companion Beasts and then by nurturing them, use their powers to advance to the Mythical stage. That’s why Mythical experts are born amongst the families of the Six League Heroes,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Then what’s the shortcut?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“You were chased into Small Buddha Temple by the Inspection Bureau. You should have seen the stone monument and temple hall. Engraved on the stone monument was a Primordial Energy Art. If you can master it, you can enter the temple hall and directly receive the mysterious powers from the dimension; thus, obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then as long as Small Buddha Temple is controlled, wouldn’t we be able to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast just like the families of the Six League Heroes?” Zhou Wen said, feigning surprise.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan shook her head. “It’s not that simple. To master the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument, one needs a special physique. And people with such bodies are one in a billion. In a place like Small Buddha Temple, there are far more than one or two that have been discovered in the League. However, the number of people who can truly master the mysterious Primordial Energy Art is a pathetic number.</p>
<p>“The six heroes all had special physiques. Furthermore, they found the mysterious lands that matched their bodies and mastered the mysterious Primordial Energy Arts, obtaining their Mythical Companion Beasts.” After a pause, Ouyang Lan continued, “However, the special physiques of their bodies weren’t innate, but obtained from a mysterious dimensional zone. There are still mysterious creatures inside it that can make other humans obtain special physiques like the six heroes; thus, obtaining a chance to acquire a Mythical Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“With such a place, the hero families probably do not wish to share it with others, right?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan curled her lips. “If they have the strength to suppress the entire League, they naturally won’t share it with others. Unfortunately, even if they have Mythical experts, it’s only limited to a few people. To suppress the massive Earth League is impossible. Besides, there are terrifying enemies overseas, beyond the League’s jurisdiction. The hero families can’t just put all their efforts on their own members.”</p>
<p>“Enemies overseas?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“The Earth League only controls the land. Overseas, there are other human factions in existence. I’ll tell you about them in detail in the future. To prevent the League from fracturing, the hero families have given the bigwigs of the various lands certain candidate spots, allowing the descendants of these bigwigs to have a chance of entering such mysterious lands. They will vie with the descendants of hero families for the chance to obtain special physiques. This temporarily stabilizes the League’s peace on the surface. As for the An family, it possesses one such spot.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you gave me the spot?” Zhou Wen suddenly realized something as he looked at Ouyang Lan in disbelief.</p>
<p>She nodded and said, “That spot was meant for Little Jing, and with her talent and capabilities, she had a very high chance of obtaining a special physique. Unfortunately, she was born with an ailment. As her mother, I don’t wish for her to take further risks. Therefore, I wish for you to replace Little Jing in this competition and obtain the special physique, thereby obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“I will need to ask for your forgiveness for changing our nominee to you without obtaining your permission. Furthermore, it can’t be changed again.” Ouyang Lan patted Zhou Wen on the head and said with a smile, “You don’t have to feel too pressured. I never planned on sending An Jing to begin with, so this spot would have been a waste. That’s why I changed it to you. So don’t worry if you aren’t willing to go.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter88'>Chapter 88 Entering Tiger Cage Pass Again</h3>
<p>“Why didn’t you give the nomination to An Tianzuo?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said with a smile, “Because he’s too strong. It’s useless sending him.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Ouyang Lan meant. However, he had a general idea. Perhaps the obtaining of a special condition limited one’s evolutionary level.</p>
<p>“Why did you give me the nomination?” Zhou Wen wasn’t silly enough to believe that this nomination would be for nothing.</p>
<p>Even if An Tianzuo and An Jing couldn’t do it, the An family could use this nomination to exchange for immense benefits. Many famous and noble families would be very interested in this nomination spot.</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, the An family could always give the spot to another collateral relative. It was a big family clan, so it would be easy for it to find someone suitable.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Little Wen, whether you believe it or not, since I’ve married Lingfeng, we should accept each other’s children. I’ll treat you as my own child. Of course, Tianzuo and Little Jing are my children, so my feelings for them go far deeper than yours. If all three of you were to encounter danger together, I’d definitely prioritize saving them. But other than that, I’ll do my best as a mother.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to do that.” Zhou Wen was actually quite fond of Ouyang Lan’s style.</p>
<p>She said, “You don’t have to feel psychologically burdened. This is just a thought of mine that I won’t force on you. If you wish, this family’s door is forever open to you. If you aren’t willing, I won’t get others to disturb you. Everything is up to you to choose.”</p>
<p>“Do you really believe that I can obtain the special physique?” Zhou Wen still found it inexplicable why Ouyang Lan was so confident in him.</p>
<p>Even someone as outstanding as An Jing wouldn’t have absolute confidence, and with Zhou Wen not yet having advanced to the Legendary stage, he was far inferior to An Jing to others.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan smiled as she raised her phone and opened the Photos app. She opened up a photo that had a refined, bespectacled old man on it.</p>
<p>“Do you know him?” Ouyang Lan pointed at the elderly man in the photo and asked.</p>
<p>“He’s the former principal…” Zhou Wen said in surprise. Back in Guide High School, he had been very taken care of by the former principal.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen spent most of his time living alone, he seldom returned home when he was in high school. He even spent the weekends arduously cultivating.</p>
<p>Whilst doing this, he would often encounter the former principal. Over time, they built up quite a relationship. The former principal had even invited him over to his place for meals.</p>
<p>Later, the former principal had to retire early due to his ailing physique. Back when he left, Zhou Wen had planned on sending him off, but the former principal refused. He claimed that he hated such scenes the most.</p>
<p>Ever since then, Zhou Wen never met him-it had almost been a year.</p>
<p>“It was he who told me that you’re excellent, far better than Little Jing. Although I’m not fully in agreement with that, you must be excellent since he says so,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What’s your relationship with the former principal?” Zhou Wen looked at Ouyang Lan and asked politely.</p>
<p>“He…” Ouyang Lan blinked craftily before saying, “is my father.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at the photo and back at Ouyang Lan. They did share some resemblances.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to the school’s dormitory, he still found it incredible. The woman his father had married happened to be the former principal’s daughter.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan told him not to worry further. The Special Inspection Bureau wouldn’t find fault with him in the future under the premise that he didn’t leave Luoyang.</p>
<p>She also told Zhou Wen that he could attempt cultivating the Sun Strafe Art that An Jing gave him.</p>
<p>The Sun Strafe Art also came from a mysterious land; however, it had been modified to a simplified version that could be cultivated even without special physiques. In fact, the famous Primordial Energy Arts, like the Invincible Connate Divine Art, all had similar origins.</p>
<p>However, the simplified versions were inferior to the original versions. They lacked the capability of obtaining Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Although the simplified versions were a lot weaker than the original versions, they were still far stronger than the typical Primordial Energy Art. Ouyang Lan hoped that Zhou Wen could master the Sun Strafe Art to increase his chances when he vied for the special physique and Mythical Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Even if he wasn’t concerned about these two factors, cultivating such a high-level Primordial Energy Art only brought benefits.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t make his decision on whether he would be vying for the special physique, but he did plan on taking a look at the Sun Strafe Art.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t wish to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art, but since the Primordial Energy Art came from lands of mystery like the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen wished to know if the Lost Immortal Sutra had any effect on these Primordial Energy Arts.</p>
<p>Having had the USB drive in his possession for so long, this was the first time he was seriously reading the contents. The Sun Strafe Art was indeed a high-level Primordial Energy Art, far greater than Ascetic Meditation.</p>
<p>After reading the entire Sun Strafe Art, nothing happened to the Lost Immortal Sutra in him. It wasn’t like when he had read the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in which the Lost Immortal Sutra would automatically switch to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra’s circulation method.</p>
<p>Could it be that I need to see the original scriptures for it to be of use? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the USB drive and was about to use his phone to grind the Tiger Cage Pass dungeon when Li Xuan came to him.</p>
<p>“The An family has settled the problem for you. The Special Inspection Bureau won’t dare come again. You can rest easy now. Isn’t it about time we complete the test mission Counselor Wang gave us?” Li Xuan said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Alright,” after some thought, Zhou Wen agreed. After all, they didn’t have much time left. It wasn’t a bad idea to complete the test mission now.</p>
<p>Although Wang Fei had said that they could kill the Demonized General in a team of four, Li Xuan and Zhou Wen had no intention of recruiting others. Just the two of them were good enough.</p>
<p>Sunset College was so large that news of yesterday’s ongoings on hadn’t spread to the others. Those who knew Zhou Wen and what had happened were even fewer. Amongst those students, they didn’t react differently when they saw Zhou Wen either.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were walking towards Tiger Cage Pass when they suddenly heard a commotion up ahead. Then, they saw many students running back.</p>
<p>A few of them were running and shouting, “Run! There’s a word-engraved Demonized General ahead. It’s rushing over here.”</p>
<p>As the strategy had specially mentioned that even Legendary stage experts were not necessarily able to defeat word-engraved Demonized Generals, none of the freshmen dared to take risks. All of them fled for the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone’s exit.</p>
<p>“We sure have bad luck. To think that a word-engraved Demonized General would appear. Let’s head back now and wait until the school eliminates it before coming back.” Although Li Xuan was arrogant, he knew where to draw the line.</p>
<h3 id='chapter89'>Chapter 89 Blade Demonized General</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t mind. Word-engraved Demonized Generals were extremely powerful, pinnacle existences among Legendaries. He was only confident of killing Blade Demonized Generals among the word-engraved Demonized Generals. If he were to encounter a Paper Demonized General, death was certain, so there was no need for him to take the risk.</p>
<p>Just as the two were prepared to leave, they saw the stocky Demonized General riding over on a red horse with spear in hand. A few female students were too close to it and were about to be caught up by it.</p>
<p>“Sis!” Li Xuan took a careful look and immediately, the color in his face drained. He summoned the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and rushed over against the escaping crowd.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also saw Li Weiyang among the students being pursued by the Demonized General. However, he did not rush over immediately. He was too far away and couldn’t see clearly what the engraved word on the head was.</p>
<p>If it was Blade, he was confident that he could help Li Xuan rescue Li Weiyang. It was even possible to kill it in passing and he might obtain something good.</p>
<p>However, if they had encountered a Paper Demonized General, Zhou Wen would only be sending himself to his death if he rushed over. It would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang had the Legendary Companion Beasts, Black Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger. Even if they weren’t a match for the Paper Demonized General, they were enough to rescue Li Weiyang by sacrificing them.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Li Xuan your friend? Why aren’t you going to help him?” Zhou Wen was trying to make out the word engraved on the Demonized General’s helmet when he heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>He turned around and saw An Jing standing beside him with a deadpan expression. She had walked over at some point in time.</p>
<p>Her tone had a clear hint of mockery. He glanced at her before ignoring her. He turned his head back to scrutinize the Demonized General’s helmet, trying hard to figure out what the word was.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was quite fond of Ouyang Lan, it did not mean that he had a favorable impression of everyone in the An family. At the very least, he didn’t have a favorable impression of An Jing and An Tianzuo, so he didn’t want to have any interaction with them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wouldn’t vent his anger on Ouyang Lan because of the An siblings, but he wouldn’t extend his fondness to them just because of her.</p>
<p>An Jing didn’t say anything else. She also knew that it was unrealistic for a Mortal stage student to fight a word-engraved Demonized General. It wouldn’t be a heroic act but a suicide.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, An Jing just found Zhou Wen a sore sight. Even if he did the right thing, she just couldn’t help but poke fun at him.</p>
<p>Although she said that, An Jing’s eyes were peeled at the Demonized General. She was prepared to summon her Companion Beast to engage it in combat.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was because An Jing wouldn’t allow her fellow students to be killed by the Demonized General and secondly, the probability of a word-engraved Demonized General’s appearance was very low. Once it appeared, it became the target of the best students in school.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast and Primordial Energy Skill that the word-engraved Demonized General dropped were extremely rare and very useful.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast needed no explanation. It was a Legendary Companion Beast with exceptional strength and could even be of certain use in battles with Epic creatures. It was a top-grade Legendary Companion Beast that was extremely rare.</p>
<p>The word-engraved Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill was also very useful. The Paper Demonized General’s Astral Suction Palm, the Blade Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade, and the Fist Demonized General’s Astral Fist were all rare top-grade Primordial Energy Skills among Legendary ones.</p>
<p>Astral Suction Palm could suck things across space. Astral Slash Blade had a blade beam that was as fast as lightning. Astral Fist’s explosive might was unparalleled. All of them were Primordial Energy Skills that Legendary experts yearned for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were too few word-engraved Demonized Generals. The drop rate of Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skill crystals were just too low. It had been years since the discovery of the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone, but the number of people with word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skills was few in number.</p>
<p>Inside Sunset College, if one could possess a word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beast, or possess a word-engraved Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill, they would be envied by everyone.</p>
<p>It was easy for An Jing to get Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skills, but to obtain a word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beast wasn’t an easy endeavor. There were just too few of them and there was practically none on the market for sale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Companion Beast that dropped from one’s kill gave one a better sense of achievement than buying one.</p>
<p>Just as An Jing was prepared to take action, she saw Zhou Wen suddenly dash forward like a released arrow as he headed straight for the word-engraved Demonized General.</p>
<p>An Jing was taken aback as she hurriedly rushed over.</p>
<p>Although she found Zhou Wen a sore sight, she didn’t wish to see him die here.</p>
<p>She believed that she could easily catch up to him since she was already at the Legendary stage while he was only at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>However, shortly after she chased him, she saw Zhou Wen with four translucent silver wings behind his back. Instantly, his speed was elevated significantly and was in no way inferior to a Legendary. He was even faster and prevented An Jing from catching up to him.</p>
<p>A Legendary Companion Beast? An Jing was puzzled. Zhou Wen was only at the Mortal stage which usually meant the impossibility of incubating a Legendary Companion Beast unless Zhou Wen cultivated in Primordial Energy Arts like the Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>However, An Jing knew him pretty well. She knew that he only cultivated in Ascetic Meditation which made it impossible for him to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she had never seen the Companion Beast he was using. This was quite astonishing to her, considering her background as a member of the illustrious An family.</p>
<p>Even if he has a pinnacle Legendary Companion Beast, it’s impossible to fend against a word-engraved Demonized General. An Jing knew how powerful they were, so she didn’t stop and continued rushing forward.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t plan on overtaking him this time. She wanted to know how strong Zhou Wen currently was. She could take action when he was in danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t think too much. The moment he saw that the Demonized General’s helmet was a Blade, he had rushed forward.</p>
<p>Since he had the ability to help, there was no reason for him to idly stand by. Furthermore, word-engraved Demonized Generals had a low probability of spawning even in-game. Zhou Wen was already hoping to find a Blade Demonized General, so encountering one here was a boon.</p>
<p>Just as Li Xuan had said, he had summoned the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and Black Knight to stop the Demonized General, protecting Li Weiyang and the other girls as they retreated.</p>
<p>The Black Knight rushed right in front of the Demonized General and slammed forward by relying on its heavy armor.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Demonized General’s strange spear thrust out powerfully with roaring flames, stabbing the Black Knight’s helmet right into the breastplate. Half of the Black Knight’s body was slammed into the ground like a wooden column.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Jade-Eyed White Tiger had leaped up, flashing its claws at the Demonized General’s neck. However, before it arrived in front of the Demonized General, the left hand slashed out with a faint, thin blade beam, splitting the Jade-Eyed White Tiger into two.</p>
<p>Li Xuan felt his heart ache. Although Legendary Companion Beasts weren’t much to him, the Jade-Eyed White Tiger was quite a rare Legendary Companion Beast, so finding a second one wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter90'>Chapter 90 Annihilating the General with One Palm</h3>
<p>After killing the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, the Demonized General didn’t cease at all. It raised the strange spear in its hand and the crescent-like side blades swept across the Black Knight’s waist with terrifying flames.</p>
<p>Half of the Black Knight’s body was buried in the ground and it was unable to move at all. If it was struck, it was likely to have its head separated from its body.</p>
<p>“Leave quickly.” Li Xuan didn’t have the luxury of time to moan over his Companion Beasts. The Blade Demonized General was just too fast and powerful. The speed at which it killed the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and Black Knight had far exceeded Li Xuan’s expectations. If they didn’t pull open a distance quickly, it would probably chase after them again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure flew over Li Xuan, arriving above the Demonized General in a blink of an eye. Then, it was split into two.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and was riding on its back, rushing straight for the Demonized General’s head.</p>
<p>The Demonized General waved its left hand, shining out a lightning-like blade beam that moved at an inconceivable speed. The instant it smashed down, the beam had arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its four wings and phased away with silver, dreamy light. Its speed was instantly raised to a terrifying level, allowing it to dodge the Demonized General’s blade beam.</p>
<p>An Jing, who was prepared to take action, was stunned. The Blade Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade was famous for being fast, accurate, and mighty. Yet, that Companion Beast had managed to dodge it. It truly caught her by surprise.</p>
<p>To have a non-avian Companion Beast that has a flight Primordial Energy Skill is rather rare. An Jing stopped in her tracks as she watched the battle.</p>
<p>When the Demonized General missed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant with its blade, the strange spear in its hand swept flames up into the sky, hoping to sweep the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Zhou Wen down.</p>
<p>However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant agilely changed directions in midair, dodging the Demonized General’s strike. At the same time, its stinger shot out Magical Needle at the Demonized General’s head.</p>
<p>However, before it reached the Demonized General, it was cleaved apart by the Astral Slash Blade it sliced out with its left hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as he battled the Demonized General. Using its speed and flight capabilities, and Silver Wing Flash, he dodged all of the Demonized General’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, that Companion Beast is awesome. Where did you get it from? Help me get one in the future.” Li Xuan’s eyes glimmered as he slipped effortlessly into address Zhou Wen affectionately.</p>
<p>To use speed to dodge the Demonized General’s attacks made the Silver-Winged Flying Ant a pinnacle speed-type Companion Beast.</p>
<p>An Jing, Li Weiyang and company also noticed the value of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but An Jing was able to figure out more.</p>
<p>That strange flying ant is a top speed-type Companion Beast at the Legendary stage, but to be able to dodge the Blade Demonized General’s attacks so perfectly isn’t something that can be done with speed alone. Zhou Wen’s control and predictions are all excellent. An Jing didn’t let her hatred for him affect her own judgment. She could tell how formidable Zhou Wen really was.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen fighting the Demonized General, Li Xuan finally seized the opportunity to get the Black Knight to escape from the ground. Just as he was about to order it to help, he saw Zhou Wen jump off from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s back.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, what are you trying to do?” Li Xuan jumped in fright. For the Mortal Zhou Wen to lunge at the Demonized General looked no different from courting death.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang and the other students had their hearts pounding nervously as though they were about to leap out of their chests. Even An Jing’s breathing sped up.</p>
<p>From An Jing’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s actions were too rash. Furthermore, there weren’t any substantial effects.</p>
<p>He was only at the Mortal stage. With Strength at the Mortal stage, even if it was boosted by Primordial Energy Skills, striking a Demonized General’s helmet probably didn’t deal it much damage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore a stoic expression as his body rapidly plummeted. He swung his arm that had been enveloped by the skeleton bracer, striking straight at the top of the Demonized General’s head.</p>
<p>This leap looked like a risky move, but in fact, Zhou Wen had already simulated it hundreds of times in his head. Ever since he had fought the word-engraved Demonized General, he had been thinking of a way to kill them.</p>
<p>The only possibility was to first kill the Blade Demonized General. As for the Paper Demonized General, he temporarily had no means of killing it.</p>
<p>This leap had been calculated by Zhou Wen countless times before he deduced the opportunity.</p>
<p>Back when the Silver-Winged Flying Ant kept flying, it had made the Demonized General run through all its moves. Its Primordial Energy Skills had all been used and it couldn’t immediately use them again. All those powerful moves prevented it from instantly retaliating against Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen leaped down headfirst as his palm struck the Demonized General’s helmet.</p>
<p>If it were only an ordinary Mortal Primordial Energy Skill, it wouldn’t be able to tear through the helmet’s defense with the skeleton bracer’s augmentation.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm at Rank 10 was different. This was a palm with a cold, explosive might. It could generate a penetrative effect at short distances.</p>
<p>Although this palm looked like it had smacked the helmet, its force had already penetrated into the Demonized General’s head, striking its brains.</p>
<p>With the success of the attack, Zhou Wen pressed down on the Demonized General’s helmet and used the reactionary force to retreat several meters. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was already waiting there for him as he somersaulted and landed on its back, his eyes staring intently at the Demonized General.</p>
<p>As he had never attempted it in-game, he wasn’t sure of the effects of this palm strike.</p>
<p>An Jing, Li Xuan, and the other students were also staring at the Demonized General. They felt that the palm didn’t seem to have much of an effect as there wasn’t any mark on its helmet.</p>
<p>But the next second, the Demonized General looked up and spewed a mouthful of blood before collapsing from its horse. The red horse neighed as it exploded, scattering its flesh and blood everywhere.</p>
<p>He had managed to slay a word-engraved Demonized General! When An Jing saw the horse explode, she knew that the Demonized General was definitely dead.</p>
<p>Li Xuan yelled, “Did anyone do a recording? Did anyone record that battle? How long did he take?”</p>
<p>The school’s test missions required video proof. Although he didn’t know how long Zhou Wen had taken, it didn’t feel like he took more than ninety seconds.</p>
<p>“I did,” a girl beside Li Weiyang said meekly.</p>
<p>The few of them had come to complete a test mission, so they had a video recording the entire time. They had also recorded the battle that had just finished.</p>
<p>Li Weiyang got the girl to play the recording as they looked over. He had taken 79 seconds.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you took 79 seconds to kill a word-engraved Demonized General. You are really awesome!” Li Xuan yelled at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in no mood to care about the numbers. He ran straight to the dead Demonized General, hoping to find a dimensional crystal or Companion Egg from its corpse.</p>
<p>Pulling apart the Demonized General’s helmet, he saw red and white fluids flow out. Amidst that was a resplendent object.</p>
<h3 id='chapter91'>Chapter 91 Astral Slash Blade Beam</h3>
<p>Li Xuan and company noticed the egg-sized crystal that Zhou Wen pulled out.</p>
<p>The crystal looked dreamy with a glow flickering within it. The glow had the appearance of the Demonized General, making it a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>“The Blade Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill. I wonder which one is it. He’s really struck it rich if it’s Astral Slash Blade,” Li Xuan said as he approached to take a look at the crystal.</p>
<p>As the Blade Demonized General had several Primordial Energy Skills, with Astral Slash Blade being one of them, the chances of it dropping were extremely low even if a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal were to drop.</p>
<p>By the side, An Jing suddenly said, “The Demonized General figure inside the crystal has a faint red glow on the word engraved on top of its head. This Primordial Energy Skill Crystal is Astral Slash Blade.”</p>
<p>“It’s really Astral Slash Blade! Old Zhou, your luck is really unparalleled!” Li Xuan said in excitement, “If you wish to sell this Astral Slash Blade skill, just sell it to me. I’ll quickly advance to the Legendary stage, so I’ll be able to use it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head slightly and placed the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal in his pocket.</p>
<p>The average person couldn’t withstand the surge of Primordial Energy Skills at the Mortal stage. Any forceful absorption would damage the body, and in serious cases, might even lead to death.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. If he could take the Primordial Energy Skill into the game and let the blood-colored avatar attempt to absorb it, he himself wouldn’t be in any danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already tried absorbing Legendary Primordial Energy Skills in-game and all of them had happened without a hitch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s news of killing the word-engraved Demonized General quickly spread across campus. To kill one in 79 seconds was unheard of even amongst special admissions students.</p>
<p>However, the topic of conversation was the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Many people believed that it was due to it that Zhou Wen was able to slay the word-engraved Demonized General. Such Speed and ability of flight made it a top Speed-type, flight-capable Companion Beast among those at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>After Wang Fei saw the recording of Zhou Wen slaying the word-engraved Demonized General, she gave Zhou Wen a very high evaluation, believing him to be a talent worth nurturing</p>
<p>Even An Jing, who always found him a sore sight, viewed him in a different light. She believed that Zhou Wen would once again get back on his feet, turning back into the genius he once was.</p>
<p>However, Wang Fei and An Jing quickly realized they were wrong. After killing the word-engraved Demonized General, Zone didn’t come out of his dorm at all. He didn’t enter the dimensional zones to train himself, nor did he attend any classes.</p>
<p>An Jing often saw Zhou Wen lying in the yard, holding his phone gaming while sunbathing. He gamed for several hours at a time without even changing his pose.</p>
<p>After he obtained the Astral Slash Blade Primordial Energy Skill, many students tried to buy it from him through different means, but they were all rejected by him.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen already had the ability to kill Blade Demonized Generals and could always slowly grind one in-game, that would take him too much time. He didn’t wish to waste any time for just some pittance of money.</p>
<p>On the day he returned home with the Astral Slash Blade Crystal, he had tried using the mysterious phone to snap a picture of it. It instantly pulled it in-game and allowed him to successfully master the Astral Slash Blade Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>What left Zhou Wen perplexed was that Astral Slash Blade was somewhat different from the typical Primordial Energy Skill. This was because it didn’t have a rank and the amount of Primordial Energy it expended wasn’t fixed.</p>
<p>Either 1 or 10 points of Primordial Energy was enough to release Astral Slash Blade, but the unleashed force was different. The more Primordial Energy used, the stronger the Astral Slash Blade’s beam was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had tested the might of the Astral Slash Blade in-game. When using 10 points of Primordial Energy, it could instantly cull the Legendary Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair. It was fast and ruthless, giving him the exhilaration of killing someone through empty space. It was something Ashen Palm and Vigor Divine Fist couldn’t compete with.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, Zhou Wen had been grinding Tiger Cage Pass in a bid to encounter Paper Demonized Generals. He wanted to see if Astral Slash Blade could crack the Primordial Energy Skill of the Paper Demonized General.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his luck was terrible. After repeatedly grinding Tiger Cage Pass, he only encountered one word-engraved Demonized General. It wasn’t a Blade Demonized General, but a Fist Demonized General.</p>
<p>When Astral Slash Blade and Zhou Wen’s other Primordial Energy Skills hit the Fist Demonized General, its body would flash a golden light as though it was layered in gold. Even the Astral Slash Blade’s beam couldn’t leave a scratch.</p>
<p>Finally, the blood-colored avatar was slain by the Fist Demonized General with one charge, leaving him rather disheartened.</p>
<p>However, he was used to such outcomes. Compared to others being capable of encountering one word-engraved Demonized General in a timespan of two to three months, his efficiency was considered a lot higher.</p>
<p>Just as he was preparing to continue grinding Tiger Cage Pass, he heard his phone ring. He still picked it up despite it being an unknown number.</p>
<p>“Is this Zhou Wen? You have a delivery.” A man’s voice sounded from the phone.</p>
<p>I don’t think I bought anything on the Internet recently. Who would deliver something to me? Zhou Wen thought for a while to no avail. However, he went to the door to take receipt of the parcel.</p>
<p>The parcel wasn’t very big. Zhou Wen looked at it carefully and saw that the sender had the word “principal” written on it.</p>
<p>The former principal mailed me something? Zhou Wen found that the most probably.</p>
<p>Previously, Ouyang Lan had mentioned to him that the former principal had been invited to a mysterious dimensional zone and hadn’t returned to date. That was because the magnetic fields there were abnormal, preventing any communication devices to be used. Even Ouyang Lan didn’t know his present situation.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen opened the parcel and couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw the thing inside.</p>
<p>The parcel wasn’t big to begin with. Stuffed inside it were several old newspapers, but the only thing of note was a name card.</p>
<p>It was a real name card. The owner of the name card was the owner of a dimensional crystal shop. His name was Qin Xiyuan. On the back of the name card was the address and contact number of the shop.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was a string of numbers that were handwritten at the bottom. It was just underneath the telephone number, so it looked like an additional number to call.</p>
<p>Is this name card really from the former principal? Zhou Wen felt puzzled, unsure why he would mail this to him.</p>
<p>He picked up the delivery notice and tried calling the sender’s number, but he only received the notification: “The number you called is not in service.”</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. He took a look at the sender’s address and saw that it was a place in the East District named Zhuolu County. There wasn’t an exact street or unit number.</p>
<h3 id='chapter92'>Chapter 92 Excellent-Grade Companion Egg</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen studied it for quite some time before figuring out what the name card meant. On it was a string of handwritten numbers that didn’t seem like a telephone number.</p>
<p>Typical cell phone numbers were 11 digits with landlines being 7. However, this number had 10 digits, so it clearly wasn’t right.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem right either that certain digits of a cell phone number were missing. This was because the string of numbers started with a 5 while cell phone numbers typically started with 1. Most people usually wouldn’t write the first digit wrongly.</p>
<p>What does this string of numbers represent? Zhou Wen had the urge to ask the former principal if it was from him, but he didn’t have his contact details.</p>
<p>Although he could return to the An family to ask Ouyang Lan, he didn’t wish to have too much interaction with them, nor did he wish to head to the An family home again.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan was nice, but Zhou Wen wasn’t fond of the An siblings, much less wish to have much to do with them.</p>
<p>After some thought, he put away the name card. If this item had really been mailed to him by the former principal, it was likely that he would contact him in the future.</p>
<p>After packing up, Zhou Wen continued gaming</p>
<p>Wang Fei’s mood was terrible. Her opinion was that Zhou Wen was a genius. For him to slay the Blade Demonized General single-handedly, that level of combat skill was enough to shock Sunset College even if one didn’t consider his cultivation talent.</p>
<p>Wang Fei believed that if he was properly nurtured, his future was limitless. Furthermore, Ouyang Lan had also requested her to take good care of him.</p>
<p>No matter how good his talent is, it will all go to waste if he keeps gaming. I have to place him back on the right track. Wang Fei believed that she was obligated and responsible for teaching Zhou Wen well.</p>
<p>Even without Ouyang Lan, she didn’t wish a genius like Zhou Wen to let his talent go to waste.</p>
<p>How can I get Zhou Wen to quit gaming and reestablish his values towards life and the world? Wang Fei frowned in thought.</p>
<p>The harm games brought about was a serious societal issue before the dimensional storms. Countless parents and teachers did their best to stop students from being obsessed with gaming, but this problem wasn’t solved at its roots.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, due to the change in society and the collective consciousness, the number of students who gamed had reduced significantly. However, there were still many who were obsessed with gaming.</p>
<p>Wang Fei felt that Zhou Wen mustn’t have fallen too deep. After all, he had been a diligent student in the past. He was only using games to escape reality after suffering a heavy setback.</p>
<p>However, from the two battles Zhou Wen engaged in after coming to Sunset College, his foundation was excellent. He had to be a very diligent and assiduous student. As long as his confidence and values towards life were established again, he could quit his gaming addiction.</p>
<p>After some thought, Wang Fei’s eyes suddenly lit up. He that hides can find. Since Zhou Wen lost his confidence and is escaping from reality after his defeat by An Jing, wouldn’t defeating An Jing allow him to reestablish his confidence?</p>
<p>The more Wang Fei thought about it, the more viable she found it to be. To get Zhou Wen to defeat a genius like An Jing was also a challenge and accomplishment for a teacher. This would only make it more interesting.</p>
<p>Wang Fei steeled her resolve to complete this plan of hers. She wished that a student she mentored could defeat An Jing who the An family treated like a treasure. Even her body heated up in excitement.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know that he had become a gaming addict youth in Wang Fei’s eyes. He had even become a target for receiving plenty of help. At this moment, he was still focusing on grinding</p>
<p>Having lost count of the number of times he grinded Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen finally encountered a word-engraved Demonized General. From a distance, Zhou Wen was delighted because engraving on the Demonized General’s helmet was “Paper.”</p>
<p>He sent the blood-colored avatar charging at the Demonized General for he was already very familiar with its series of attacks. With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Speed, it wasn’t difficult for him to deal with it.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar dodged the strange spear’s first strike, the Paper Demonized General used its Astral Suction Palm. It widened its left palm and aimed it at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar seemed to be bound by a potent, invisible force and was yanked towards the Paper Demonized General.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, the blood-colored avatar’s left palm exploded a faint beam that resembled a blade. It instantly sliced through the invisible force beyond his body.</p>
<p>The Astral Suction Palm’s strength was like a piece of paper that was sliced through by the sharp blade beam. The thin silk-like blade beam then cleaved into the gap between the Paper Demonized General’s helmet and breastplate, beheading it with one strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. Although he guessed that Astral Slash Blade could counter the Paper Demonized General’s Primordial Energy Skill, he never expected it to be this strong. He had expended 10 points of Primordial Energy for the Astral Slash Blade, and it ended up beheading the Paper Demonized General.</p>
<p>‘Killed Mutated Demonized General. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>However, what left Zhou Wen depressed was that the Paper Demonized General didn’t drop a Primordial Energy Skill or Companion Egg. All it dropped was a Strength Crystal valued at 18.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had advanced to the Legendary stage, such a Strength Crystal was naturally the best. He would instantly have his Strength stat rise to 18. Unfortunately, he was still at the Mortal stage and his Strength’s limit couldn’t be broken. Having such a high-valued Strength Crystal was useless.</p>
<p>Rushing in the direction of Tiger Cage Pass, he was shot to death once again. It was equivalent to him committing suicide but he had no way of having the dungeon respawn its monsters without him dying.</p>
<p>When he entered the game again, Zhou Wen killed the Skeleton General, Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once more.</p>
<p>As the chances of a drop were too low, Zhou Wen’s repeated grinding didn’t reward him with anything good. However, with a massive number of grinding instances, anything with a low probability would eventually drop.</p>
<p>This time, after killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, a Companion Egg dropped. When Zhou Wen saw its stats, his eyes lit up. He nearly kissed the Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear Lotus</p>
<p>Strength: 18</p>
<p>Speed: 15</p>
<p>Constitution: 17</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Blood-Patterned Buddha Aspect, Lotus Bullets, Venom Toad, Buddha Lotus Rage.</p>
<p>A Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus with four talent skills. Its Strength and Primordial Energy are considered at max level. Even for a flower-type Companion Beast with weak Constitution, it’s at 17. This Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus is an excellent one! Zhou Wen drooled as he looked at the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg.</p>
<p>But in an instant, Zhou Wen felt vexed. He couldn’t bear to feed such an excellent-grade Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to Truth Listener and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.</p>
<p>However, if he were to incubate it, his lacking Primordial Energy might create new problems.</p>
<p>I can only risk it. Zhou Wen saw that the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s fusion success rate and decided to fuse them together.</p>
<h3 id='chapter93'>Chapter 93 Lotus Ant</h3>
<p>The game system gave a compatibility score of 34%. This also meant that the chance of a successful fusion was at about a third. It was quite a low probability.</p>
<p>However, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was so excellent that Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to feed it to Truth Listener. He had no way of taking it out of the game after all.</p>
<p>As for the Mutated Skeleton Ant, although it was quite a good Mortal Companion Beast, it was limited by its Mortal stage. After having the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, there was a decreasing need for it. Even if he didn’t fuse it now, it would gradually be eliminated in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, after plenty of thought, he decided to risk it to fuse the two Companion Beasts together.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen chose to proceed with the fusion of the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, the game system immediately gave a notification: ‘As the Mutated Skeleton Ant is an adult, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus will be treated as a supplement for fusion. Proceed with fusion?’</p>
<p>It was identical to the previous time. Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared, so he instantly chose ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg and Mutated Skeleton Ant bloomed with light as the former flew to the latter. As the two blobs of light merged into one, it caused the entire phone screen to light up. Instantly, nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for quite some time until the phone’s screen dimmed. Then, he heard a chime.</p>
<p>‘Fusion successful. Obtained Legendary Companion Beast, Mutated Lotus Flower Ant.’</p>
<p>Only then could Zhou Wen see a Companion Beast on his screen. It didn’t look much different from the Mutated Skeleton Ant from before. It still had a white bone exterior and its body seemed to be bigger. On its head, there was a budding blood-colored lotus flower.</p>
<p>After opening the stats of the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, Zhou Wen was overjoyed by what he saw.</p>
<p>Mutated Lotus Flower Ant: Legendary</p>
<p>Legendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear Lotus</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 17</p>
<p>Constitution: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 18</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Skeleton Pierce (Rank 10), Blood-Patterned Buddha Aspect (Rank 9), Lotus Bullets (Rank 5), Venom Toad (rank 8), Buddha Lotus Rage (Rank 9).</p>
<p>Companion Form: Bracer.</p>
<p>The Lotus Ant had inherited the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s Life Providence-Turbid Waters Clear Lotus. It was a pretty good and pragmatic one that made it immune to venomous liquids and corrosion.</p>
<p>Amongst the four stats, only Speed was 1 point short of maxing out. As for Strength, it was an Overdrive at 19, having exceeded the limits of a typical Legendary maximum. It was considered the best among the best.</p>
<p>Even crazier was that the Lotus Ant had retained all the Mutated Skeleton Ant’s and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s skills, becoming one with five Primordial Energy Skills. Furthermore, it was a terrifying existence with rather high Primordial Energy Skill ranks.</p>
<p>If such a Legendary Companion Beast was put on sale, just the fact that it had five Primordial Energy Skills was enough for it to be sold at an astronomical price. If there was an overall Legendary Companion Beast ranking, the Mutated Lotus Ant would definitely rank high.</p>
<p>In his joy, Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Lotus Ant and saw a horrifying tank-sized ant appear in front of him. Its body was covered in terrifying bone spikes that made it look ferocious and terrifying.</p>
<p>But on its head was a red lotus flower. It was connected to the top of its head with a flower bud. It made its terrifying looks appear rather adorable.</p>
<p>As the Mutated Lotus Ant crawled, the lotus flower on its head would bob up and down, making it rather interesting.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was admiring the Mutated Lotus Ant, he suddenly heard the doorbell ring. After dispelling the summon, he opened the door and was astonished to see Wang Fei.</p>
<p>Sunset College’s education methods were very simple. One counselor led a class and was responsible for giving class homework and missions. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t be directly involved in the education of students.</p>
<p>Students could select which teacher’s classes they attended based on the mission they had. They could then learn the knowledge and techniques they needed.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Wang Fei was Zhou Wen’s counselor, there weren’t many opportunities for him to meet her. She typically wouldn’t request a meeting with her students before the ten-day deadline of the last mission.</p>
<p>Unless a student encountered problems and sought her help, a counselor typically didn’t interfere with a student’s usual studies.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, pack your things. Let’s have a walk,” Wang Fei said directly before he could even speak.</p>
<p>“Miss Wang, what do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked, feeling somewhat unhappily.</p>
<p>Wang Fei said with a smile, “Professor Chen has a project that requires a student to be his assistant. I think you are very suitable for it, so I recommended you to him.”</p>
<p>“Is that a homework mission?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had no intention of being an assistant.</p>
<p>He had long heard of the benefits that came from being a professor’s assistant as it allowed one to interact with many high-level objects and broaden one’s horizons while also gaining some pointers from a professor. It was an opportunity many students wanted.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t like having such an opportunity. Although it was beneficial, it required him to sacrifice his time to work for the professor.</p>
<p>To other students, such work was a way of honing themselves, a type of improvement. But to Zhou Wen, it was a waste of time that would eat into his gaming time.</p>
<p>“It’s not a homework mission. I just find you very suited for it, so I recommended you. Professor Chen has great achievements when it comes to nurturing Companion Beasts. In Sunset College, he’s an authority in such matters. Furthermore, he has done a great amount of research on melee-fighting Primordial Energy Skills. I believe it will be very beneficial to you if you were to learn from him.” Wang Fei was feeling rather pleased with herself.</p>
<p>Professor Chen was a famous old fogey. Getting anyone to convince him to take in another student as an assistant was practically impossible. In Sunset College, not more than three people could get Professor Chen to agree to such a request.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t able to see Wang Fei’s face as he said directly, “Miss Wang, if it’s not a homework mission, I hope to decline the offer.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei’s smile instantly froze. Imagining that Zhou Wen wasn’t aware of what was happening, she explained, “Professor Chen Qishan isn’t just an authoritative figure in Sunset College, but in the entire League. By being his assistant, you can come into contact with several high-level Companion Beasts and learn of their characteristics and powers. This will be of tremendous help to your future exploring of dimensional zones. Furthermore, Professor Chen is…”</p>
<p>Before Wang Fei could finish, Zhou Wen said firmly, “Miss Wang, thank you for your kind intentions. I still wish to decline. My usual homework missions give me enough stress. I need time for studying and revision. I really do not have enough time, so if it isn’t a homework mission, I wish to decline.”</p>
<p>Wang Fei felt as if she had been doused in cold water. All her excitement and glee instantly turned to nothing. It left her mood extremely nasty.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you are declining?” Wang Fei asked Zhou Wen with a glare.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Wang.” Zhou Wen clearly wasn’t good at reading people as he nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Wang Fei turned and left, her teeth grinding angrily.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s counselor, one who had paid special attention to him, Wang Fei knew that he hadn’t attended any teacher classes for the past few days, so what did he mean by studying and revision? Apart from slaying the Blade Demonized General, he likely spent most of his days in his dorm gaming.</p>
<h3 id='chapter94'>Chapter 94 Unwinding Monument</h3>
<p>Wang Fei clearly didn’t plan on giving up just like that. Regardless of her being a counselor or Ouyang Lan’s good friend, she believed that she had the obligation to rescue Zhou Wen who was a gaming addict who had excellent talent.</p>
<p>Since you have no intention of improving yourself, I’ll make you realize the importance with the help of external forces. Wang Fei’s eyes darted about as she came up with an idea.</p>
<p>However, her idea couldn’t be carried out immediately. She needed to wait for the Demonized General slaying mission to end before she could use a new homework mission and force Zhou Wen to face the difficulty.</p>
<p>In the next homework mission, it appears I need to get that little fellow to make a trip to Jingshi Mountain. Wang Fei’s eyes flickered with excitement.</p>
<p>Jingshi Mountain was also known as Mount Laojun. It was the main peak in the of the Funiu Mountain Range that spanned 400 kilometers. Legend had it that this was the place the founder of Daoism, Li Er, had hidden himself. Although the legend’s veracity couldn’t be confirmed, Mount Laojun also became a dimensional storms zone after the dimensional storms. Furthermore, it became rather strange.</p>
<p>The other dimensional zones were fraught with danger with dimensional creatures extremely ferocious. However, Mount Laojun’s dimensional creatures wouldn’t attack humans without reason. They almost never injured anyone.</p>
<p>Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak had many Daoist temples, but to date, no one had been able to conquer the Golden Peak.</p>
<p>Beneath the Golden Peak was a Wordless Monument. Although there were no words engraved on it, whoever viewed it would feel inspired and refreshed. They wouldn’t be frustrated by trivialities of the human world. Therefore, the Wordless Monument was named Unwinding Monument.</p>
<p>However, looking at Unwinding Monument for a while was good, but if one looked at it for too long, one’s mind would be so stimulated that not only couldn’t they sleep, they would even be in a hyperactive state, as though they had infinite energy and were eager to do something.</p>
<p>Some people who looked at Unwinding Monument for too long would begin boxing with all their might for three full days. Others would begin running until they were exhausted and unable to crawl.</p>
<p>In short, as long as one looked at the Unwinding Monument, they would become extremely inspired and diligent no matter how lazy they were.</p>
<p>The amount of time one looked at Unwinding Monument had to be controlled. If one were to stare at it for too long, they might die from overstimulation. It was something that had happened before.</p>
<p>Although Mount Laojun was in Luoyang, it wasn’t inside Sunset College. Therefore, Wang Fei planned on leading the class to Mount Laojun after the Demonized General homework mission was over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued grinding in his form, but he wasn’t just mindlessly grinding.</p>
<p>He had planned on rushing into Ant City, Fire God Platform, and Tiger Cage Pass to see if there were any places similar to Small Buddha Temple. Unfortunately, he met with repeated failures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a suspicion that the reason the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t advance him to Legendary had to do with his mastery of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>Due to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen’s stat had broken through to 11 points while the other stats remained at 10.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen believed that the Lost Immortal Sutra allowed him to master other Primordial Energy Arts and they also could perhaps raise his other stats to 11.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if the Lost Immortal Sutra had such a feature, nor did he know if he could advance to the Legendary stage when all his stats reached 11. However, it brought him some hope, far better than not having any clue at all.</p>
<p>It was a pity that Zhou Wen didn’t find any places similar to Small Buddha Temple. There was a monument above the Fire God Platform, but there were firebirds protecting it, preventing him from rushing up and seeing what the monument with the word “Imperial” engraved on it was.</p>
<p>Truth Listener is said to be a Mythical Companion Beast, so all its beginning stats are at 11. Perhaps the value 11 has some specialness. Zhou Wen thought about rushing to the Fire God Platform again, but before he could rush to its peak, he died under the ever-increasing horde of firebirds.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I need to obtain a Primordial Energy Art that imbues alacrity. It’s impossible to reach the top of Fire God Platform by simply relying on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Zhou Wen switched off the phone and began researching on the school’s website.</p>
<p>Currently, his phone had Ant Nest, Ancient Imperial City, Underground Buddha City, and Tiger Cage Pass. None of these dungeons produced Primordial Energy Skills that imbued alacrity. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to find new dungeons.</p>
<p>The school’s data was very comprehensive. When he searched for Primordial Energy Skills that imbued alacrity, he quickly found an answer.</p>
<p>Sunset College had many dimensional zones that produced such skills. And the most famous one was at Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>There were two from Dragon Gate Grotto. One of them was the Mount Dragon Gate’s Fish Dragon Transformation while the other was the Dragon Gate Grotto’s Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>Mount Dragon Gate’s Fish Dragon Transformation stemmed from the legend of carps jumping through a dragon gate to transform into a dragon. It was a Primordial Energy Skill that allowed one to soar straight up to a height of hundreds of feet as though one was flying in the sky.</p>
<p>However, a single leap of Fish Dragon Transformation was enough to drain all of one’s Primordial Energy. Such massive expenditure wasn’t one that Zhou Wen needed. Furthermore, Mount Dragon Gate wasn’t in Sunset College.</p>
<p>Dragon Gate Fairy Skill was the complete opposite of Fish Dragon Transformation. It was a long-lasting Primordial Energy Skill that imbued alacrity. It used one’s changes in motion to fly and dance in the sky like a fairy. Although it needed a point to leverage upon, making it not true flight, it was good enough.</p>
<p>However, obtaining the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill wasn’t simple. This was only produced by the Lotus Flower Cave in Dragon Gate Grotto. Furthermore, the drop rate was very low. People could spend more than a year inside without having it drop.</p>
<p>Firstly, Dragon Gate Fairy Skill’s drop rate was very low and secondly, there were very few dimensional creatures in Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms about that. All he needed to do was head to Dragon Gate Grotto and download the dungeon before being able to grind it infinitely. He didn’t need to worry about not having dimensional creatures to clear.</p>
<p>Of course, that was on the premise that he had enough blood to support such an action.</p>
<p>Thinking of how great his recent blood loss was, he drank a mouthful of his self-brewed blood replenishing tea. Although it didn’t seem to be of any use, it gave him a placebo effect.</p>
<p>He was about to head to Dragon Gate Grotto and see if he could download it, but to his surprise, just as he left his building, he saw the young white-gloved military officer standing at his yard’s entrance, instructing two soldiers to carry a crate in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized the young military officer. He was An Tianzuo’s adjutant and driver who he had met before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know why he was here. Just as he was about to ask, the adjutant said, “Young Master Wen, Madam has requested me to bring this crate to you. Please acknowledge receipt.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly and walked over to the crate and opened it up a little. Immediately, he saw all kinds of dazzling dimensional crystals inside.</p>
<h3 id='chapter95'>Chapter 95 Dragon Gate Grotto</h3>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, this is your allowance for this month. If it’s not enough, you can always request more from Madam. She had actually planned on preparing a few Companion Beasts that would be suitable for you, but after recognizing the fact that you would be advancing to the Legendary stage soon, they weren’t made. There will be more choices and useful ones when the time comes,” the adjutant said.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan really gave this to me?” Zhou Wen asked the adjutant.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the adjutant answered with great certainty.</p>
<p>“Then help me thank Sis Lan. I appreciate the gesture, but I don’t need it,” Zhou Wen said as he lowered the lid.</p>
<p>The adjutant looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. “Young Master Wen, this is your allowance, just like Miss Jing. It’s what you deserve.”</p>
<p>“That’s what An Jing deserves, not me. I have no need for it either. Please return and tell Sis Lan. I respect her, but my surname isn’t An,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The adjutant looked at Zhou Wen but stopped trying to persuade him. He just took out a pen and paper to write down a cell phone number and handed it to him with both hands. “Young Master Wen, I’ll take the items back. This is my number where I’m contactable any time of the day. If you have any requests, feel free to give me a call.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Thank you.” Zhou Wen took the paper slip and saw the number. There were the words “Ah Sheng” written behind the number, perhaps the name of the adjutant.</p>
<p>However, the name looked more like a nickname or pet name. It didn’t seem like a real name.</p>
<p>As though he noticed Zhou Wen’s doubts, Ah Sheng said, “I was picked up by Overseer An in a dimensional zone. I had suffered serious injuries to my head and lost all my memories. Overseer An hopes that I can be reborn from the flames, which is why he gave me the name “sheng” representing life. I also took on his surname as An. Young Master Wen, you can just call me Ah Sheng.”</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you Ah Sheng. Please help me take the things back.” Zhou Wen put away the paper slip and after sending Adjutant Ah Sheng off, he headed straight for Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng returned to the An family with the items; however, he didn’t take them to Ouyang Lan but to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring the items back?” An Tianzuo looked at the crate with a frown.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen wanted me to bring them back,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Did you tell him that they were from my mom?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Master Wen said to thank her. He appreciates her gesture, but he doesn’t want the items,” Ah Sheng replied truthfully.</p>
<p>“Then put them away,” An Tianzuo said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Overseer, I think Young Master Wen must have guessed that these things weren’t from Madam,” Ah Sheng added.</p>
<p>“Why so?” An Tianzuo asked with piqued interest.</p>
<p>“Just a feeling without any basis.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t a woman, so what feeling is there to speak off.” An Tianzuo paused and said, “This Zhou Wen has quite a backbone. However, one cannot be successful with backbone alone. If he wishes to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art, it’s a mystery how long it will take for him to advance to the Legendary stage without enough Primordial Energy Crystals. We can’t have Little Jing waiting for him all the time, right?”</p>
<p>“Overseer, I have something I’m not sure if I should say,” Ah Sheng said with some hesitation.</p>
<p>“Cut it out. When have you held back?” An Tianzuo said with a grunt.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng said, “Miss Jing’s body isn’t good, so Madam preventing her vying for the special physique is for her own good, but why must she compete with Young Master Wen for supremacy?”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said lightly, “I know Little Jing’s personality all too well. She doesn’t care about the nomination, but she wants to prove to Mom that Zhou Wen isn’t as excellent as Grandfather claims him to be, and definitely not better than she is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed the navigation and headed for Dragon Gate Grotto.</p>
<p>As Dragon Gate Grotto was just too huge, Sunset College actually covered a tiny area of it. Most of it was outside the campus.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen arrived, he realized a serious problem.</p>
<p>Places like Ancient Imperial City, Underground Buddha City, and Tiger Cage Pass had a small palm symbol that allowed him to see it at a glance, thereby successfully scanning it and downloading the dungeon.</p>
<p>However, Dragon Gate Grotto was a kilometer-long stretch. There were countless stone monuments and stone sculptures here, but there was nothing that resembled an entrance like a city gate. There was no obvious spot to find the small palm symbol.</p>
<p>There were many caves that could be entered in Dragon Gate Grotto. The dimensional zones inside formed an infinitely extensive area. For instance, the Lotus Flower Cave which Zhou Wen wanted to go to was just one of many.</p>
<p>Without the palm symbol, Zhou Wen could only follow the river, carefully taking in everything around him—the Buddha statues and stone sculptures. He hoped to find the palm symbol and download the dungeon into his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gate Grotto had about a hundred thousand Buddha statues. The tallest one reached nearly twenty meters and there were more than fifty caves. The masonry numbered thousands. After the dimensional storms, every cave had a huge number of dimensional creatures appearing in their interior.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around as he walked, making extremely slow progress. However, he didn’t find the palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen?” As he was searching for the symbol along the river, he suddenly heard someone call his name.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned and realized that the person who called out to him was the girl, Wang Lu, who lived next door to him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, have you come to Dragon Gate Grotto for cultivation as well?” Wang Lu asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m just here to take a look. I don’t plan on entering,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Since you’re here, it’s a shame if you don’t go in. I heard there have recently been dragon roars inside Old Dragon Cave. There’s also a treasure-like glow that appears at night. It’s very strange. Why don’t you go in with me to take a look?” Wang Lu invited.</p>
<p>“The stranger it is, the more dangerous it is. It’s better I do not enter,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking ahead.</p>
<p>Wang Lu stuck her tongue out and headed for Old Dragon Cave.</p>
<p>Dragon Gate Grotto was just too huge and there were too many carvings. To find a small palm symbol clearly wasn’t an easy task. Zhou Wen was very patient, but despite scouring every inch, he ultimately failed to find the tiny symbol.</p>
<p>Could it be that not all dimensional zones can be downloaded? Zhou Wen began having doubts, but he continued searching.</p>
<p>Outside Dragon Gate Grotto was a rather popular place as many Sunset College students came here for cultivation and to kill dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>There were some people from Luoyang who weren’t students who entered via the north entrance. He also saw many people setting up shop by the caves, some selling the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that came from the respective cave.</p>
<p>Upon seeing those stalls selling Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen suddenly had a thought. The mysterious phone can download a Companion Egg into the game via taking a picture. Then, can I take the Companion Eggs of others in-game by snapping a photo? The phone shouldn’t be smart enough to tell who the Companion Egg belongs to, right?</p>
<h3 id='chapter96'>Chapter 96 Rock Qilin Companion Egg</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t the kind of person who would rob for no good reason. Although he thought of doing so, he didn’t actually do it.</p>
<p>However, he still used the phone’s camera app to aim it at a Companion Egg placed on a stall but he didn’t press the shutter button.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t snap the photo, the phone’s screen still showed the Companion Egg’s stats.</p>
<p>Stone Warrior: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Stone Contract</p>
<p>Strength: 16</p>
<p>Speed: 13</p>
<p>Constitution: 16</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 12</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Stone Blast Punch</p>
<p>It was a Legendary Companion Egg with very ordinary stats and nothing outstanding. However, the mysterious phone’s feature delighted Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Dimensional crystals did not have numbers in real life, but technological methods could be used to roughly measure their power. This allowed them to roughly tell the level of dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>However, Companion Eggs could not be measured at all because the same type of Companion Eggs gave almost the same figures even when measured using a device. To get a Companion Beast with excellent stats depended on luck.</p>
<p>With the mysterious phone’s feature, he could directly see the Companion Egg’s stats. That way, he didn’t need to count on his luck and directly choose a Companion Egg with excellent stats for incubation.</p>
<p>The Companion Eggs sold at Dragon Gate Grotto were basically at the Legendary stage and were few in variety. Most stalls only sold two types.</p>
<p>One of them was a Stone Warrior and the other was Stone Qilin. Other than those, it was rare to see other types.</p>
<p>“Boss, are there any other Companion Eggs besides the Stone Warriors and Stone Qilin?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>The boss shook his head impatiently and said, “No, Dragon Gate Grotto produces plenty of these. The other Companion Eggs have an extremely low chance of dropping. They are almost unobtainable. Even if someone obtains one, they won’t sell it cheaply.”</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could ask further, he heard someone beside him say, “The Stone Warriors and Stone Qilins are the most common dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. The probability of them dropping Companion Eggs is also very high. In Luoyang, those at the Legendary stage will have two Companion Beasts but don’t think little of them just because they are common. In fact, excellent-grade Stone Warriors and Stone Qilins are rather powerful and useful Legendary Companion Beasts.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his head and realized that the person who spoke was Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Wang Lu continued, “An excellent-grade Stone Warrior is top amongst its peers in terms of Strength and Constitution. They are just a tad slower. However, the might of its Stone Blast Punch is very powerful. It’s a Companion Beast with extremely strong offensive ability. A Stone Qilin is even stronger. A typical Stone Qilin has a Primordial Energy Skill that can harden one’s skin by turning it to stone, but if one can obtain a Stone Qilin that has Qilin Dominance Body, they will be a powerful existence among the top-ranking Legendary Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After Wang Lu said that, the stall owner gave her a thumbs up and said, “This young lady is an expert. She even knows about Qilin Dominance Body. That’s right, Stone Qilin with Qilin Dominance Body are indeed excellent among Legendaries, but despite the numerous Stone Qilin Companion Eggs, the number with Qilin Dominance Body are one in a thousand. They are just too rare.”</p>
<p>With that said, the boss chuckled and pointed at a stone egg on his stall’s counter. “I only have one Stone Qilin Companion Egg. Lady, do you want to try your luck?”</p>
<p>Wang Lu smiled and shook his head. “Although Stone Qilins are strong, they don’t look very cute. It’s not the type I’ll like, so I think I should forget it.”</p>
<p>Out of interest, Zhou Wen used his phone’s camera to take a look at the Stone Qilin Companion Egg. Then, he was surprised to discover that the stats of the Stone Qilin egg had the talent skill of Qilin Dominance Body.</p>
<p>Is it that coincidental? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. He carefully took a closer look and indeed, there was the Qilin Dominance Body Primordial Energy Skill. Furthermore, the other stats were pretty good. It was likely one of the most excellent Stone Qilins.</p>
<p>“How much is a Stone Qilin Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If you are paying in cash, 150,000 and you have yourself a deal.” When the boss saw that Zhou Wen was a student of Sunset College, he expected him not to have any high-valued dimensional crystals, so he only reported the price in terms of the League’s currency.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head with a wry smile. It was useless even if he knew that the Stone Qilin egg was an excellent-grade egg. He didn’t have the money to buy it even if he added up all the money in his accounts since it didn’t even reach 10,000.</p>
<p>Wang Lu suddenly said, “Zhou Wen, if you want this stone Qilin Companion Egg, why don’t you make a deal with me? Do me a favor and I’ll help you buy it.”</p>
<p>“What deal?” Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“I saw the video of you killing the word-engraved Demonized General. You were really impressive, so I hope that you can help me complete my homework mission,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Do you still need to spend money to hire someone to help with your homework mission?” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was a special admissions student at Sunset College, so she was definitely not weak. She could even be said to be an extremely strong person amongst her peers. It was hard to believe that a special admissions student like her, needed help in a homework mission.</p>
<p>Wang Lu smiled and said, “If it’s just a simple homework mission, I naturally don’t need your help. However, I want to get first place in class and even break the records. This requires</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“What is your homework mission?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“It’s to kill a Fairy in Lotus Flower Cave with a party of fewer than four people. There is no time limit, but the previous record is 56 seconds,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“How much time do you have left?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“There are still six more days.” Wang Lu counted with her fingers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and said, “Alright, deal.”</p>
<p>Wang Lu’s goal was exactly the same as his. Zhou Wen had to go to the Lotus Flower Cave anyway. It was best if he could download Dragon Gate Grotto as a game dungeon; otherwise, he had to enter the Lotus Flower Cave and kill a Fairy himself. He wanted to see if he could get the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. Making a trade with Wang Lu in passing wouldn’t affect his plans.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was very straightforward. Upon hearing Zhou Wen agree to the trade, she directly bought the Stone Qilin egg for 150,000. She didn’t even blink her eyes or ask for a discount. It delighted the boss so much that he couldn’t even contain his joy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony either. After receiving the Stone Qilin egg, he placed it in his backpack.</p>
<p>“Do you want to head to the Lotus Flower Cave now?” Zhou Wen asked. He felt extremely responsible when it came to mercenary jobs.</p>
<p>“I’d like to make a trip to the Old Dragon Cave first. If you have nothing to do, why don’t we go take a look together?” Wang Lu invited.</p>
<p>“I’ll pass. This is my phone number. Call me before going to the Lotus Flower Cave.” Zhou Wen gave Wang Lu his phone number.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was somewhat taken aback. It was her first time seeing such an insensitive man as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This person is really interesting. Wang Lu didn’t mind and turned to head to the Old Dragon Cave.</p>
<h3 id='chapter97'>Chapter 97 Mobile Game</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the nearby stalls and used his mysterious phone’s camera to take a look at all the Stone Qilin Companion Eggs. As Wang Lu and the boss said, there were very few Stone Qilins that possessed the Qilin Dominance Body, so he didn’t discover a second one.</p>
<p>It was common for students to use their phones to take photos. Zhou Wen’s actions were not out of the blue, nor did he attract the attention of others.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone’s functions are impressive, but unfortunately, I’m too poor. Even if I can discover excellent-grade Companion Eggs, I wouldn’t have the money to buy them. Zhou Wen felt vexed.</p>
<p>It was impossible to sell the Companion Egg to earn money because although he knew that the Companion Egg was an excellent-grade egg, others didn’t know that. It was impossible for others to buy an unknown Companion Egg at the price of an excellent-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The dimensional crystals in the game could not be used, so they could not be exchanged for money.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that unless he sacrificed some gaming time, it would be difficult for him to obtain money.</p>
<p>“Hey there, hey there, you are a freshman this year, right?” As Zhou Wen walked, a stall owner held him back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that the stall owner was about the same age as him and was wearing Sunset College’s uniform. He was also probably a student from Sunset College, so he asked, “I’m a freshman who recently matriculated. What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Junior, you came to Dragon Gate Grotto right after you matriculated. It’s obvious that you are a diligent student. However, dimensional zones are dangerous and you don’t know much about the dimensional zones in Dragon Gate Grotto. Entering like that is extremely dangerous. I have something good here that can allow you to understand the dimensional zone before entering,” the student-like stall owner said.</p>
<p>“I’ve already seen all the information available from the school.” Zhou Wen prepared to continue walking forward.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen about to leave, the young stall owner hurriedly peddled his service. “Junior, don’t leave. It’s useless just reading that information. Those things are dead after all. No matter how much you read them, it doesn’t imbue you with deeper memory from experiencing it yourself. I have something here that can make you faster than others. You will be able to understand the situation inside deeply before entering.”</p>
<p>“What is it? Show it to me.” Zhou Wen sized up the young stall owner curiously.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen’s interest, the young stall owner hurriedly took out his cell phone and opened a game app on his phone. Then, an extremely simple game interface appeared.</p>
<p>“Junior, this is a mobile game app I created. Don’t write it off just because of its graphics. The map and monsters here are designed according to Dragon Gate Grotto’s actual terrain and dimensional creatures. After playing this mobile game, you will have a full understanding of the Dragon Gate Grotto dimensional zone…”</p>
<p>The graphics of the mobile game were very simple, but this student’s creativity made Zhou Wen’s eyes light up.</p>
<p>“Senior, did you make this game yourself?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the game interface.</p>
<p>“That’s right. A person’s time and capabilities are limited after all, so it’s a little crude. However, I can guarantee that the content is absolutely real. They are places that I have personally been to. Those dimensional creatures were also seen with my own eyes.” The young stall owner came close to Zhou Wen and said, “Junior, download it. It’s absolutely beneficial for you. You can download it from the official app store. It’s only a hundred bucks.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll download it to take a look. What’s your name, Senior?” Zhou Wen found the game app on the app store according to the name he was told.</p>
<p>“My name is Huang Ji. Junior, you have good taste. Work hard.” Seeing Zhou Wen download his game, Huang Ji was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen launched on the game and played. He realized that the controls were smooth and the graphics were crude. The avatars’ and dimensional creatures’ actions were stiff like robots.</p>
<p>“Senior Huang, can you improve this game and make it more real?” Zhou Wen asked as he played.</p>
<p>“Of course I can. However, that requires a professional team and a large amount of money. I don’t have that much time or money right now, so I can only make it like this for the time being.” Huang Ji said regretfully.</p>
<p>“If given a professional team and funding, what level of development could you push it to?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>He was really interested in this game. If such mobile games became popular in the future, then no one would be suspicious of him if he kept gaming on his phone.</p>
<p>Huang Ji said, “The technology these days is actually very mature. However, gaming is gaming after all. It’s different from real battles. The officials haven’t invested too much in this area. If a person wants to do it, the amount of technical support and resources needed is too much. It’s especially so when it comes to funding. The average person would find it difficult to obtain the huge sums needed. Furthermore, even if one really developed it, they wouldn’t be able to provide precise information to the experts who could venture deep into the dimensional zones. That would make the game meaningless as it would be better to just watch videos.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before asking, “Senior, if I can obtain a large amount of funds, are you willing to make this game better?”</p>
<p>“Do you have money to invest? How much can you invest?” Huang Ji’s eyes lit up as he asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t have money for the time being,” Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.</p>
<p>“Then let’s wait until you have money.” Huang Jing was very disappointed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. He didn’t have any money, so there was no point in saying anything. All he could do was ask Huang Ji for a contact number before seeking him out when he had money.</p>
<p>After separating from Huang Ji, Zhou Wen continued walking forward in search of the tiny palm symbol that might exist. However, he failed to discover it despite nearly reaching Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, why haven’t you reached Lotus Flower Cave?” Wang Lu called him and urged him to meet up at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you go to Old Dragon Cave?” Zhou Wen asked casually as he continued walking forward slowly.</p>
<p>“I waited inside Old Dragon Cave for quite some time, but I didn’t see any treasure light, nor did I hear any dragon roars. I had no choice but to head to the Lotus Flower Cave now. Come quickly,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t far from Lotus Flower Cave, so as he walked he carried on searching. Soon, he arrived at the entrance of Lotus Flower Cave and saw Wang Lu waiting for him outside.</p>
<p>There were soldiers guarding outside Lotus Flower Cave, preventing ordinary people from entering. Wang Lu took out two passes before leading Zhou Wen inside.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the same counselor as you. Is it really fine for me to participate in your homework mission?” Zhou Wen asked while examining the situation inside Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>“No problem, as long as it’s a student from our school,” Wang Lu said nonchalantly before continuing. “The record for Lotus Flower Cave was maintained by a fourth-year named Huang Ji. We have to break his record this time, so I need to ensure that all the steps are done well. I’ll leave the recording to you later. You must do a good job filming me…’</p>
<p>“What’s the name of the senior that maintained the record?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Huang Ji,” Wang Lu repeated.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be the same person, right? Zhou Wen recalled Huang Ji who had used rather pushy sales tactics to promote his game app. He felt that it was probably just two people who shared the same name.</p>
<h3 id='chapter98'>Chapter 98 Fairy Monkey</h3>
<p>There were no real lotus flowers inside the Lotus Flower Cave. Instead, there was a huge lotus stone sculpture carved on the ceiling. Around the stone statue were many graceful flying fairies.</p>
<p>According to the school database, the gigantic lotus flower sculpture was where a dimensional rift was located. Occasionally, a dimensional creature would burrow out of the dimensional rift, looking as though it had flown out of a lotus flower.</p>
<p>Dimensional creatures that appeared in the Lotus Flower Cave were currently limited to creatures known as Fairy Beasts. However, they were different from the fairies in the murals. Dimensional creatures called Flying Beasts didn’t look beautiful. Instead, they were like monkeys, so Fairy Beasts were also known as Fairy Monkeys.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill that Zhou Wen needed was a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal that dropped from Fairy Monkeys. However, there were very few Fairy Monkeys. The chances of it dropping a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal were even lower.</p>
<p>Before the dimensional storms happened, the Lotus Flower Cave had been an individual cave, but now, there were many caves that connected to it. Each cave had a lotus flower ceiling and fairies. There were also many sculptures of Buddha, Bodhisattva, Malla, and monks.</p>
<p>Lotus Flower Cave had been sealed for a period of time, so it would have accumulated quite a lot of Fairy Beasts. However, the numbers were only enough for special admissions students. Therefore, every special admissions student only had two chances. If they couldn’t obtain their ideal results after killing two Fairy Monkeys, they were not allowed to continue killing them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Wang Lu through the different lotus flower caves and finally found a Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Zhou Wen’s impression of a monkey was an animal with brown fur, but it was actually covered in white fur. Its eyes were bloodshot with a pair of white wings on its back.</p>
<p>When the Fairy Monkey noticed Zhou Wen and Wang Lu, it immediately bared its teeth and charged over.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to use this? Help me take a good shot. You have to keep up with my speed. Make sure that I look good in it.” Wang Lu handed a special camera to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you hired me just to film you?” Zhou Wen said as he took the camera.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What other reason would there be?” Wang Lu said as she charged at Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>Rich people are really willful! Spending 150,000 bucks for a videographer? Zhou Wen couldn’t understand the thought process of rich people.</p>
<p>However, he quickly learned why Wang Lu was hiring.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey’s Speed was extremely fast and it was good at flying. It moved like a ghost in the sky, making it impossible for an ordinary person to keep up with it.</p>
<p>Wang Lu changed her movement technique as a pair of butterfly-like wings spread open on her back, allowing her to actually keep up with Fairy Monkey’s speed.</p>
<p>If it were any ordinary person to do the filming, they would only be able to shoot from afar. They wouldn’t be able to follow Wang Lu’s figure. Zhou Wen summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and kept filming while riding on its back. He could barely keep up with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Before long, Wang Lu’s saber beam flashed as the Fairy Monkey was struck down. It fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>“How long did it take?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen without looking at the Fairy Monkey’s corpse.</p>
<p>“One minute and five seconds.” Zhou Wen looked at the time of the camera and gave an accurate account of the time.</p>
<p>“Did I take that long? It’s still quite a distance from Huang Ji’s record.” Wang Lu frowned slightly. Clearly, her results were not satisfactory.</p>
<p>However, Wang Lu only had two chances, so she wasn’t in a rush to find another Fairy Monkey. She called out to Zhou Wen and they left Lotus Flower Cave together.</p>
<p>“If I want to break the record, it looks like I still need a more detailed plan. Let’s end it here for today. Let’s do it again next time.” Wang Lu took back the camera and watched her battle with the Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>“Call me when you need me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Of course, you only have to help me do the filming.” Wang Lu had no intention of letting Zhou Wen help her. She had to break Huang Ji’s record alone, or it would be meaningless.</p>
<p>After separating from Wang Lu, Zhou Wen continued following the stone stairs and looking around Dragon Gate Grotto, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>There were many palm imprints within Dragon Gate Grotto. The Fairies, Buddhas, Malla, and Monks had different palm symbols, but they were different from the ones Zhou Wen remembered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was beginning to wonder if the Dragon Gate Grotto didn’t have any tiny palm symbol when he suddenly felt his mysterious phone vibrate. He took it out and switched on the camera. Soon, he found a tiny hand symbol in some inconspicuous spot on the mountain wall. It then locked onto the symbol.</p>
<p>I’ve finally found it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>The position of the tiny palm symbol was very inconspicuous. It wasn’t as beautiful and eye-catching as the other Buddha palm imprints. It simply extended its five fingers and held a picture of a sitting Buddha.</p>
<p>If one took a closer look, one would realize that the Buddha pattern in the hand was very similar to the biggest Buddha statue at Dragon Gate Grotto. However, it was just several times smaller.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the camera function and aimed it at the tiny palm symbol. Indeed, a scene was locked onto it.</p>
<p>In that case, I can grind Lotus Flower Cave without any qualms. Zhou Wen only wished to obtain Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and then attempt to rush up Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>Very quickly, Dragon Gate Grotto was downloaded onto his phone, forming a Buddhist icon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tapped on the Dragon Gate Grotto’s icon. This time, he didn’t enter the game like before. Instead, many options appeared.</p>
<p>Ancient Yang Cave, Myriad Buddha Cave, Old Dragon Cave, Lotus Flower Cave, Inferno Cave. There were plenty of options.</p>
<p>After he chose the Lotus Flower Cave, the blood-colored avatar entered the game interface of Lotus Flower Cave. Inside the cave filled with mysterious colors, a gigantic lotus flower sculpture was situated in the middle of the dome, surrounded by symbols of Fairies, Monks, and Malla.</p>
<p>A Fairy Monkey burrowed its head out of the stone lotus flower and pounced at the blood-colored avatar while screaming with its teeth bared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to face the Fairy Monkey. Instantly, the two dimensional creatures—which were equally outstanding at flight-began having an aerial battle in Lotus Flower Cave.</p>
<p>Finally, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant took nearly ten minutes to slay the Fairy Monkey, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued walking deeper into the Lotus Flower Cave with the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant summoned. He hoped to test it to know how strong it was after becoming a Legendary through the fusion.</p>
<p>Seeing a Fairy Monkey charge at him, the lotus flower on the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s head suddenly bloomed, revealing a venomous toad. It spewed venom at the Fairy Monkey, instantly drenching it.</p>
<p>The Fairy Monkey yelled as it rolled on the ground, its fur and skin corroded as blood gushed out.</p>
<p>The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant charged forward without any hesitation and stabbed at the Fairy Monkey with its bone-spiked front claws, impaling its head and chest.</p>
<p>47 seconds! Zhou Wen looked at the time. From the beginning of the battle to the system’s indication of the Fairy Beast’s death, it took a total of 47 seconds. He had already broken Huang Ji’s record.</p>
<p>The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant is really powerful! Zhou Wen was delighted. The more he looked at it, the more adorable it looked.</p>
<h3 id='chapter99'>Chapter 99 Ancient Imperial Sutra</h3>
<p>Although the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant was very strong, its own Primordial Energy was limited. It wasn’t able to keep using Primordial Energy Skills. However, even if it didn’t use any Primordial Energy Skills, the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could easily kill a Fairy Monkey.</p>
<p>Fairy Monkeys often produced dimensional crystals, but they were mostly Speed Crystals. Occasionally, it would drop some Primordial Energy Crystals, allowing Zhou Wen to replenish the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen believed that the Primordial Energy Crystals were rather useful. He only had two Companion Beasts at the moment, but he already needed plenty of Primordial Energy Crystals to replenish his Primordial Energy. In the future, with more Companion Beasts, the Primordial Energy Crystals would be even more useful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s nothing like a storage bag in the game. Otherwise, I could store up the Primordial Energy Crystals and use them when needed. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, he heard a chime.</p>
<p>After a Fairy Monkey was killed, a dimensional crystal dropped. Zhou Wen took a closer look and saw that it was a crystal with the words Fairy Monkey on it. He was delighted.</p>
<p>Fairy Monkeys typically only had one Primordial Energy Skill, which was Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. He had never heard of there being a second Primordial Energy Skill. Now that a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal dropped, it was definitely Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to pick it up.</p>
<p>Wisps of white light floated out of the crystal and drilled into the blood-colored avatar’s body. Zhou Wen also felt a strange power surge from his phone into his body. It opened up a strange aura circulation path that allowed him to feel light as though he could fly at any moment.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had expected, this was the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. The information regarding it also surged into Zhou Wen’s brain at the same time, giving him deep knowledge about the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>‘Attained Dragon Gate Fairy Skill (Rank 6)’</p>
<p>With Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, I can attempt to storm Fire God Platform. Zhou Wen was delighted. As he was about to leave Dragon Gate Grotto, he suddenly saw a dimensional creature burrow out of the lotus flower situated at the Lotus Flower Cave’s ceiling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that a Fairy Monkey had appeared and planned on killing it before leaving, but upon careful inspection, he realized that it wasn’t a Fairy Monkey, but a female fairy with fluttering clothes.</p>
<p>The fairy had a graceful figure, and her silk ribbons were dancing in the air. Although she did not have any wings, she was able to spiral and fly in midair, completely defying the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Is this a real Fairy? Zhou Wen looked enviously at the beautiful Fairy. There was some discomfort using wings to fly, so it was better to fly freely like a Fairy.</p>
<p>The Fairy spun a few times before flying towards the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to charge forward in battle. However, the beautiful Fairy waved her hand gently, sending a ribbon to sweep over like a white python. Even the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Silver Wing Flash failed to dodge the ribbon that resembled a living creature. The blood-colored avatar and the two Companion Beasts were soon coiled together.</p>
<p>The Fairy in the air pulled and tightened the grip on the ribbon, rupturing their bodies and causing the game screen to instantly darken.</p>
<p>What a terrifying Fairy! Zhou Wen marveled inwardly.</p>
<p>He didn’t continue gaming as he put away his phone. He planned on returning to his dorm before dripping blood and making a trip to the Fire God Platform. He wanted to see if he could rush up Fire God Platform with a Rank 6 Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and see what was engraved on the stone monument.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen eagerly launched the Ancient Imperial City dungeon. He dripped his blood to be reborn and rode the Silver-Winged Flying Ant towards the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was fully prepared. He rushed up the stairs on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s back, dodging all the firebirds without killing them. The higher he charged, the more firebirds appeared.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen could only rely on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s flight, but now, the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill had also given him a pretty good ability that allowed him to hover in midair.</p>
<p>Just as a firebird was about to hit the blood-colored avatar, the blood-colored avatar leaped up in the air and spiraled in midair like a giant bird. It circled around the firebird and avoided its attack before landing on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s back.</p>
<p>Although the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill didn’t allow for true flight, it could allow one to hang in midair for a short period of time, making one look cool and elegant.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With the blood-colored avatar rushing past the furthest he had reached last time, the Fire God Platform’s flames surged into the sky as flocks of firebird-like clouds descended upon him, their numbers inestimable.</p>
<p>I’m dead! Zhou Wen knew that no matter how agile he was, it was impossible for him to charge through the dense flock of firebirds. All he could do was try his best.</p>
<p>The lotus flower on top of the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s head exploded like a bomb, turning into a rain of blood that killed many nearby firebirds. Taking the moment when the pressure of the firebirds lessened, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant charged into the sky and broke through the firebirds’ encirclement.</p>
<p>However, there were too many firebirds. They immediately gathered together and blocked their path.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its wings and charged towards the firebirds, colliding with the firebirds at the head of the flock. As for the blood-colored avatar, it leaped up under Zhou Wen’s control and circled above the sky like an eagle.</p>
<p>One firebird after another was dodged by the blood-colored avatar as it reached an unprecedented height. Through the holes in between the firebird flock, he saw half of the stone monument.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sharp eyes immediately saw that the largest three ancient characters on the stone monument were “Ancient Imperial Sutra.” And when he saw the three words clearly, a ball of fire seemed to rise within him.</p>
<p>However, the moment he saw those three words, the blood-colored avatar was inundated by the flock of firebirds. The game screen quickly turned black.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for me to rush up with a technique that imbues me with alacrity. However, I can now see a part of the stone monument. If my movement skills are better, I can hold on for a longer period of time. I’ll then be able to memorize parts of the monument’s content. This way, I don’t have to reach the peak. Zhou Wen held his phone as he thought.</p>
<p>He felt that this idea was feasible, but his movement skills were still lacking. He wanted to last longer and see more of the content, so he needed a higher ranked movement skill.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to continue grinding the Lotus Flower Cave. Peeking at the Ancient Imperial Sutra could wait until he first grinded a Rank 9 Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was trying his best to grind Fairy Monkeys, the first homework mission that Wang Fei assigned finally came to an end. Although some students were unable to complete their homework mission, they were not expelled. They only had some homework points deducted.</p>
<p>Wang Fei convened a meeting with all her students and announced her second homework mission. It was for them to visit Mount Laojun to look at the Wordless Monument.</p>
<p>When the mission was announced, Wang Fei gave Zhou Wen a meaningful glance—this mission had originally been prepared for him.</p>
