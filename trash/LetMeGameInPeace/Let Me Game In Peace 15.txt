<h3 id='chapter1400'>Chapter 1400: Fusing Skill</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the Venusian instance dungeon when it finished refreshing. This time, he wanted to see if he could crack the fatal seventh bullet.</p>
<p>Spacetime Bandit, Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, Absolute Space, Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, and other skills were used according to his repeated practice.</p>
<p>A miniature Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array formed around Zhou Wen. This Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had the Lunar Mansion Array as its core. With the augmentation of spatial skills, it formed a small periodic space around Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In theory, any attack that entered would be trapped in the looping space forever. It was like walking into the orbit of a Möbius loop.</p>
<p>Of course, in fact, it didn’t have such a powerful effect. It only used the tricks of array formation and spatial swapping to make the prey enter alternating spaces.</p>
<p>When the bullet shot by, the Metal Guard was within three feet of Zhou Wen. It immediately changed from taking a straight line to exhibiting circular motion around Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>A large number of bullets spun around Zhou Wen like a galaxy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already done the experiments. Typical Mythical bullets were indeed unable to break through the restrictions of the looping space, but Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if they could withstand a Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>After killing all the Metal Guards, the Golden Battle God appeared. The Terror-grade bullets failed to break through Zhou Wen’s protective array. The bullets could only revolve around his body.</p>
<p>After killing all the Golden Battle Gods, he obtained two stat crystals. One had 89 Strength and the other 91 Essence Energy, raising Zhou Wen’s two stats. He was still a distance away from his 99 stat limit.</p>
<p>An ear-piercing alarm sounded. Zhou Wen felt a little uneasy, unsure if he could block the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A bullet shot out from the tunnel. With Zhou Wen’s present strength, he could already see the trajectory of the bullet when he activated The Disqualified.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t block it and allowed the bullet to reach his body.</p>
<p>When the bullet was three feet from his body, it underwent a distortion. However, it continued advancing, causing Zhou Wen’s heart to sink.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after advancing less than a foot, the trajectory of the bullet finally changed. It spun into an arc that revolved around Zhou Wen like a satellite.</p>
<p>There’s a chance! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Bullets shot over one after another. No matter where they shot at Zhou Wen, they would eventually turn into satellites that orbited him. They would only fall to the ground when all their strength was expended.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon discovered a problem. The Calamity-grade bullets shot out one after another. Before the first bullet’s force was completely eliminated, they were followed by subsequent shots.</p>
<p>As the number of bullets increased, there was a problem with the looping space. The bullets entered with increasing distance, but they got closer and closer to Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>When the fifth bullet shot in, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array around Zhou Wen immediately disintegrated. Due to the impact of the force, a gap appeared in the alternating space. Unable to swap them accurately, the balance was broken, and the entire system instantly collapsed.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the sixth shot to be fired, Zhou Wen exited the game.</p>
<p>There was still a problem with his ability. If he didn’t resolve it, there was no benefit in fighting again.</p>
<p>Just five bullets caused problems in the alternating space. I didn’t even see the seventh bullet. There appears to be a huge problem with this skill. Zhou Wen’s goal had always been to kill the Calamity creature on Venus, not just clear the level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched dungeons and constantly used skill combinations in-game to figure out where the problem was.</p>
<p>After some extended research, Zhou Wen finally gained a rough understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>It was because Zhou Wen’s alternating space was a combo formed from the combination of several skills. Once the combo deviated, its stability would be affected, easily causing the combo to crack or even collapse.</p>
<p>After trying a few times, he wanted the combo to be more perfect and optimized, but the outcome wasn’t ideal. Once he suffered a strong impact, the combo would produce slight deviations. This was something that couldn’t be completely avoided.</p>
<p>The sure-kill seventh bullet has the characteristic of perpetual attacking, but my combo can’t withstand too much pressure. In other words, it’s impossible for me to block the sure-kill seventh bullet. Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed.</p>
<p>Now that he knew that this combination could form an alternating space, but was unable to withstand the Calamity-grade bullet, Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue thinking of a different plan.</p>
<p>Since there’s no way to avoid the gap between skills, I’ll fuse them into one skill. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the only way.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What’s Little Wen doing? Why haven’t I seen him recently?” Ouyang Lan called An Sheng over and asked.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen has been studying something recently. He hasn’t left his room in days,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan looked at the empty dining table and sighed. “I clearly have a husband, two sons, and a daughter, but there’s no one to eat with me. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Madam, did Uncle Zhou go out again?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The Dugu family discovered an ancient site in a dimensional zone. They don’t understand some words, so they invited him to take a look,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he discuss it with Young Master Wen before going?” An Sheng whispered.</p>
<p>“It’s not like you don’t know his temper. He usually does whatever I say, but once there are those strange ancient texts, he won’t listen to me. I can’t do anything about him,” Ouyang Lan said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Although the Dugu family has a good relationship with us now, Uncle Zhou’s identity is special. If someone tries to use him, it will be very disadvantageous for Young Master Wen. It’s best to be careful. If we really don’t want to trouble Young Master Wen, I can get someone to accompany Uncle Zhou,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan said with a bitter smile, “It’s useless. I did send someone to protect him, but if the Dugu family really wants to touch him, how can the typical person stop them? Unless he doesn’t leave, such matters can’t be done just by providing him with bodyguards. Thankfully, nothing serious has happened up to now. He’s only a scholar after all. His cultivation is very ordinary, so ordinary people won’t make things difficult for him.”</p>
<p>An Sheng also knew that this matter was thorny. He couldn’t come up with a good solution even after some thought.</p>
<p>If they didn’t let Zhou Lingfeng out, what was the difference between that and sending him to jail? However, he couldn’t let Zhou Wen follow him 24/7, right? Typical bodyguards would be of little use when encountering powerful enemies.</p>
<p>“Go and see how Little Wen is doing. If he has the time, get him to come over to have a meal with me and have a chat. He shouldn’t stay cooped up in his room all day. He’ll end up with depression,” Ouyang Lan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll go now,” An Sheng agreed and turned to leave the hall, heading for Zhou Wen’s yard.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1401'>Chapter 1401: Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>When An Sheng arrived at Zhou Wen’s yard, he saw Jade Rabbit and Banana Fairy in the yard, but he didn’t see Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Is Young Master around?” An Sheng knocked on the door and attracted Banana Fairy’s attention before saying.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy nodded before shaking her head.</p>
<p>This action was very confusing, but An Sheng understood what she meant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was around, but he couldn’t see him.</p>
<p>“What’s Young Master doing? He hasn’t come out for days.” An Sheng was somewhat curious, but it wasn’t convenient for him to disturb Zhou Wen, so he had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from the yard. He couldn’t help but stop and turn around to leap up. He landed on the wall and looked into the yard.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the situation inside, An Sheng was alarmed. He saw that the room Zhou Wen was in was spinning crazily like a huge top.</p>
<p>“Young Master, are you alright!?” An Sheng immediately jumped into the yard and shouted in the direction of the house.</p>
<p>No one answered him. The room continued spinning faster and faster.</p>
<p>An Sheng gritted his teeth as his body shimmered with a strange glow. He held a Golden Battle God Gun in each hand and timed it before making a charge.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s grasp of timing was really impressive. Under such a rapid spin, he grabbed the moment when the door flashed past him and slammed it open, entering the spinning room.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” An Sheng landed in the room and realized that everything was still. It was completely different from the situation outside.</p>
<p>However, the strange thing was that the originally squarish room had bent into an arc. Furthermore, standing in the room, he could only see less than half the room’s space. Then, as though it was isolated by a mysterious force, he couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>He clearly felt that there was something there, but he just couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>“Young Master…” An Sheng called out a few more times, but there was still no response. He walked to the side of the curved room, hoping to find something.</p>
<p>The room wasn’t big, but after An Sheng walked for a while, he realized that he seemed to be walking in circles. He was still near the door.</p>
<p>Spatial power? An Sheng immediately rushed towards the door, hoping to rush out of the room.</p>
<p>However, when he rushed out of the door, he realized that he wasn’t in the yard. In front of him was still the room from before.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s expression changed immediately as he turned his head to take a look. Indeed, the door was behind him. He gritted his teeth and rushed out of the door again, only to see the same room again.</p>
<p>An Sheng tried several times, but the outcome was the same. No matter where he rushed out from, even if he broke through the wall, he found himself still in the room.</p>
<p>The entire room was like a sealed spatial cage, trapping him inside forever.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An Sheng’s expression changed constantly. Just as he was thinking about a way to escape, he heard a boom. Then, the curved room returned to normal.</p>
<p>He could now see the room that he couldn’t see previously. Zhou Wen was sitting at his desk gaming on his phone.</p>
<p>“Young Master, what happened?” An Sheng was pleasantly surprised as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean what happened? I’ve been gaming and didn’t notice anything,” Zhou Wen said as he put away his phone.</p>
<p>“This room just now…” An Sheng didn’t know how to describe it.</p>
<p>“Oh, perhaps I was too engrossed in the game and was a little excited. I accidentally exerted some strength and affected the room a little. Don’t worry, it’s not an enemy invasion,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression, momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Madam said that if you have the time, go over and have a meal with her. Overseer isn’t at home, and Miss Jing has been cultivating hard. Uncle Zhou is also out. Madam is home alone, so she can’t help but worry. Young Master, if you have the time, spend more time with her,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go,” Zhou Wen said as he stood up.</p>
<p>He was in a good mood because he had finally successfully created a new skill, not just a skill combination.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t experimented with it, Zhou Wen was already certain that his skill could trap the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>As he walked, Zhou Wen glanced at his phone’s information. Indeed, a new skill had appeared in the skill column.</p>
<p>Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation: Calamity (Rank 10)</p>
<p>Calamity-grade? Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. He had experimented countless times in-game and knew that the effects of this skill had indeed exceeded the Terror grade.</p>
<p>The only flaw of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was that it required a certain amount of time to gather strength. Although it wasn’t a long time, it was very difficult to use it in actual combat. It had to be released ahead of time.</p>
<p>However, this was enough for Zhou Wen. Releasing the Minor Heavenly Cycle killing formation ahead of time was enough to clear the Venusian instance dungeon. This was his best weapon for clearing the dungeon. However, it lacked adaptability in the face of an emergency.</p>
<p>When the Venusian instance dungeon refreshed, Zhou Wen would experiment again. If he succeeded, he could directly challenge the Cube’s ranking in reality.</p>
<p>While having a meal with Ouyang Lan, Ouyang Lan complained to Zhou Wen about An Tianzuo and company. Zhou Wen knew very well that it was a manifestation of her worries.</p>
<p>In this era, there were no guarantees that even a powerhouse like An Tianzuo wouldn’t die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t good at consoling others, so he could only sit and listen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After the meal, he returned to his room. Zhou Wen attempted to sink his consciousness into the Chaos Bead to see if the Soul Mirror’s evolution was completed.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was prepared. He made his consciousness stay far away from the Soul Mirror. The space in the Chaos Bead was huge, almost infinite. It was impossible for the rainbow beams emitted by the Soul Mirror to illuminate everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhou Wen’s consciousness wasn’t injured by the Soul Mirror. However, he could see from afar that an area was enveloped by rainbow beams. He couldn’t see anything in that area.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it hasn’t completed its evolution. Zhou Wen checked the things in the chaos space. Thankfully, he had already deliberately placed the Soul Mirror in a relatively distant space, so it didn’t cause any damage to the other things in the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly did a scan and was taken aback when he saw Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man had previously been interested in metal, so Zhou Wen placed him and metals into the chaos space together. Now, Explosive Fiend Man looked like a metal robot. It was completely enveloped by a metal carapace, with only two transparent crystal jars on its back. One could see a strange purple liquid in the jar.. The purple liquid was bubbling like boiling water, giving off the feeling that it would explode at any moment.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1402'>Chapter 1402: Spacetime Fiend Man</h3>
<p>When did this fellow evolve? Zhou Wen didn’t see the metal parts. When he sensed Explosive Fiend Man’s aura, he realized that it had already reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>After unsummoning Explosive Fiend Man, he used his phone to look at his information.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Unlawful</p>
<p>Life Soul: Destroyer</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Annihilation</p>
<p>Terror Form: Spacetime Fiend Man</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast</p>
<p>Companion Form: Self-detonation Device</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully studied his stats. The power of the Wheel of Destiny augmented his explosive power, greatly enhancing his destructive forces.</p>
<p>As for the Terror transformation ability of Spacetime Fiend Man, it was probably tied to the metal parts.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen carefully studied the notes of Spacetime Fiend Man, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that this was the most terrifying ability of Explosive Fiend Man.</p>
<p>Spacetime Fiend Man was actually an ability similar to resurrection, but it wasn’t true resurrection. Perhaps calling it a replica would be more accurate, but it wasn’t completely accurate.</p>
<p>To put it simply, after Explosive Fiend Man used the Self-detonation Device, he could revive again.</p>
<p>Or rather, Explosive Fiend Man from another spacetime would come to this spacetime and replace the previous Explosive Fiend Man. Unfortunately, in the same spacetime, only one Explosive Fiend Man could exist. Therefore, it was equivalent to a resurrection skill.</p>
<p>With such a Terror transformation ability, Explosive Fiend Man is equivalent to a big boss who can self-destruct infinitely. If I don’t like anyone, I can just send him charging forward and self-destruct… Zhou Wen knew how terrifying Explosive Fiend Man’s self-destruction was. It was a one-time release of all his energy.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for creatures of the same level to withstand such self-destruction.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen entered the game excitedly, hoping to see how powerful Explosive Fiend Man was.</p>
<p>The Venusian instance dungeon’s cooldown hadn’t ended, so Zhou Wen took Explosive Fiend Man to Yang City, planning on using the Blood Spirits for testing.</p>
<p>When the Blood Spirits appeared, Explosive Fiend Man charged forward under Zhou Wen’s orders. Zhou Wen realized that his actions seemed to have some spatial compression or temporal acceleration effect. He became very fast.</p>
<p>Explosive Fiend Man rushed past a Blood Spirit and reached out to press it down, installing a time bomb. When he pulled away, the time bomb immediately exploded, shattering the Blood Spirit into pieces.</p>
<p>This fellow was like a punctual time bomb installer. Anything touched by his hands would turn into a bomb and detonate its energy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also noticed that when Explosive Fiend Man’s fingers touched something, a purple liquid would drill out. It was likely the liquid in the bottles behind him. The liquid turned whatever he touched into a bomb.</p>
<p>This fellow is a little strong! Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>Unless one was faster than Explosive Fiend Man and could avoid contact with him or had a stronger defense, preventing the purple liquid from being effective, anyone he touched would die.</p>
<p>Let’s try the Self-detonation Device. Zhou Wen got Explosive Fiend Man to charge at a Blood Spirit.</p>
<p>As Explosive Fiend Man hugged a Blood Spirit, his body turned into a Self-detonation Device device that enveloped the Blood Spirit’s body. In the next second, there was a boom.</p>
<p>A purple sun rose in Yang City and devoured a large area. Wherever the power of self-destruction passed, everything was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, it’s so powerful! The power of this self-destruction is almost at the Calamity grade! Zhou Wen was so overjoyed that he could hardly close his mouth.</p>
<p>However, he was somewhat depressed. Although the Spacetime Fiend Man had shown its effects, Explosive Fiend Man couldn’t be revived immediately. He had to wait twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Forget it. Twenty-four hours is good as long as he can be revived. Otherwise, the Self-detonation Device would be a useless skill. I wouldn’t dare use it in reality. I don’t have so many qualms now. Zhou Wen was very satisfied.</p>
<p>When the Venusian instance dungeon refreshed, Zhou Wen entered it again and activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.</p>
<p>When the Calamity-grade bullets shot in front of Zhou Wen, they immediately circled around his body. The first six bullets didn’t affect Zhou Wen at all. Instead, Zhou Wen absorbed their energies and they quickly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The sure-kill seventh bullet similarly failed to penetrate the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. It kept spinning in the formation, its power absorbed by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that was transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As its strength was rapidly drained, the seemingly perpetual seventh sure-kill bullet ultimately fell.</p>
<p>I’ve finally succeeded! Zhou Wen quickly instant transmitted into the tunnel, hoping to find the Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>Now that the bullet could no longer injure him, as long as he could find the Calamity-grade creature, there was a high chance of killing him.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s guess, the Calamity-grade creature’s body definitely wasn’t strong. Perhaps he didn’t need a powerful weapon to kill him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen failed to find the Calamity-grade creature despite constantly instant transmitting in the tunnel.</p>
<p>He found nothing every time he rushed in the direction of where the bullet came from.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suffered countless Calamity-grade bullets, but he still failed to find the Calamity creature. He came up with all kinds of solutions. Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener’s abilities to their limits, but he still couldn’t find his location.</p>
<p>This Calamity-grade’s body definitely isn’t strong. As long as I can find him, killing him shouldn’t be difficult. Zhou Wen was increasingly certain that his previous guess was right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t find him. It was useless even if he knew that he could kill him.</p>
<p>Although I can’t find him, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation should be enough to clear the dungeon. I wonder what rank I’ll get. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure what rank he would receive.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, his method of level clearing was actually in the same vein as using the Heavenly Robe to clear the level. Both prevented the bullets from hitting him.</p>
<p>Therefore, in theory, if he couldn’t kill the Calamity creature, it was very likely that he could only obtain a three-star grading like before.</p>
<p>No, I have to think of a way to kill him no matter what. If I don’t get first place, what’s the point of getting on the rankings? After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that getting a three-star was meaningless. He had to get first if he wanted to be on the rankings.</p>
<p>“Young Master, someone has offered a high price for the Heavenly Robe. Unfortunately, he’s not from the League of Guardians.” An Sheng called.</p>
<p>“Is the price very high?” Zhou Wen had previously told An Sheng that he wanted to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians. Yet, An Sheng had even informed him under such circumstances, indicating that the price offered was probably extraordinary.</p>
<p>“Very high.” An Sheng enunciated each word clearly.</p>
<p>“Who’s buying? What’s the price?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“The Cape family. The starting price is enough for us to use the accelerator again. We can discuss the exact price later,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s meet and talk.” Zhou Wen was originally determined to sell it to the League of Guardians, but he didn’t feel strongly about it anymore. It didn’t matter who he sold it to.</p>
<p>As for the Cape family, they had always been at odds with Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t mind letting them bleed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1403'>Chapter 1403: Negotiation</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The Cape family also knew that they had a deep grudge with Zhou Wen, so they planned on paying a high price to obtain the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went to the meeting room and saw the Cape family’s negotiator.</p>
<p>The person’s name was Wood. He wasn’t a direct descendant of the Cape family. An Sheng had heard that the Wood family’s ancestor was the head butler of the Cape family, and he slowly became a part of the Cape family.</p>
<p>“What a promising young man you are, Mr. Zhou. I’ve always wanted to meet you, and my wishes have come true today.” When Wood saw Zhou Wen and An Sheng stand up, he immediately stood up and walked over to shake Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wood, thank you for the compliments. Let’s get down to business.” Zhou Wen shook Wood’s hand before walking to the main seat and sitting down.</p>
<p>An Sheng and another officer sat on both sides of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll get straight to the point. Mr. Zhou, can you name a price for your Heavenly Robe? It will also let us know if we have the capital to obtain it. If we have the funds, we can continue negotiating. If we don’t have the funds, no one needs to waste time. Don’t you think so?” said Wood.</p>
<p>“A thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals. That’s my bottom line. Not one gram less.” Zhou Wen had already discussed it with An Sheng before coming.</p>
<p>He had originally thought that Wood and the other representatives would bargain. After all, a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals was just too much. Even Zhou Wen felt that it was impossible to sell it at such a price.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, Wood didn’t haggle and agreed immediately. “Sure, we are willing to exchange a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals for Heavenly Robe.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. When’s the deal?” Zhou Wen and An Sheng exchanged looks. They felt that things weren’t that simple.</p>
<p>Indeed, Wood said, “However, Mr. Zhou, Adjutant An, you should know that a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals is a staggering amount. Ignoring our Cape family, even if the six families combine their resources, it’s a question if they can gather that many Essence Crystals.”</p>
<p>“Then what did you mean? Are you messing with me?” Zhou Wen deliberately said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“How dare I mess with you, Mr. Zhou? We do have a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals, and we are willing to use a thousand tonnes to buy Heavenly Robe. However, Mr. Zhou, you’ll need to dig up these thousand tonnes himself,” said Wood.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“So here’s the problem. It’s true that we can’t take out a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals immediately, but we do have a high-quality Essence Crystal mine. Furthermore, the reserves of Essence Crystals definitely won’t be less than a thousand tonnes. It might even be two thousand or three thousand tonnes…” Wood’s tone was very provocative.</p>
<p>“You mean to say that you want to exchange the Essence Crystal mine for my Heavenly Robe? Do you think we have the ability to dig Essence Crystal ores in the West District?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. The Essence Crystal mine I’m talking about isn’t in the West District. It’s in the East District. However, other than our Cape family, no one knows its location. However, we’ve already specially explored it. The Essence Crystal mine there definitely has more than a thousand tonnes. If you don’t believe me, you can send professionals to explore the Essence Crystal mine during the transaction. After confirming the reserves, you can give us the Heavenly Robe,” said Wood.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wood, that’s not what we agreed upon. We’ve been talking about physical item exchanges,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Of course. If we had a thousand tonnes of Essence Crystals, we would definitely want to buy the Heavenly Robe. However, in fact, the Essence Crystals we can offer now amount to only about 800 tonnes. We really can’t afford to pay such a huge sum. If possible, we can use money or Companion Beasts to cover the rest,” Wood said with a sincere expression.</p>
<p>“How about this? We didn’t know about your suggestion before. We need to hold another meeting to study the feasibility. How about we continue tomorrow?” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Of course. We sincerely hope that we can complete this deal.” Wood and company left the meeting room.</p>
<p>“The Cape family sure is scheming. They want to use our East District’s Essence Crystal mine to exchange for the Heavenly Robe. This is equivalent to them doing a business without any capital. They definitely won’t be able to mine the Essence Crystal mine on a large scale. Over time, it will definitely be discovered by others. Sooner or later, they would lose its ownership,” An Sheng said with a cold snort after they left.</p>
<p>“You mean you don’t plan on doing the exchange?” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“No, if you agree, Young Master Wen, it’s best we continue the trade. Although the mine is in our East District, we don’t know where it is. We can’t guarantee that our people will discover it first in the future, so we have to do the exchange if possible. However, before that, we have to ensure that the mine can be safely mined and the goods transported back safely,” An Sheng answered straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen understood what An Sheng meant. Most of the Essence Crystal ores were in dimensional zones. If that dimensional zone was too dangerous and humans couldn’t stay in there for long, it was useless no matter how many Essence Crystals there were.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the Essence Crystal mine was too far from Luoyang and was in an area that Luoyang’s power couldn’t reach, even if it was mined, it would be easily snatched away by others midway.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll leave the negotiation to you.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to waste time on such matters. He still had many things to do.</p>
<p>Now that he had advanced to the Terror grade, he needed a plan on how to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>His stats definitely had to increase first, but if he only increased his stats, he definitely wouldn’t be able to advance to the Calamity grade even if he reached the limits of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already seen a few Calamity grade advancements. Tsukuyomi had relied on the power of a dimensional zone to advance to the Calamity grade. When she advanced to the Calamity grade, the dimensional zone had nearly collapsed due to excessive expenditure.</p>
<p>There was also Jiang Yan’s Skyimmortal and Fairy Burial’s advancement to the Calamity grade with the help of Perfect Sword Immortal.</p>
<p>Then there was Zhou Wen’s Soul Mirror. He had clearly sensed powerful energy infuse into it, allowing it to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summarized that advancing to the Calamity grade required immense energy. Furthermore, this energy wasn’t ordinary Essence Energy. No matter how much Essence Energy ordinary people had, it was impossible for them to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen hoped that a Calamity-grade dimensional zone would appear. When the time came, he could observe how dimensional creatures used the dimensional zones to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen vaguely felt that he could use their method to use the dimensional zones’ powers to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Dimensional zones… Calamity Zones… No matter how I think about it, these two are related… Perhaps dimensional zones are the key to my advancement to the Calamity grade… Zhou Wen thought to himself, but as he hadn’t heard of any Calamity creatures appearing recently, he didn’t have the chance to observe it even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>In the next few days, An Sheng kept negotiating with Wood and company, but Wood and company weren’t willing to compromise on some key issues. There was no progress in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Finally, Wood raised a condition for Zhou Wen to attempt the Venusian dimensional zone again. He was not to use any other Companion Beasts and could only use Heavenly Robe.. If Zhou Wen could clear it, they were willing to compromise.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1404'>Chapter 1404: The Unbelievable Heavenly Robe</h3>
<p>“It looks like the Cape family has been suspicious of the Heavenly Robe’s effects from the beginning. They have long planned to make this request, and to do it now, if we don’t agree to this condition that seems to be beneficial to us at this step in the negotiations, it’s equivalent to telling them that there’s a problem with the Heavenly Robe. When the time comes, I’m afraid no one will buy our Heavenly Robe. But if we agree…”</p>
<p>An Sheng paused for a moment to which Zhou Wen replied, “Then agree to it.”</p>
<p>An Sheng was taken aback. “Young Master, didn’t you say that only Companion Beasts with high luck can bring out the effects of the Heavenly Robe? Now, the Cape family wants you to only use the Heavenly Robe. How are you going to clear it?”</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem. If they want to see the Heavenly Robe, let them. I can now achieve the same effect even without the Heavenly Robe,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I see. That’s great. In that case, I need to work harder.” An Sheng’s eyes revealed a cold glint.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it wouldn’t be wrong to leave such matters to An Sheng. He wouldn’t suffer any losses, so all he needed to do was prepare to clear the dungeon.</p>
<p>After a day, An Sheng had already finished negotiating with Wood and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could do the attempt, but other than the Essence Crystal mine, the Cape family needed to provide an additional hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals.</p>
<p>This hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals was equivalent to a deposit. After Zhou Wen completed the test, they would hand over the Essence Crystal mine.</p>
<p>Under An Sheng’s arrangements, Zhou Wen signed a contract with the Cape family’s representative. If Zhou Wen couldn’t rely on Heavenly Robe to clear the Venusian dimensional zone and enter the rankings, he would have to pay an additional hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals for the breach of contract.</p>
<p>The moment the contract was signed, the Cape family released the contract’s content through their official channels.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen couldn’t do it and refused to refund the deposit, the entire Federation would know of this matter. Even if the An family did refund the Essence Crystals, it would deal a huge blow to Zhou Wen and Luoyang’s An family’s reputation. It would still spell quite a loss and setback.</p>
<p>Regardless, Zhou Wen had to clear it.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen actually agreed to the Cape family’s request?” Xia Liuchuan wore a look of surprise after reading the press release.</p>
<p>Anyone would find it unbelievable that a Terror-grade Companion Beast—Heavenly Robe—could perfectly withstand a Calamity-grade attack. There had to be other supplementary means and Companion Beast abilities augmenting it to reach that level.</p>
<p>Many people had the same thoughts as Xia Liuchuan. After Zhang Chunqiu finished reading, he revealed a pensive expression. Clearly, he didn’t believe that a Terror-grade Heavenly Robe could clear the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had agreed to such a request. This left Zhang Chunqiu somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>With the same question in mind, many people focused on the Cube, hoping to see how Zhou Wen would handle it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t make them wait too long. Soon, the Cube lit up and a projection of the Venusian dimensional zone’s external platform appeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Heavenly Robe, stood on the platform.</p>
<p>He was only wearing the Heavenly Robe. Apart from that, he didn’t have anything else on him. He didn’t even have accessories like rings. He looked extremely clean and tidy.</p>
<p>Here it comes. Could it be that the Heavenly Robe is really that effective against the Calamity creature in Venus? Xia Liuchuan found it unbelievable when he saw Zhou Wen’s attire. He clearly didn’t plan on using other Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The Cape family paid more attention to this battle. If Heavenly Robe could really perfectly dodge the Calamity-grade attack, they naturally wanted to obtain it.</p>
<p>Ignoring the value of being on the rankings, just dodging a Calamity-grade attack made it priceless.</p>
<p>However, they were also very suspicious. If it really had such powerful abilities, why did Zhou Wen want to sell it? Although the reason given by the An family made sense, they were still somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped his blood to activate the Venusian dimensional zone as everyone watched him enter.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the Metal Guard, Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill and killed it with one strike.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Metal Guards rushed out and were wiped out by Zhou Wen in the blink of an eye. Their bullets couldn’t injure him at all.</p>
<p>After a Golden Battle God rushed out, the bullets that shot out could only circle around Zhou Wen without touching him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen charged forward and killed it with one strike. He didn’t even dodge the bullet.</p>
<p>The six Golden Battle Gods were killed by Zhou Wen, and a Companion Egg dropped. It made one envious and jealous.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away the Companion Egg and charged into the tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi and company, who were watching the Cube’s live broadcast, couldn’t help but feel nervous. After all, it was still doubtful if the Terror-grade Heavenly Robe could single-handedly block a Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>After the gunshot, a Calamity-grade bullet appeared around Zhou Wen. It spun around him like a bolt of lightning. It looked very similar to Zhou Wen’s previous attempts at clearing the level, perhaps even stronger.</p>
<p>Previously, it was only the sure-kill bullet that had spun around Zhou Wen, but now, even the bullets at the beginning were spinning around him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the bullets as he quickly traversed the tunnel and headed for the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Gunshots sounded as bullets appeared around Zhou Wen one after another, but they could only circle around him and failed to injure him, nor could they stop him from advancing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very fast. Before the sure-kill seventh bullet shot out, he had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>But Zhou Wen stopped in front of the stairs just like Immortal. He didn’t ascend the Golden Palace but waited for the seventh bullet to arrive.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The sure-kill seventh shot finally sounded as a bullet with lightning sparks appeared around Zhou Wen. It was more dazzling than the halo formed by the other six bullets.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there without moving, allowing the seven bullets to circle around him.</p>
<p>That Heavenly Robe… can actually perfectly restrain the Calamity-grade bullets… It wasn’t just the Cape family. Many people who had been very interested in the Heavenly Robe widened their eyes.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the end. Zhou Wen, who had already proven his Heavenly Robe’s abilities, still hadn’t left.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade bullets kept firing over, but none of them could injure Zhou Wen. When the second round of sure-kill bullets circled around Zhou Wen, the Overseer Manor’s phone and An Sheng’s phones nearly exploded from all the ringing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use any other Companion Beasts, nor did he use any offensive or defensive means. This undoubtedly meant that the Heavenly Robe was the best of the best. It had unbelievable dodging abilities. Obtaining it not only allowed one to enter the rankings, but it also greatly ensured their safety. How could anyone who had the means to acquire it not want it?</p>
<p>Instantly, the Overseer Manor’s phone was busier than a particular brand’s after-sales service call.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen finally walked up the stairs and arrived in front of the Golden Palace. The scene that happened next drove people crazy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s name appeared on the rankings, but it wasn’t a three-star. Behind his name were five shiny golden stars. Furthermore, he was ranked first, squeezing out Immortal, who had only been in first place for a few days.</p>
<p>Thankfully, only one phone connection could be established at any one time; otherwise, the Overseer Manor would definitely be flooded with calls.</p>

<p>“Adjutant An, when is it convenient for Mr. Zhou? Let’s trade the Heavenly Robe as soon as possible.” Wood and the other representatives of the Cape family couldn’t sit still any longer. They took the initiative to look for An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Sorry, something happened here…” An Sheng wore a difficult expression.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Wood asked patiently, but he was already burning with anxiety.</p>
<p>After watching Zhou Wen’s performance, everyone believed that the Heavenly Robe was an excellent-grade Companion Beast. The master of the Cape family had already ordered them to bring it back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Well, someone offered a higher price than your family… As you know… My Young Master is already a little impatient with your many requests… Furthermore, others are handing over the physical goods directly…” An Sheng stammered.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, we do have a contract. With the An family’s status, you wouldn’t go so far as to violate the contract for such trivial gains, right?” Wood immediately reeled in anxiety.</p>
<p>He also knew that the display of Heavenly Robe’s abilities was shocking. Furthermore, the Cube had given a five-star evaluation, allowing Zhou Wen to reach first place. Who in the Federation didn’t want the Heavenly Robe?</p>
<p>The headlines of the various media outlets were all reporting about Zhou Wen and Heavenly Robe. Anyone with the means was probably eyeing the Heavenly Robe now.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to break the contract either, but you know the abilities of the League of Guardians. Now that they want the Heavenly Robe, do we dare not give it to them?” An Sheng sighed.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s the League of Guardians? Even if Immortal himself comes, he has to be reasonable, right? Why don’t we do this? Adjutant An, get Mr. Zhou to complete the handover as soon as possible. If the League of Guardians wants to force it, get them to cause trouble for our Cape family…” Wood said.</p>
<p>“This… The risk we take is too great…” An Sheng looked conflicted.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, help us settle this matter. The Cape family definitely won’t treat you unfairly… This is a token from our Cape family…” Wood stuffed something into An Sheng’s hands.</p>
<p>“No, no, no. This isn’t appropriate, right?” An Sheng said, but he turned sideways and unzipped a pocket on his jacket with one hand.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Wood had already requested permission several times. Now, it wasn’t just Wood. The upper echelons of the Cape family were filled with regret.</p>
<p>If they had known this would happen, they would have just bought the Heavenly Robe back then without all the fuss. However, by making a fuss, the price they had to pay now was ten percent higher than before.</p>
<p>Even so, the Cape family was willing to pay. They were now afraid that Zhou Wen wouldn’t sell the Heavenly Robe to them.</p>
<p>From their point of view, it was only because the An family needed a large number of Essence Crystals for the accelerator. Otherwise, no faction would exchange such a Companion Beast for Essence Crystals.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached a new agreement. Even an important member of the Cape family, Woods, rushed over overnight and prepared to personally receive the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>“As long as we can bring the Heavenly Robe back, it will all be worth it. We have to be fast and not delay any further. Otherwise, the problem with the Essence Crystal mine will be exposed. When the time comes, it won’t be that easy to exchange for the Heavenly Robe again.” When Woods arrived, the family head’s exhortations were still ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Woods knew that this matter couldn’t be delayed. After rushing to Luoyang, he immediately contacted An Sheng and Zhou Wen to head to the Essence Crystal mine with him to carry out the transaction.</p>
<p>The location of the Essence Crystal mine wasn’t very far from Luoyang. Coincidentally, it was near Guide City. The dimensional zone was originally under Guide City’s jurisdiction, but it was no longer inhabited. There were dimensional zones everywhere.</p>
<p>I never expected there to be an Essence Crystal mine here. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this place. His grandfather had brought him here a few times when he was young.</p>
<p>Back then, this was a mausoleum. It had turned into a valley at some point in time. Flowers bloomed everywhere in the valley as butterflies fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>As there were many dimensional zones nearby, there were many break-out creatures everywhere. The nearby humans had long moved away and headed for relatively large human cities. The vicinity was uninhabited.</p>
<p>Woods led Zhou Wen and company into the valley. It was unknown when the valley had become a dimensional zone. Strangely, there were only ordinary butterflies in the valley. There wasn’t a single dimensional creature.</p>
<p>“The reserves of Essence Crystals here are plenty. Furthermore, the Essence Crystal mine is very close to the surface, and the purity is high…” As Woods led the way, he explained. Soon, everyone saw exposed Essence Crystal ores on the nearby mountain wall.</p>
<p>An Sheng hurriedly got the experts to investigate. The preliminary conclusion was better than what the Cape family had said. The reserves here were probably far more than a few thousand tonnes.</p>
<p>Although Woods looked calm on the surface, he felt uneasy. He knew that this place looked good, but at a certain time, it wouldn’t be as beautiful and peaceful as it was now.</p>
<p>He was now hoping that An Sheng and company would quickly finish the inspection and complete the handover so that they wouldn’t notice anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only taken a casual look and didn’t discover any problems, but the emotional fluctuations in Woods’s heart were too intense. It triggered Truth Listener’s inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen knew that the Cape family didn’t have any good intentions. This place wasn’t as peaceful as it looked.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder the Cape family doesn’t mine it themselves. So there’s actually something odd about it. Zhou Wen wasn’t angry.</p>
<p>After all, he and An Sheng didn’t have any good intentions either. The Heavenly Robe wasn’t as perfect as it looked.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he circled the valley. After weighing the pros and cons, he planned on pretending not to know anything and continue completing the deal.</p>
<p>Woods’s heart was in his throat while Zhou Wen wandered around, but he pretended to not care and didn’t rush Zhou Wen and An Sheng.</p>
<p>It had to be said that Woods was indeed a wily old fox. He was extremely worried, but his expression remained stoic. If not for Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to tell that there was anything wrong.</p>
<p>After all, even An Sheng couldn’t tell what was wrong, much less someone as inexperienced as Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, Adjutant An, are there any problems?” Woods said when Zhou Wen and An Sheng returned.</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, he hadn’t discovered any problems. He was very satisfied with the reserves and purity of the Essence Crystals here, nor did he discover any potential danger factors in the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“Mr. Woods, you should know that I’m from Guide City, right?” Zhou Wen said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Woods’s heart skipped a beat, but his expression didn’t change at all. He said with a smile, “I’ve heard that Guide City is indeed an illustrious place. To be able to produce someone like Mr. Zhou and such an Essence Crystal mine means that this place is extraordinary. Unfortunately, our Cape family’s base is in the West District.. Otherwise, we would have come here to develop.”</p>

<p>“Since you know that I’m from Guide City, do you think I’m unaware that this place was originally Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum?” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem with this being Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum?” Woods asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“As one of the representatives of Daoism, will such a dimensional zone be as safe as it looks? I’m just afraid that we might end up dying here before we get to mine the Essence Crystal ores here.” Zhou Wen left some leeway as he still wanted to close the deal.</p>
<p>Woods turned somewhat nervous when he heard Zhou Wen say that. If Zhou Wen really noticed something amiss, it would be impossible for him to return with the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, you can’t have your subjective thoughts color the issue. It’s been quite a while since our discovery of the Essence Crystal ores. As you can see, there’s no problem here. If you don’t believe me, you can stay another two days or even attempt to mine the Essence Crystals. Our Cape family will definitely not lie and do something that’s at odds with the contract,” Woods said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll do as you say. We’ll stay here for a few more days. If there’s really no problem, I’ll transfer the Heavenly Robe to you immediately,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Woods cried inwardly. He only wanted to dispel Zhou Wen’s doubts verbally, but he never expected Zhou Wen to really choose to stay for a few days. If that happened, something would probably happen.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Although Woods said that, he was burning with anxiety. He was thinking about how he could get Zhou Wen to hand over the Heavenly Robe as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, make some preparations. Find a good place to set up camp and entertain Mr. Woods and the rest. They are guests from afar. We can’t slight them,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>An Sheng understood what Zhou Wen was getting at and got someone to find a place to set up camp. He even got someone to return to transport supplies over, as though they wanted to stay here permanently.</p>
<p>Woods was anxious, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, you can stay here and watch for as many days as you want, but we can’t keep delaying this deal, right? We know that you aren’t the kind of person who abides by contracts, but you have to give us a deadline, right? The family head is still waiting. We have to return and answer to him.” Woods patiently beat around the bush.</p>
<p>“Then let’s give it five days. As long as nothing happens in these five days, I’ll immediately transfer the Heavenly Robe to you and complete our deal,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Woods knew that they couldn’t wait five days. In another four days, this dimensional zone would undergo an anomaly. When that happened, everything would be for naught.</p>
<p>However, Woods couldn’t think of any way to get Zhou Wen to immediately transfer the Heavenly Robe to him.</p>
<p>Just as Woods’s brain was about to steam from an overdrive, an officer suddenly rushed over on a Companion Beast. He looked extremely disheveled and had several injuries. He looked like he had just been in a massive battle.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, bad news. A large number of break-out creatures have appeared in Dragon Gate Grotto. Governor Qin is leading the Sunset Army to mount a full defense. There are heavy casualties. Please return immediately to provide support.” The officer jumped off his Companion Beast and rushed to Zhou Wen as he stumbled and shouted.</p>
<p>“What!” Zhou Wen and An Sheng were alarmed as they got up to return.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, you can’t leave. According to our agreement, we have already led you to the Essence Crystal mine. Before you hand over the Heavenly Robe Companion Beast, you mustn’t leave this place.” Woods and company immediately stopped Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>At that moment, Woods was overjoyed. Heaven is really helping me!</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, why don’t you stay here? I’ll lead the others back to provide support,” An Sheng said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, that won’t do. Governor Qin said that a Calamity creature might appear. Young Master Wen has to return. Otherwise, I’m afraid Luoyang won’t hold… Young Master Wen, quickly return… It will be too late if you delay any further…” The officer was about to cry.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen!” An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen anxiously.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still hesitant. “This was Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum in the past. I have a nagging feeling that things aren’t that simple here.”</p>
<p>“Sigh, Mr. Zhou, you are really overthinking things. Why don’t we do this? Now that Luoyang is in trouble, we will give you a hand. We still have a portion of the Essence Crystals left, so we can give them to you. There are also some Companion Eggs here. Take them back with you as a token of our appreciation. We hope to help Luoyang tide through this crisis.”</p>
<p>Woods pointed into the valley and said, “This place is only so big. You can see everything at a glance. If there’s anything amiss, you would have long seen it. Even if you can’t see it, with so many people walking around, something would have already happened if there was danger. If you are still worried, you can circle around the area a few more times and confirm that there’s no problem. After the deal is completed, we will go to Luoyang with you to help you resist the break-out creatures. We can also stay in Luoyang for a few days. If there’s really a problem, it won’t be too late for you to come back to us.”</p>
<p>Now, all Woods wanted to do was get the Heavenly Robe in his hands as soon as possible. He would leave the rest to later.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, the bigger picture is more important,” An Sheng urged anxiously when he saw Zhou Wen still hesitating.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do as Mr. Woods says.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and walked to him. He held Woods’s hand and said, seemingly touched, “I’ll cut the niceties, but thank you for your help. Mr. Woods, you’re really a nice guy.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Woods to say a word, Zhou Wen released his grip and said to An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, quickly move everything back. We’ll head back immediately to provide support.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, about the Heavenly Robe…” Woods was a little anxious.</p>
<p>“I’ll get them to move the things. I’ll transfer it to you now,” Zhou Wen said as he began circulating his Essence Energy. His face flushed red as though he was using a forbidden ability.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to transfer the Heavenly Robe, Woods didn’t think it was right to stop An Sheng and company from moving things. All he could do was stand in front of Zhou Wen and wait for him to transfer the Heavenly Robe.</p>
<p>As transferring a Companion Beast required one to pay a considerable price, Woods felt that even if Zhou Wen had any special abilities, it was impossible for him to do so without paying a price. It was normal for Zhou Wen to look like this.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly circulated his Essence Energy, but he had no intention of doing the deed. When they finished moving most of the things, Woods couldn’t help but ask only for Zhou Wen to suddenly reach out and press his hand on his chest.</p>
<p>Here it comes! Woods immediately swallowed the words he was about to say and waited to receive the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for a while, he saw Zhou Wen’s face turn redder and redder. However, Woods didn’t sense any Companion Beast transfer. As for the things there, An Sheng and company had almost finished moving them.</p>
<p>Woods felt that something was amiss. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhou Wen roar, “Go!”</p>
<p>Woods immediately felt a force enter his body as the energy of a Companion Beast surged into his body. He was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>Soon, the Companion Beast was transferred to Woods. Zhou Wen said with a pale face, “Mr. Woods, take a look. Is it the Companion Beast we were talking about? Don’t make a mistake.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong about it. Perfect. It’s a Terror-grade Deva Companion Beast. Thank you, Mr. Zhou. Are you alright?” Woods repeatedly made confirmation. The skill was the same as what was written in the contract. He was still worried, so he summoned it and wore the robe transformed from the Deva. Seeing that it was identical to what Zhou Wen wore, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>“Since we have closed the deal, I’ll head back to provide support. Let’s do business again if there’s a chance in the future..” Zhou Wen completed the handover and signed off the contract with Woods before leaving with An Sheng.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1407'>Chapter 1407: With Heavenly Robe in Hand… Ouch…</h3>
<p>Woods was overjoyed. Although he had paid more in the end, as long as he could obtain the Heavenly Robe, everything was worth it.</p>
<p>“Mr. Woods, something seems amiss. Why did Zhou Wen and company leave so quickly without getting us to join them in Luoyang?” Wood said suspiciously.</p>
<p>However, Woods seemed to be overly excited. “The Heavenly Robe is real. There won’t be any problems. Besides, if we were to go to Luoyang, would they dare to really allow us to join them? When the time comes, not only will they not get help, but they will also have to get someone to watch us. Cut the chatter. Quick, let’s test the Heavenly Robe’s abilities.”</p>
<p>Woods stroked the Heavenly Robe on his body with an eager expression.</p>
<p>Wood summoned a bow and aimed it at Woods, but he didn’t dare to aim at his vital spots. All he did was shoot at his arm.</p>
<p>With a whoosh, the arrow tore through the air and arrived in front of Woods. Woods didn’t dodge. When the arrow arrived in front of him, the Heavenly Robe moved autonomously, pulling his body to dodge the arrow.</p>
<p>“Haha, as expected of the Heavenly Robe. With this robe in hand, it will be easy for our Cape family to enter the rankings. In the future, even if a Calamity-grade expert wants to make things difficult for our Cape family, with this robe around, we might still have the strength to put up a fight. Come, come, shoot a few more arrows at me. Let me experience the magical power of the Heavenly Robe,” said Woods excitedly.</p>
<p>When Wood saw that the Heavenly Robe was indeed magical, he was overjoyed. He immediately drew his bow and strafed a few arrows without any worries.</p>
<p>As he had confirmed that the Heavenly Robe was indeed useful, Wood didn’t target any special spots. He just randomly shot them at Woods.</p>
<p>Woods stood there without any intention of dodging. He believed that since the Heavenly Robe had allowed him to dodge the first arrow, and the subsequent arrows had the same strength as the first arrow, it would be impossible for him not to dodge them.</p>
<p>However, how could he know that the Heavenly Robe had a dodge chance? He was lucky to trigger the Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge for the first arrow, but without the augmentation of lucky equipment, the Heavenly Robe’s dodge chance wasn’t high.</p>
<p>Everyone was in a festive mood as they waited for the Heavenly Robe to showcase its magical powers. However, they suddenly heard Woods scream.</p>
<p>Out of the eight arrows that Wood shot out, five of them hit Woods, of which four hit the Heavenly Robe. Being Terror-grade equipment, the Heavenly Robe’s defense was pretty good, allowing it to block four arrows. However, one arrow hit Woods’s face; there was nothing obstructing it. It shot right into his nose, causing him to fall to the ground and roll around in pain.</p>
<p>“How can this be!” Wood and company were dumbfounded. After they reacted, they hurriedly ran to Woods and pulled out the arrow to treat his injuries.</p>
<p>“Woods, is this Heavenly Robe fake? Did you check it properly?” Wood’s expression changed as he looked at the bloody hole in Woods’s nose.</p>
<p>“It’s not fake. The information transmitted by the Heavenly Robe isn’t wrong. It’s a Terror-grade Heavenly Robe. It does have the ability to dodge. As you saw just now, the first arrow was dodged by the Heavenly Robe… But how did the subsequent arrows…” Woods was alarmed and unsure. He repeatedly confirmed the information transmitted by the Heavenly Robe. All the skills and abilities were identical to the one Zhou Wen had written in the contract. Their levels weren’t bad either.</p>
<p>“Try sensing the detailed information of those skills again. See if there’s any problem based on whatever you can sense,” Wood said.</p>
<p>Woods hurriedly sensed the information. After a while, his expression turned ugly as his body began to tremble.</p>
<p>“This dodging skill has a certain chance. Not all attacks can be dodged. We’ve been scammed.” Woods was trembling in anger.</p>
<p>“How did this happen? How did Zhou Wen use it to dodge all the Calamity-grade attacks?” Wood asked in a daze. He now understood that they had been fooled. There were probably no break-out creatures in Luoyang. Zhou Wen and company were deliberately scamming them.</p>
<p>“How would I know!” Woods was beyond tears. He suddenly struggled to get up and took out his phone to call An Sheng. As he called, he said hatefully, “No, this matter isn’t over between us and the An family. We have to make them give us an explanation.”</p>
<p>After the phone rang a few times, An Sheng’s voice sounded. “Mr. Woods, do you have any business to offer us?”</p>
<p>“An Sheng, that Heavenly Robe can’t dodge attacks 100%. You guys were pulling off a scam,” said Woods angrily.</p>
<p>Although he knew that being angry was useless, he couldn’t hold it in.</p>
<p>They originally thought that they had exchanged an unmineable mine for a huge bargain, but they never expected that the thing they had exchanged for was equally useless. They had even lost nearly two hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals.</p>
<p>He originally only needed to pay an additional hundred tonnes, but with the bribe he had given An Sheng and Zhou Wen’s subsequent scam, it was almost worth an additional hundred tonnes.</p>
<p>An Sheng said calmly, “Mr. Woods, please don’t say that. Our An family has always been trustworthy. It’s impossible for us to sell you fake goods. Is the level and ability of the Heavenly Robe identical to what’s written in the contract? If there’s no discrepancy, how can it be a fake Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“But this Heavenly Robe only has a chance of dodging. Even a Mythical attack can’t be completely dodged, much less a Calamity-grade attack,” said Woods in exasperation.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re talking about that? Of course. The dodging ability of the Heavenly Robe requires the augmentation of the Luck stat. The higher the Luck stat, the higher the success rate of dodging. If you need it, we also have Luck Companion Beasts for sale,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Woods, Wood, and company were taken aback when they heard that. Woods said in disbelief, “It still needs the augmentation of the Luck stat? Didn’t Zhou Wen only use Heavenly Robe previously? How did he dodge all of them?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Woods, you can’t make such a comparison. My young master is a lucky person blessed by the heavens. He received the favor and care of the heavens and was born with abundant luck. No matter how low the chances are, it’s a hundred percent chance when it comes to my young master. However, it’s different for ordinary people. They still need some lucky equipment to achieve the ideal effect of the Heavenly Robe.” An Sheng’s words were clearly saying: “How can you unlucky fools compare to my young master? Don’t you know what kind of trash you are?”</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, are you sure that lucky equipment can increase the dodge chance? What kind of lucky equipment can achieve a 100% dodge chance?” Woods suppressed the urge to curse An Sheng and asked softly.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m sure. If you don’t believe me, you can experiment with lucky equipment. As for how many Luck stat augmentations are needed, I know that too well. Previously, my young master had bought quite a lot of lucky equipment. It was thanks to that equipment that he was able to reach a 100% dodge chance. Now that the Heavenly Robe has been sold to you, those lucky Companion Beasts are useless. If you want them, I can persuade my young master to transfer them to you. I’ll definitely give you a discount on the price. After all, you are old customers,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try first. We’ll talk about the Luck Companion Beast later.” Woods hung up and braced himself to contact the head of the Cape family to tell him the entire story.</p>
<p>“Come back and try using the Luck Companion Beasts first before we discuss the necessary countermeasures.” The Cape’s family head knew that it was pointless saying anything now. All he could do was let them return first. If they could achieve a 100% dodge chance with the augmentation of the Luck stat, it wasn’t unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1408'>Chapter 1408: It’s Really Nothing</h3>
<p>After the Heavenly Robe was brought back to the Cape family by Woods, they quickly experimented. After using Luck Companion Beasts to augment it, its dodge chance increased, but it was still far from 100%.</p>
<p>However, they confirmed that the Luck stat had an augmentation effect on the Heavenly Robe’s dodge chance. An Sheng wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>However, as there were very few lucky Companion Beasts to begin with, the typical person would hatch them upon obtaining one. Therefore, the Cape family didn’t have any Luck Companion Eggs available. They could only buy them on the market.</p>
<p>However, when they wanted to buy Luck Companion Eggs, they realized that they couldn’t buy any on the market with Luck stat and skills. There were only a few Luck Companion Eggs on sale. Even those at the Legendary and Epic stage were sold at astronomical prices.</p>
<p>“Damn it. It must be those bastards from the An family,” Woods cursed hatefully.</p>
<p>“We should have known this long ago. Since the Heavenly Robe has such a requirement, Zhou Wen must have already plundered all the Luck Companion Eggs on the market. It’s normal for the price of Luck Companion Beasts to increase.” The Cape family head thought for a moment and said, “However, as long as we can gather enough Luck equipment and make the Heavenly Robe dodge chances 100%, everything will be worth it. Let’s talk to the An family and see if we can buy Luck Companion Beasts from them. We have to try our best to buy the Luck Companion Beasts from other places as well. I reckon the An family won’t sell all their Luck Companion Beasts to us.”</p>
<p>At this point, the Cape family head could only continue. Otherwise, the Heavenly Robe he had spent a large sum of money to buy would be useless. It could even be said to be trash.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Robe’s defense was much weaker than armor of the same level. Its dodge chance wasn’t 100%, so it was unknown when one would be hit if they wore it. Who dared to use their lives to test their luck? It was equivalent to being useless.</p>
<p>Now, they still believed that the Heavenly Robe could achieve a 100% dodge chance. After all, Zhou Wen had relied on the Heavenly Robe on clearing the dungeon. There was unlikely to be anything wrong with that assumption.</p>
<p>They were right, but unfortunately, they didn’t know that the augmentation of ordinary lucky equipment could only increase the dodge chance to a very high percentage, but it wouldn’t ever reach 100%. One needed Wang Lu’s Invincible Lucky Star to obtain a 100% dodge chance.</p>
<p>The Cape family contacted An Sheng again and proposed to buy some Luck Companion Beasts. However, the price An Sheng offered nearly made them curse.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, the Heavenly Robe was bought from you. Luck Companion Beasts should be considered accessories. It’s not appropriate for you to demand such a high price, right? If this matter were to spread, would anyone dare to do business with the An family in the future?” Wood, who was in charge of this matter, said as he suppressed his anger.</p>
<p>As for Woods, he had been temporarily abandoned by the Cape family due to his previous mistake. Wood was fully in charge of buying Luck Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“We strictly followed the contract and completed the transaction. We didn’t do anything against our conscience. There’s nothing we can’t let others know. Besides, there are countless people vying for a good item like the Heavenly Robe. You shouldn’t go against your conscience and smear it, right?” An Sheng said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Wood was first taken aback before he understood what An Sheng meant. He immediately felt choked.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s meaning was very clear. Now that the Heavenly Robe was in the hands of the Cape family, if they revealed the problem with the Heavenly Robe, its value would crash. It would also let others know the weakness of the Heavenly Robe. The Cape family would end up being on the losing end.</p>
<p>If the Cape family didn’t tell others, others would still be afraid of the Heavenly Robe. Perhaps there would be a chance to sell it in the future.</p>
<p>Wood had no choice but to suppress his anger and negotiate with An Sheng. This was because there were too few Luck Companion Beasts that could be bought on the market. No matter how angry he was, he could only buy them from the An family. Otherwise, the Heavenly Robe would only be a piece of Terror-grade equipment with ordinary effects.</p>
<p>“Has the Heavenly Robe been sold to the Cape family?” As Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons, Wang Lu called.</p>
<p>“The Companion Eggs have been sold? How much did you get?” Zhou Wen immediately knew that the Cape family had definitely bought a Luck Companion Egg from Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Only a few dozen times more expensive than the purchase price,” Wang Lu answered easily. After knowing that Zhou Wen was selling the Heavenly Robe, she began acquiring all the Luck Companion Eggs on the market. Most of them were in her hands.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve earned so much, the debt I owe you should be written off, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Those are two separate matters. Furthermore, I earned it with my own abilities. Why should I count it as payment?” Wang Lu curled her lips.</p>
<p>“You’ve earned so much, yet you’re still so greedy?” Zhou Wen was helpless.</p>
<p>“You’re already first on the rankings, but aren’t you still working hard to advance?” Wang Lu paused and asked, “How’s Little Chan?”</p>
<p>“She’s still on the Moon. Don’t worry. I just went to visit her two days ago and she’s learning from Lady Supreme Yin. Lady Supreme Yin is an impressive existence. If Little Chan learns from her, there’s a high chance that she will become an impressive figure in the future.” Zhou Wen had indeed visited Wang Chan, but her situation wasn’t as optimistic as he had said.</p>
<p>Wang Chan had suffered quite a bit under Lady Supreme Yin. She cried and shouted about returning with Zhou Wen. It wasn’t easy for Zhou Wen to get her to continue staying there.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I don’t really have extravagant hopes that she will become an impressive figure. As long as she won’t be troubled by misfortune in the future and can live happily, that’s enough.” Wang Lu also knew that Wang Chan definitely wouldn’t have it easy. Success didn’t come easy in this world.</p>
<p>To be able to follow a powerhouse at the level of Lady Supreme Yin was indeed an opportunity for Wang Chan. If Wang Chan could control her abilities in the future, be it for Wang Chan herself or the entire Wang family, it would be an excellent outcome.</p>
<p>“By the way, when are you going to repay the debt you owe me? Don’t just give me lip service every time, alright?” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“Have you had dinner?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Not yet. Why? Do you want to treat me to dinner? You are still in Luoyang, so you won’t make it in time, right?” As Wang Lu spoke, she suddenly heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say not to call me over for dinner?” Wang Lu said in puzzlement.</p>
<p>There was no answer from the door. The person outside continued knocking.</p>
<p>“I already said not today…” As Wang Lu spoke, she opened the door. Before she could finish her sentence, she was stunned. The person standing outside the door was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be too late to treat you to dinner, right?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>After advancing to the Terror grade, the teleportation accuracy of Singularity Universe was much higher with the activation of The Disqualified. Typically, teleportation only had a deviation of twenty to thirty kilometers. Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good this time. He landed only a few kilometers away from Wang Lu’s house, so he quickly rushed over with instant transmission.</p>
<p>“That depends on what you are treating me to. I’m very picky,” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll do the cooking. It should be alright,” Zhou Wen said as he took out utensils and ingredients from the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>He set up a stove in the yard and quickly made a few dishes. He even took out the sake wine that An Sheng had prepared for him and decorated the dining table beautifully.</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Lu walk over, Zhou Wen hurriedly went over and pulled out a chair for her.</p>
<p>Wang Lu sat down and looked at the spread that Zhou Wen had meticulously prepared. She curled her lips and said, “Speak. What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“How can there be anything the matter? I’m just treating you to a meal,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to say it now, don’t say it today. I don’t like to hear nonsense while eating.” Wang Lu rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>“Ahem. Actually, it’s really nothing serious. I just haven’t been very lucky recently. I keep failing at fusion when I’m gaming. I want to rub off some good luck from you,” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1409'>Chapter 1409: I’m Not Your Tool</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Dream… On…” Wang Lu said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Just pretend I didn’t say anything. Hurry up and eat.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, Zhou Wen had finally obtained a Mutated Overlord Snake Companion Egg. An Sheng had also helped him collect some relatively suitable Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>However, considering the low success rate from before, it was very difficult to fuse Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable with just one Mutated Overlord Snake.</p>
<p>If he had Wang Lu’s luck, the success rate would be much higher.</p>
<p>However, if Wang Lu wasn’t willing, Zhou Wen wouldn’t force her. He would try fusing again when he returned.</p>
<p>“How’s the Wang family’s situation now? If you need help, just inform me.” Zhou Wen sat down opposite Wang Lu and uncapped the wine. He poured a glass for Wang Lu and one for himself.</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem to survive, but the Wang family hasn’t found a path that we can call our own. Standing at a fork in the road, we don’t know how to proceed.” Wang Lu smiled and raised her wine glass, clinking it gently with Zhou Wen’s. “Cut the crap. How did you get on the rankings? Don’t tell me you relied on Heavenly Robe.”</p>
<p>“I’ve mastered a spatial circulation skill. The effects are similar to Heavenly Robe. It can prevent the Calamity-grade bullets from injuring me,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder you don’t need my Invincible Lucky Star,” said Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t need it. After all, it’s yours. How can I keep hoarding it? Besides, you have to keep safe. With the Invincible Lucky Star and Heavenly Robe, at least you won’t be injured so easily in the future,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Has the sun risen in the west? You are actually worried about me?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Of course. If anything happens to you, who can lend me their luck?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>If looks could kill, Zhou Wen would probably have been diced by Wang Lu’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Go to hell. Don’t come looking for me again. I’m not your tool,” Wang Lu said through gritted teeth as she stood up angrily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly went over to press down on her shoulders and made her sit down again.</p>
<p>“Don’t be angry. I didn’t mean that. Even if you don’t have luck, I don’t wish for you to be injured. Luck and whatnot are just a bonus. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to lend it to me,” Zhou Wen hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“Humph, that’s more like it.” Only then did Wang Lu sit down and continue eating.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted about what had happened during their school days and recalled their beautiful youth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t mention using Wang Lu’s luck again. He wasn’t someone who liked to force things.</p>
<p>“Do you still have records of the debt?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu after the meal.</p>
<p>“It’s all in my notebook. Don’t even think about reneging on it.” Wang Lu took out a small notebook from her pocket and patted it smugly.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s strike off one using today’s meal and I’ll slowly repay the rest in the future. I have to return now.” Zhou Wen packed his things and prepared to return to Luoyang.</p>
<p>He couldn’t leave Luoyang for too long during An Tianzuo’s absence.</p>
<p>“Hey.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to leave, Wang Lu stopped him.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen turned to look at Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“Don’t you find it cloying to eat so much meat? Eat an apple to detox your stomach.” Wang Lu threw a clean apple at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I don’t like apples.” Zhou Wen really didn’t like apples.</p>
<p>“Eat it.” Wang Lu glared.</p>
<p>“Why are you glaring at me? I’ll eat it, alright?” Zhou Wen took a bite. It was rather sweet. Zhou Wen waved his hand as he ate the apple. “I’m returning. I’ll pay you back your meals another time.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting.” Wang Lu smiled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen teleported back to Luoyang, but his luck wasn’t good. He landed more than fifteen kilometers away. Thankfully, this distance was nothing to Zhou Wen. He quickly returned to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Since I can’t borrow Wang Lu’s luck, I can only fuse them myself. However, I can’t have too much hope. I just need to fuse Ever-Victorious or Unstoppable. I don’t have any extravagant hopes of having both skills. Zhou Wen returned to his room and took out his phone before putting Tyrant Behemoth into the fusion column.</p>
<p>Now, Tyrant Behemoth had four skills—Penetration, Tearing, Armor Breaker, and Poison Fang. Apart from Poison Fang, the other three skills were good skills that could increase its destructive power.</p>
<p>Let’s see if I can fuse Unstoppable. Zhou Wen placed the Companion Egg on it.</p>
<p>As he had two Unstoppable Companion Eggs thanks to An Sheng, he could try twice. If he failed to fuse Unstoppable, he could try Ever-Victorious next.</p>
<p>Although he knew that the chances of both skills succeeding were very low, Zhou Wen still wanted to give it a try. He couldn’t bring himself to give up.</p>
<p>However, even if he failed this time, it would likely leave behind one of the skills. If he didn’t fuse it with other Companion Eggs, he wouldn’t have both skills wiped out.</p>
<p>As the Unstoppable Companion Egg had three skills, Zhou Wen didn’t dare guarantee that he could fuse Unstoppable on the first try. All he could do was try his luck.</p>
<p>After tapping on fusion, Tyrant Behemoth and the Companion Egg lit up and fused together, leaving only Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Tyrant Behemoth’s skills and was immediately delighted. Tyrant Behemoth’s skill had an additional Unstoppable. The other skills didn’t change. The Armor Breaker, Penetration, and Ripping that Zhou Wen needed hadn’t been wiped out.</p>
<p>I succeeded in one try. From the looks of it, my luck isn’t bad. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Zhou Wen placed the Mutated Overlord Snake on it and clicked on the fusion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little uneasy. It probably wasn’t easy to retain both skills. Furthermore, this Mutated Overlord Snake had two skills. Apart from Ever-Victorious, it also had a Bite skill.</p>
<p>It felt like a useless skill. In theory, Bite might replace other skills, so there was still quite a risk.</p>
<p>However, since he had the goods, Zhou Wen couldn’t feel at ease if he didn’t give it a try.</p>
<p>As the light lit up, Zhou Wen’s heart hung higher and higher, almost jumping out of his throat.</p>
<p>When the light dissipated, Tyrant Behemoth appeared again. From its appearance, it was no different from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its information and his mouth gaped open.</p>
<p>Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Poison Tooth, Biting, Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable. Zhou Wen counted several times. There was no mistake about it. There were a total of seven skills. Both Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable were present.</p>
<p>It actually succeeded. There are even seven skills. Great! Zhou Wen nearly jumped up in joy as though he had eaten a ginseng fruit. He felt refreshed and indescribably comfortable.</p>
<p>He hadn’t succeeded despite all the fusions in the past. Now, not only had he succeeded, but he had also ended up with seven skills. Although Poison Fang and Bite didn’t seem to be of much use, they were better than nothing.</p>
<p>Should I try fusing a bloodline again? With everything going so smoothly today, Zhou Wen was eyeing the bloodline function again.. If he succeeded, he could allow Tyrant Behemoth to have two Life Providences.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1410'>Chapter 1410: The Great Tyrant Behemoth</h3>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s Life Providence gave it immense strength, augmenting it greatly. It was very compatible with Tyrant Behemoth who had Absolute Strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wondering what Life Providence he should add to Tyrant Behemoth if he could make it have dual Life Providences.</p>
<p>He wondered whether to add an offensive Life Providence, a defensive Life Providence, or a support-type Life Providence.</p>
<p>If it was a defensive-type, Life Providences like Undying Body and Unbreakable were very useful. If one could be obtained, it would be of great help to Tyrant Behemoth’s survivability.</p>
<p>However, the owners of these two Life Providences were Zhou Wen’s main Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to use them as bloodline materials for Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>It was fine if he succeeded, but if he failed, it would be a huge loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen could only choose low-level Companion Beasts as fodder. Life Providences of low-level Companion Beasts weren’t necessarily bad. In fact, many low-level Companion Beasts had very powerful Life Providences. It was only because their levels were too low that they couldn’t showcase their true might.</p>
<p>For example, the Mutated Overlord Snake’s Born Overlord was a very powerful Life Providence. It augmented one’s physique, especially their strength.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was a Strength-type Companion Beast. If it had the Life Providence of Born Overlord, its Strength would probably be off the charts.</p>
<p>There was also the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell’s Mountain River Absorption. Coupled with a glutton like Tyrant Behemoth, it would be rather impressive. However, during the fusion process, Zhou Wen had wiped out Tyrant Behemoth’s default Mountain Consuming skill. Otherwise, it would be a pretty good choice.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was Primordial Spore’s Eternal Immortality and the Great Might Vajra Bull’s Extreme Might, Extreme Strength Life Providence—both extremely powerful Life Providences.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen really couldn’t bear to use these rare Companion Beasts as supplementary material. They were unique existences that would probably be difficult to find after fusing them.</p>
<p>I should check all of my low-level Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen looked through all the low-level Companion Beasts he had obtained and saw quite a number of powerful Life Providences, but there weren’t many that were compatible with Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>After some choosing, Zhou Wen still felt that Born Overlord or Mountain River Absorption were most suitable.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had used all the Mutated Overlord Snake Companion Beasts for skill fusion. He didn’t have any on hand. Instead, he had the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell. As its level was relatively low, it was useless now.</p>
<p>I’ll try using the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell. After all, the success rate of the bloodline function is very low. If I fail, I’ll farm Mutated Overlord Snakes in the future. Zhou Wen found the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell and placed it in the Bloodline fusion column as a material before clicking on ‘fuse.’</p>
<p>The Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell immediately transformed into a ball of light that flew towards Tyrant Behemoth and fused into its body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope because he had previously attempted the Bloodline function many times to no avail. Today, he was just taking advantage of his good luck and was happy to give it a try.</p>
<p>System Notice: Tyrant Behemoth has successfully fused a bloodline. Obtained Life Providence: Mountain River Devouring. Activated Tyrant Behemoth Bloodline. Obtained Talent Skill: Mountain Devouring. Obtained Talent Skill: Rampage. Obtained Talent Skill: Behemoth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. After a while, he reacted and hurriedly opened Tyrant Behemoth’s information.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Strength, Mountain River Absorption</p>
<p>Life Soul: Violent Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength</p>
<p>Terror Form: Tyrant</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming, Rampage, Behemoth, Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Poison Fang, Bite, Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>This… This is way too strong… Zhou Wen was so happy that he couldn’t close his mouth.</p>
<p>With ten skills and two Life Providences, Tyrant Behemoth was now a unique excellent-grade Companion Beast. It was almost impossible for it to exist in reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to know how powerful Tyrant Behemoth was.</p>
<p>After opening the Yang City dungeon and entering the game, Zhou Wen didn’t let Tyrant Behemoth turn into a glove and instead had it appear in its original form.</p>
<p>A hundred-meter-long snake Blood Spirit rushed out of a blood bone temple. Tyrant Behemoth took a step forward and its body instantly became as huge as a mountain. Its claws extended out like lightning and grabbed the snake’s neck.</p>
<p>The originally gigantic snake body was like a loach in Tyrant Behemoth’s claw. No matter how it struggled, it couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>The snake’s body wrapped around Tyrant Behemoth’s arm. Tyrant Behemoth used all its strength to snap the snake’s bones, separating the snake’s head from its body.</p>
<p>Way too violent! With a thought from Zhou Wen, sword beams shot out and struck many blood bone temples like a storm. Immediately, hundreds of Terror-grade Blood Spirits roared and charged out.</p>
<p>Among the Blood Spirits were many primordial behemoths. They were huge, but in front of Tyrant Behemoth in its behemoth form, they didn’t seem big at all.</p>
<p>It was as though some ordinary behemoths were attacking a behemoth king. Tyrant Behemoth looked like a super boss no matter how one looked at it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as Tyrant Behemoth tore the Blood Spirits into pieces with a swipe of its claws. It swallowed several Blood Spirits with a single mouthful. Such a boss-like demeanor made him have the urge to fight the boss and loot whatever drops he had.</p>
<p>Despite both being at the Terror grade, Tyrant Behemoth’s suppression of the Blood Spirits was like a Calamity-grade suppression of a Terror-grade creature. It looked like a creature on a completely different level.</p>
<p>This fellow is too powerful! My luck is so good today. I should try it again! Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to kill the Blood Spirit while he activated the Bloodline function. He wanted to see if he could fuse Prisoned Dragon’s Life Providence.</p>
<p>Prisoned Dragon had the Unbreakable Life Providence. If he gave it a Life Providence like Vajra Body, its defense would definitely rise to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Vajra Malla as material and used the Bloodline function on Prisoned Dragon.</p>
<p>‘Bloodline fusion failed… Bloodline fusion failed… Bloodline fusion failed…’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried several times and used up all the Vajra Malla Companion Beasts he had, but he failed to succeed.</p>
<p>Why is my luck gone just like that! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth was surrounded by hordes of Blood Spirits. As it was too large, it couldn’t deal with every angle. Many Blood Spirits pounced on it and bit it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to help Tyrant Behemoth when he suddenly saw a sanguine glow emit from Tyrant Behemoth’s body. A blood-colored crown appeared on its head as it opened its mouth and sucked at its surroundings.</p>
<p>The surrounding Blood Spirits were sucked into its bottomless mouth. Without even chewing, it swallowed them.</p>
<p>Sick! Despite being at the same Terror grade, Zhou Wen felt that Tyrant Behemoth’s destructive power was more powerful than his.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1411'>Chapter 1411: Drop Galore</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Finally, Tyrant Behemoth’s killing alarmed the Kui in the stone temple. The stone temple’s door opened as the Kui lay inside and opened its mouth to roar at Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth opened its mouth and wanted to rush forward to devour the Kui, but unfortunately, before it could reach it, its body was struck by the thunderclap-like roar. Blood gushed out as all the bones in its body constantly shattered.</p>
<p>Just as it reached the front of the stone temple, Tyrant Behemoth’s body exploded. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere—it ultimately failed to withstand the Kui’s sonar wave attack.</p>
<p>After all, it’s still a Terror-grade body. Compared to a true Calamity-grade, its physical strength and defense are much weaker. However, Tyrant Behemoth’s offensive strength should be infinitely close to the Calamity grade. In its boxing glove form, it should have a chance of killing the Kui. Zhou Wen wasn’t depressed about Tyrant Behemoth not being Kui’s match.</p>
<p>He directly used a drop of blood to respawn and revive Tyrant Behemoth in-game before entering Yang City again. This time, Zhou Wen made Tyrant Behemoth turn into the boxing glove.</p>
<p>A black boxing glove wrapped around Zhou Wen’s palm. To his surprise, Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove form had changed. It was somewhat different from before.</p>
<p>In the past, there were two ox horn-like spikes at the front of the fist, but now, there were four spikes. However, they had become much smaller and extended out from the joints like four tusks.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen punched, the four tusks would stab into the enemy’s body first.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tusks were black-red in color and looked like they contained poison. It was likely caused by the Poison Fang skill.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stormed all the way in and stirred the Kui again. It roared from the stone temple, but unfortunately, it couldn’t injure Zhou Wen. With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation protecting him, even the terrifying sonar wave attack was trapped in the looping space, preventing it from reaching Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After the Kui came out of the stone temple, Zhou Wen took the opportunity to instant transmit onto its back while it roared, striking at its neck with the Tyrant boxing glove.</p>
<p>Typical creatures had harder skulls, but their necks were relatively weak. With Zhou Wen’s punch, the four tusks at the front of the Tyrant’s boxing glove tore through the Kui’s hide and stabbed into its flesh.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Kui let out a painful cry as it unleashed a sonic attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already instant transmitted into the distance. After the Kui’s sound wave passed, he teleported behind it and threw another punch at its neck.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he constantly vanished and appeared around the Kui. The fist wrapped in the Tyrant boxing glove struck the Kui’s neck again and again.</p>
<p>Although the Kui constantly released sound waves, it couldn’t injure Zhou Wen with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around. All it could do was passively take a beating.</p>
<p>In a certain sense, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was far better than the Heavenly Robe’s dodging. The Heavenly Robe could only dodge single-target attacks, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation could even block area-of-effect attacks.</p>
<p>However, if the strength exceeded the limits of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, then it wouldn’t be as effective as Heavenly Robe’s 100% dodging. There were pros and cons.</p>
<p>The Tyrant boxing glove’s offensive strength could indeed injure the Kui, but it wasn’t easy to kill it with a few punches.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that with the Kui’s self-healing ability, it would take more time to kill it, but he soon realized that the wound caused by the tusks constantly bled black blood. The Kui’s self-healing ability seemed to have been greatly reduced. Its self-healing speed couldn’t keep up with the injuries Zhou Wen caused.</p>
<p>The Kui’s neck was riddled with holes. Many of its bones had already fractured. In its rage, it roared at the sky, sending sound waves through the entire Yang City dimensional zone.</p>
<p>It was still unable to break through Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. After it roared, Zhou Wen instant transmitted behind it and punched the back of its mangled neck.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Kui’s neck, which had already fractured in many places, couldn’t withstand it any longer. Its head drooped down.</p>
<p>Even so, the Kui wasn’t dead. It jumped up with its single leg in a rage, wanting to slam into Zhou Wen with its body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it couldn’t even touch Zhou Wen when it was perfectly fine, much less with its neck broken. It couldn’t even make a sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly instant transmitted and attacked. After more than half an hour, the Kui’s body finally collapsed. Then, there was a tinkling sound as several crystals dropped.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Drop galore! Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly scanned the area and saw Essence Energy Crystals, Constitution Crystals, and Strength Crystals. Furthermore, their values exceeded a hundred. One of the crystals with the Kui shadow was the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen picked up the Kui skill crystal, but he didn’t pick it up himself. Instead, he got Tyrant Behemoth to take form and absorb the stat crystals.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth’s stats were 82. After absorbing one Essence Energy, Constitution, and Strength Crystal, its stats reached 99. Only its Speed stat was not maxed out.</p>
<p>With Tyrant Behemoth’s stats increased, its offensive strength would increase. It would be beneficial for Zhou Wen when killing Calamity creatures in the future.</p>
<p>There was only one Essence Energy Crystal left on the ground. After Zhou Wen absorbed it, his Strength stat reached 99. Like Tyrant Behemoth, he was unable to break three digits.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to study the Kui skill crystal, but he realized that there was something else on the ground. It was a black-and-white stone. It wasn’t eye-catching and there were words on it: Samsara Stone.</p>
<p>The Samsara Stone has finally appeared! Only then did Zhou Wen recall that there was another Samsara function in-game. However, as he hadn’t obtained a Samsara Stone, he didn’t know what it was for.</p>
<p>After studying the information on the Samsara Stone, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>The Samsara Stone can only send Companion Beasts back to their Companion Egg form, but what’s the point? It wasn’t easy for me to nurture a Companion Beast. If I were to return it to its Companion Egg form, wouldn’t I have to nurture it again? It would be a complete waste of time and energy. Zhou Wen looked at the Samsara Stone in his hand and was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t take out the items in-game, and refreshing the instance dungeon would wipe out the item, the Samsara Stone would probably disappear if he didn’t use it now.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for a Samsara Stone to drop. I have to give it a try. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and planned on trying with an unimportant Companion Beast. Apart from turning a Companion Beast back into a Companion Egg state, what other uses did the Samsara Stone have?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at his Companion Beasts and chose one to have the Samsara Stone. After the Companion Beast ate the Samsara Stone, its body immediately emitted a black-and-white glow.. Like a distorted vortex, it sucked in the Companion Beast’s body and quickly shrank into a Companion Egg.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1412'>Chapter 1412: Tripod Cauldron</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen originally had plans of trying it out with a random Companion Beast, but considering how difficult it was to receive the Samsara Stone as a drop, it didn’t seem right for it to be used on trash. After some thought, he found a relatively useful Companion Beast—Great Mighty Vajra Bull—to experiment with.</p>
<p>After the Great Might Vajra Bull turned into a Companion Egg, Zhou Wen looked at its stats.</p>
<p>Great Vajra Bull: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Great Might Divine Horns, Fury of Thunder, Infallible Vajra, Buddha Flames.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>Although the Great Might Vajra Bull was at the Mythical stage, it didn’t have any evolvable attributes. Now that it has an evolvable attribute, it has a chance of breaking through to the Mythical stage in the future. So this is the effect of the Samsara Stone. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this might not only be the sole effect of the Samsara Stone. Perhaps there were other effects that weren’t apparent to him yet. After all, the Great Might Vajra Bull had been reduced to the Mortal stage. There were still plenty of unknowns.</p>
<p>However, a Mortal Companion Beast with four skills was considered one of the best at the Mortal stage.</p>
<p>After hatching the Great Might Vajra Bull again, Zhou Wen began studying the Kui skill crystal.</p>
<p>Kui Crystal: Requires music-type Terror transformation ability, Essence Energy 99, Constitution 99.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a high requirement, but Zhou Wen didn’t have any music-type Terror transformation ability. He remembered that music-type skills in the past required spatial abilities. Why did the Kui only require music-type abilities? This made him lose the possibility of absorbing it.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t bear to part with the skill crystal, Zhou Wen had no choice but to throw it away since he couldn’t absorb it.</p>
<p>In any case, he already had the ability to kill the Kui. He still had a chance of getting it in the future, so he didn’t feel the pinch.</p>
<p>After packing up, Zhou Wen walked towards the stone temple.</p>
<p>With Yang City being so strange, it was definitely not an ordinary dimensional zone. Perhaps there was some peerless treasure.</p>
<p>If there was really any treasure, it was probably in the stone temple. The other places were all blood bone temples.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of the stone temple, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around Zhou Wen activated. He stood at the door and looked inside.</p>
<p>The decorations in the ancient temple were very simple—stone platforms and stone tables. The accessories and objects inside were basically all stone.</p>
<p>However, there was a bronze tripod cauldron on the stone platform that looked out of place with the surrounding stone tools.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed the bronze tripod cauldron and saw that there were patterns of mountains and beasts engraved on it. The mountains and beasts looked familiar as though he had seen them somewhere before.</p>
<p>Could this thing be a Nine Province Tripod? Zhou Wen thought of the legend regarding Yu the Great.</p>
<p>After Yu the Great controlled the waters, he established the first hereditary dynasty in the history of the East District, Xia, so Yu the Great was also known as King Yu of the Xia Dynasty.</p>
<p>All the vassals fought to present their gifts and gathered all the bronze in the world, bringing them to Yang City. Yu the Great melted all the bronze in the world into one furnace and forged the Nine Province Tripods, completing an unprecedented achievement.</p>
<p>This was Yang City. There was another bronze tripod cauldron in the stone temple. Furthermore, according to what Zhou Wen knew, every Nine Province Tripod had the famous mountains and rivers of the state engraved on it. They were mutated beasts and birds.</p>
<p>The symbols on the bronze tripod cauldron looked rather familiar. It was likely famous landscapes and beasts. However, due to the abstract carvings, Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to put his finger on them.</p>
<p>However, there were nine Nine Province Tripods. Zhou Wen searched the stone temple a few times, but there was only one tripod cauldron. He didn’t find any of the other eight.</p>
<p>If it’s really the Nine Province Tripod, it should be a huge treasure! Zhou Wen carefully walked into the ancient temple with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation activated.</p>
<p>Truth Listener constantly scanned the stone temple, but it didn’t discover anything abnormal. Zhou Wen circled the temple with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, but he didn’t trigger any danger.</p>
<p>Strange. Is there only one Calamity-grade Kui in Yang City? Zhou Wen was very suspicious.</p>
<p>Although the Calamity-grade Kui was very strong, Yu the Great had once killed many monsters from the Classic of Mountains and Seas. There were so many Blood Spirits and this was his lair. There shouldn’t be only one Calamity-grade creature guarding it.</p>
<p>I remember now. It’s said that King Xia of the Yu Dynasty moved the capital out of Yang City. Could it be that the other eight tripod cauldrons were also moved away? Only this tripod cauldron and a guarding Kui were left behind? Zhou Wen guessed as he reached out to touch the bronze tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the bronze tripod was a Nine Province Tripod, it was definitely extraordinary for it to appear in such a place and be consecrated in the stone temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully touched the bronze tripod cauldron, but when his fingertip reached it, he didn’t touch anything. His fingertip went through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he realized what was happening. He extended his hand and touched the bronze tripod cauldron a few more times, but the bronze tripod cauldron was like a phantom. He swept his arm randomly, but he couldn’t touch it at all.</p>
<p>This bronze tripod cauldron is likely the same as the Fire God Platform’s stone saber. Only in reality can I touch it. Zhou Wen looked at the bronze tripod cauldron with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen a few similar things before. They were all extraordinary things. Even The Thearch wanted the stone saber on Fire God Platform. Unfortunately, no one could pull it out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only pull out the stone saber after cultivating the Human Sovereign Sutra. Without cultivating the Human Sovereign Sutra, no matter how strong he was, it was impossible for him to pull it out.</p>
<p>Although I know that these things are treasures, they should be things that hold down a dimensional zone. If I really take them away, I’m afraid it will immediately cause chaos, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>He even wondered that if he really took away the bronze tripod cauldron, would the blood bone temples in Yang City result in the revival of real Classic of Mountains and Seas creatures? If that was the case, anyone would die upon contact. Ignoring Luoyang, the entire Federation would be doomed.</p>
<p>A real Classic of Mountains and Seas creature was definitely not something those Blood Spirits could compare with.</p>
<p>Forget it. It’s best I don’t cause trouble. Zhou Wen gave up on the idea of heading to Yang City in real life to retrieve the tripod cauldron. He circled the stone temple a few more times and didn’t find anything good. All he could do was leave Yang City and continue grinding other dungeons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a hall in the Holy Land, many Saints knelt on the ground. On the throne in the hall sat a figure wearing holy armor. Holy light surrounded him, making him look like a holy god.</p>
<p>However, the helmet and visor covered his face, preventing anyone from seeing his face. They could only sense his holiness and strength, making them involuntarily prostrate themselves in worship.</p>
<p>“The Venusian Companion Beast must belong to the Holy Land. Who is willing to bring it back?” the holy powerhouse swept his gaze at the Saints and said indifferently.</p>
<p>“We are willing to go.” All the Saints looked up and requested to be deployed. Only one Saint remained kneeling there with his head lowered without a word.</p>
<p>“Xiao, are you unwilling?” Holy God’s gaze landed on the Saint as he asked with interest.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m unwilling, but I’m unable to do so.” Xiao had his head lowered, but his tone was neither obsequious nor supercilious.</p>
<p>“If I say you can, you can.” Holy God got up and walked down the jade platform. He came in front of Xiao and extended his right palm. He placed it in front of Xiao and said, “Do you believe me?”</p>
<p>“I believe you.” Xiao looked up with a firm gaze. He extended his right hand and placed it on Holy God’s palm.</p>
<p>A strange light rose between their palms.</p>

<p>Zhou Wen held a metal ball in his hand and was taking pictures with his phone.</p>
<p>This metal ball was a reward that flew out of the Golden Palace after he cleared the Venusian dimensional zone. It was said to be a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen attempted to hatch it, there was no reaction at all. He used his phone to snap a picture, but there was no reaction. He couldn’t store it in-game, nor could he see its information.</p>
<p>Is this thing really a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>However, it was said that every creature that cleared the dungeon obtained a metal ball. Only the metal ball obtained by the final victor was the Venusian Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Although the other metal balls would also hatch Companion Beasts, there was no guarantee of their levels and qualities. They might have decent levels, but they might also be very low-level Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>If this is really a Companion Egg, it’s impossible for the mysterious phone to not react to it. Furthermore, it was obtained from getting first place. It’s just the difference in order. It should be difficult for Venus to tell who will get first in the end. It so happens that I can give him the Venusian Companion Egg… After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that the metal ball was likely not a Companion Egg but a carrier. Only when it determined who was first would Venus inject the true strongest Companion Beast into one of the metal balls.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess.</p>
<p>After putting away the metal ball, Zhou Wen was about to grind when he suddenly felt a strange heat coming from his body. After carefully sensing it, he realized that the heat was from Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Tai Sui has advanced? Zhou Wen was delighted. On careful look, it had indeed completed its evolution.</p>
<p>Using his phone to look at Tai Sui’s information, it had advanced to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Tai Sui: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Clashing Tai Sui</p>
<p>Life Soul: Twelve Tai Sui Gods</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Longevity Seed</p>
<p>Terror Form: Tai Sui God</p>
<p>Strength: 82</p>
<p>Speed: 82</p>
<p>Constitution: 82</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 82</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Earth Escape</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mimicry</p>
<p>Apart from another Terror transformation, there didn’t seem to be much of a change.</p>
<p>When he summoned Tai Sui, it was still white and tender. It was like a white rubber ball as it rolled around on the ground and bounced around. People who didn’t know better would think that it was a toy ball for children. They would never expect it to be a Terror-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Tai Sui’s defense isn’t bad and its self-healing ability is excellent, but its offensive strength is too weak. Apart from having a strong restraining effect on microorganisms, it doesn’t have much lethality against slightly bigger creatures. Could this Tai Sui God skill be targeted at microorganisms? Zhou Wen ordered Tai Sui to use its Terror transformation ability.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what was different about the Terror-form Tai Sui, he saw its body emit a golden glow.</p>
<p>How blinding! Even Zhou Wen had no choice but to cover his eyes with his hand. The light was just too blinding.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, From the looks of it, Tai Sui will undergo a huge change after it transforms into its Terror form. Don’t tell me it will directly take human form? What will it look like if it transforms into a human form? From its original appearance, it should look fair and chubby when it transforms into a human. Perhaps it’s a fatty… That’s not right. Its Terror transformation is Tai Sui God. To be called a god, it should be an extremely mighty existence, right? From the golden light, it might be a handsome god in golden armor…</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, the golden light over Tai Sui’s body gradually dimmed. Soon, it completely vanished, revealing Tai Sui’s true body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and nearly vomited blood. Tai Sui was still as white and fat as before. Ignoring the fact that it hadn’t transformed into a human, its size hadn’t changed at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled Tai Sui a few times before finally discovering a golden symbol on its body. Zhou Wen didn’t recognize the symbol. It felt like a musical note, but it wasn’t completely the same.</p>
<p>Attack! After entering Chess Mountain’s instance dungeon, Zhou Wen got Tai Sui to attack. He wanted to see what changes there would be after the Terror transformation.</p>
<p>Although its appearance hadn’t changed much, it might have become very powerful internally. The golden symbol might be able to shoot out terrifying lasers or something.</p>
<p>Upon receiving Zhou Wen’s order, Tai Sui immediately jumped up with all its might and charged at the group of fake immortals in Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Tai Sui bounced off the fake immortals one by one with great might. Its speed was really fast. It bounced several times on each fake immortal like it was a billiard ball.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched Tai Sui bounce back as the fake immortals stood there motionless. He thought to himself, Could it be that Tai Sui has gained a strange offensive power after advancing? It can kill others in bizarre ways. They will be killed as long as they touch it? In that case, I’ve made a killing.</p>
<p>As he was in thought, the fake immortals suddenly moved. They weren’t dead at all.</p>
<p>Not only did they not die, but they also became even more ferocious. They cried out as though they had gone berserk and charged at Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>One of the fake immortals kicked Tai Sui away.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t… What the hell… Not only has it not become stronger… Why do I feel like it has become weaker… Those fake immortals are only fox demons or chicken spirits. They are at most at the Mythical stage… Zhou Wen nearly blew a gasket.</p>
<p>He originally hoped that Tai Sui could undergo a qualitative transformation after advancing to the Terror grade and become an important combat force for him, but to his surprise, this fellow became weaker after the evolution. He couldn’t even defeat some ordinary lesser demons.</p>
<p>Great! Zhou Wen killed the fake immortals in Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still discovered some problems. The combat strength of these fake immortals seemed to be much stronger than before. This was new.</p>
<p>Could it be that Tai Sui’s Terror transformation has the effect of augmenting one’s combat strength? But why would this effect augment the enemy? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although Tai Sui’s offensive strength wasn’t very good, its body was indeed top-notch at the Terror grade. It wasn’t injured at all after being kicked out. It quickly bounced back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to touch Tai Sui, hoping to see if it really had the ability to enhance one’s combat strength. If it could enhance one’s combat strength, it would make for very good support.</p>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar touched Tai Sui, it immediately felt a strange force augment its body. The feeling was indescribable as though a god had possessed it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to charge into Deer Terrace Pavilion and casually killed the group of fake immortals, Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit, and Lute Spirit. He felt that his Speed, Strength, and other aspects had been greatly augmented. Even his skills had become ferocious, making him twice as strong as usual.</p>
<p>Tai Sui’s ability actually augments every aspect.. That’s very powerful! Zhou Wen went from sadness to joy as he couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1414'>Chapter 1414: Tai Sui Symbol</h3>

<p>Tai Sui’s ability can enhance skills and even Terror transformation abilities. Even Companion Beast equipment on me has been augmented. Under such circumstances, my Speed and Strength are comparable to a Calamity-grade. Can I use Tai Sui’s strength to kill the Venusian Calamity? Zhou Wen felt that he was really about to take off and soar.</p>
<p>With Tai Sui’s powerful augmentation ability, he could fight a Calamity-grade creature head-on. He might not be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of Tai Sui and The Disqualified, Zhou Wen could even instant transmit seamlessly. The chances of finding the Calamity creature in the Venusian instance dungeon were much higher.</p>
<p>The so-called seamless instant transmission was actually a skill that had virtually zero casting time. By continuously instant transmitting, he could almost constantly be in a state of instant transmission. It was impossible for others to attack Zhou Wen as they couldn’t lock onto his location or even see him.</p>
<p>If the Calamity creature couldn’t see him and he could quickly instant transmit to find the target, there was a high chance of finding the Calamity creature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen had just grinded the Venusian instance dungeon and ended up dying. All he could do was wait for the Venusian instance dungeon to respawn tomorrow.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“My dear Tai Sui, you’re really outstanding.” Zhou Wen raised the fair and fat Tai Sui and felt blissful. With Tai Sui by his side, he really didn’t think much of ordinary Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>To be safe, Zhou Wen led Tai Sui into Deer Terrace Pavilion again. He wanted to try a few more times to prevent any miscalculations.</p>
<p>Tai Sui’s ability was really impressive. Zhou Wen killed all the way. The Terror-grade creature that he needed to expend some effort to kill was instantly killed. The thrill left Zhou Wen somewhat mesmerized.</p>
<p>However, when he came to the four generals of the Mo family and activated them, even with Tai Sui’s augmentation, the blood-colored avatar was quickly killed.</p>
<p>Although he had the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation protecting him, after the four statues were activated, thousands of pearl beads shot out from the umbrella the Demonized General opened like a vortex, filling the entire space. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was actually affected and couldn’t circulate normally.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen was ganked and killed. These four fellows were all Calamity-grade existences, and they were top-notch ones. Any one of them had very special abilities that made Zhou Wen envious. He wished he could kill them all and have Companion Eggs drop.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder The Thearch got me to steal the pearl instead. These four fellows are indeed ferocious. Zhou Wen had previously stolen the beads from the umbrella. Back then, he didn’t know that they were so ferocious.</p>
<p>He couldn’t defeat the four generals of the Mo family for the time being, but Zhou Wen didn’t have any intention of targeting them. He still focused on killing the Calamity creature on Venus.</p>
<p>As long as he could kill the Calamity creature, a Calamity Companion Beast would drop sooner or later. When the time came, with the sure-kill seventh bullet, he could sneak an attack on the four Mo family generals from afar.</p>
<p>As long as I obtain the Companion Beast on Venus, it will be much easier to kill a Calamity creature. Although Zhou Wen also had his sights on the Kui, nothing dropped.</p>
<p>After respawning, Zhou Wen grinded other dungeons before sleeping. When he woke up, the Venusian instance dungeon had already refreshed.</p>
<p>After killing me so many times, it’s time for me to kill him. Zhou Wen led Tai Sui into the Venusian instance dungeon and made it undergo Terror transformation.</p>
<p>As a golden light flashed, Tai Sui entered a Terror state as the golden symbol appeared on its body.</p>
<p>Filled with confidence, Zhou Wen wiped out the Metal Guards with a wave of his hand. He wasn’t in a rush to use the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. After all, with Tai Sui’s augmentation, he could set it up almost instantly. There was no need to prepare in advance. This was what Zhou Wen was most satisfied with.</p>
<p>When the Golden Battle God appeared, Zhou Wen wanted to kill it with a wave of his hand, but he suddenly felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention due to his excitement. Now that he had summoned Sword Pill to kill the Golden Battle God, he realized that his summoning speed was much slower.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God’s bullet shot out. Zhou Wen wanted to dodge, but his actions were much slower. He failed to dodge and was hit by the bullet.</p>
<p>What was even more unbelievable was that with his physique, it was fine even if he took a shot head-on. It was impossible for the freezing bullet to freeze his body.</p>
<p>However, when the freezing bullet struck the blood-colored avatar, it froze his body, preventing him from moving.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God continued firing as freezing bullets struck the blood-colored avatar’s body. Finally, the blood-colored avatar’s body shattered into pieces as the game screen went black.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he felt extremely humiliated.</p>
<p>He could kill the Golden Battle God even before he advanced to the Terror grade. Now that he had advanced to the Terror grade, he had been killed by the Golden Battle God. It was a great humiliation.</p>
<p>Tai Sui… is problematic… Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive. He launched the game again and carefully looked at Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that after Tai Sui transformed into its Terror form, the golden symbol on its body was different from yesterday’s. It looked very similar, but it was indeed different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few more times and indeed, he realized that the problem was with Tai Sui. After touching it, not only was he not augmented, but his body was greatly weakened. In a head-on clash, he couldn’t even defeat ordinary Terror-grade creatures.</p>
<p>He got Tai Sui to exit its Terror form before using it again. This time, there was no golden light, and it was the same symbol.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied it for a long time before finally discovering that the symbol on Tai Sui wasn’t fixed. After twenty-four hours, the symbol on Tai Sui changed when it used the Terror transformation ability again.</p>
<p>The symbol that appeared this time was different from the previous two times. After Zhou Wen touched them, he wasn’t augmented or weakened. However, no matter what dimensional creature he killed, none of them dropped dimensional crystals, much less Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>“Bro, are you kidding me? Tell me honestly. How many of those crappy symbols do you have? Quickly give me the first one,” Zhou Wen threatened Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Tai Sui continued bouncing around, unable to understand Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was exasperated. Before figuring out how many symbols Tai Sui had and what effects came with each symbol, he didn’t dare touch them.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was studying Tai Sui, the Cube lit up again. The scene of Venus appeared as someone challenged the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>This time, it was really a person. Zhou Wen immediately recognized the person when he saw him. It was Saint Xiao, but the present Xiao seemed to be different from the Xiao he had seen previously.</p>
<p>Xiao emitted a holy aura, as though he was a saint who had just had his soul cleansed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1415'>Chapter 1415: Unique</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Xiao is the representative of the Holy Land. Since he’s appearing in the Venusian dimensional zone, he will definitely be able to clear it. However, I wonder what method he will use. Zhou Wen guessed how Xiao would clear the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>In theory, Xiao was only at the Terror grade. Only by using some special techniques could he clear the level.</p>
<p>However, the Holy Land was not to be trifled with. It was the only place on Earth that wasn’t bound by Earth’s rules. The powerhouses of the dimension could freely control their powers there.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t dare leave the Holy Land, the help they could give the saints was beyond what the typical person could imagine.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. The various factions were also paying attention to every move the Holy Land made.</p>
<p>After all, the Holy Land was the first faction to rule Earth. Although the six families’ overt opposition and open strife made the Holy Land lose absolute control of Earth, no one dared to underestimate the Holy Land’s influence on Earth.</p>
<p>The six families that had gradually escaped the Holy Land’s control still didn’t dare to openly say that they had betrayed the Holy Land. From this, one could tell how terrifying the Holy Land was.</p>
<p>Now, everyone wanted to know how much strength and influence the Holy Land had on Earth without the support of the six families.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, Xiao entered the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The Metal Guard that appeared in the beginning was naturally nothing to a powerhouse at Xiao’s level. No one believed that the Metal Guard could deal any damage to Xiao. What people really wanted to see was how Xiao could fend off the Calamity-grade bullet.</p>
<p>However, what happened next surprised many people.</p>
<p>The Metal Guard didn’t attack Xiao. It seemed to stand there in a daze.</p>
<p>Xiao watched as the Metal Guard did nothing, but the Metal Guard suddenly aimed its gun at itself.</p>
<p>Da! Da! Da! Da!</p>
<p>The Metal Guard riddled its body with holes.</p>
<p>“Body control or mind control?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>“The Metal Guard’s body didn’t look like it was under control. It’s more likely to be a mind-control technique,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>“No.” An Sheng shook his head with a bitter smile. “Let’s watch and see. Perhaps we can find some clues.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu and Zhang Yuzhi from the Zhang family were also discussing this problem, but they didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p>In fact, the various factions were also studying and analyzing the situation, but they had no results.</p>
<p>Hordes of Metal Guards rushed out, but they only rushed out without shooting at Xiao.</p>
<p>Following that, the Metal Guards raised their guns and aimed them at themselves. Soon, they succeeded in killing themselves and dropped metal fragments on the ground.</p>
<p>After the Golden Battle Gods rushed out, Zhou Wen originally imagined that Xiao wouldn’t clear them so easily, but the Golden Battle Gods raised their guns and committed suicide once again.</p>
<p>The entire Federation was in an uproar.</p>
<p>“Who is this person? Why haven’t I seen him before? He’s just too powerful.”</p>
<p>“This is sick. His opponent committed suicide without him even moving his hand. Is he a god?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, he seems to be stronger than Immortal, Tsukuyomi, and Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“It’s still too early to say that he’s strong. It’s nothing to make the Golden Battle God commit suicide. It will be truly impressive if he can make that Calamity-grade creature commit suicide.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. The typical citizen only knew that Xiao showed a strong performance, but no one could tell how strong he was.</p>
<p>However, when the various factions saw the Golden Battle Gods commit suicide, they jumped in fright. Their expressions turned nasty.</p>
<p>Those who were truly knowledgeable were alarmed at the strength that could make Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods commit suicide.</p>
<p>One had to realize that other than Immortal, the strongest combat strength among humans now was at the Terror grade. If Terror-grade creatures would commit suicide when they saw Xiao, Xiao alone could probably destroy all the factions.</p>
<p>“He can’t be that strong, right? There must be a limit,” Xia Xuanyue said as she looked at the Cube’s screen in surprise.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t seem to have any restrictions.” Xia Liuchuan also frowned.</p>
<p>Now, the Holy Land’s control over the various families was weakening. It wasn’t just the Xia family. The six families were deliberately or unintentionally trying to completely escape the Holy Land’s control over them.</p>
<p>However, after seeing Xiao’s performance today, the fear in their hearts deepened.</p>
<p>Like the Metal Guards from before, all six Golden Battle Gods committed suicide. None of the Golden Battle Gods shot at Xiao. Their bullets were aimed at themselves.</p>
<p>The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time, snapping the bewildered people back to their senses. They stared at Xiao, wondering if Xiao’s power was effective against the Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>Xiao walked towards the door leading to the tunnel as though he hadn’t heard the alarms.</p>
<p>He didn’t walk quickly, as though he was taking a stroll. He ignored the ear-piercing alarm.</p>
<p>Everyone’s hearts pounded with his footsteps. Soon, they were alarmed to discover that Xiao had already walked into the tunnel, but they didn’t hear any gunshots.</p>
<p>No way… Even a Calamity-grade creature can be affected… Zhou Wen’s expression changed.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how Xiao had done it, but from the looks of it, Xiao was really terrifying.</p>
<p>And he was undoubtedly Xiao’s enemy. If Xiao came knocking on his door that very moment, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he could withstand Xiao’s power.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t withstand it, he would commit suicide like the Golden Battle Gods. When that happened, that was it.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu’s expression turned abnormally solemn. Xia Liuchuan stood up and stared at the Cube’s screen without saying a word. However, his brows were furrowed.</p>
<p>Xiao was still walking in the direction of the Golden Palace. Every step he took made everyone’s hearts beat as though they were silently keeping pace with his steps.</p>
<p>Many people were looking forward to the gunshot, but they didn’t hear any even when Xiao reached the Golden Palace’s entrance.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door opened as a metal ball flew out and landed in Xiao’s hand.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen returned to the rankings. The words ‘Saint Xiao’ appeared at the top of the rankings, outranking Zhou Wen who had only been first for a short period of time.</p>
<p>“Ah! I thought that the maximum would only be five stars. Why are there six stars!?”</p>
<p>People were surprised to discover that behind the words “Saint Xiao,” there were six golden stars.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it was Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen, The Fallen, or Immortal, the most they received was five stars via using all sorts of methods to clear the level. Therefore, people felt that the maximum was five stars.</p>
<p>However, the six golden stars behind ‘Saint Xiao’ clearly told everyone that five stars wasn’t the limit, and he was the only existence with such an achievement.</p>
<p>Everyone’s expression, including Zhou Wen’s, turned solemn as they looked at Xiao’s name on the rankings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1416'>Chapter 1416: Doing Something For All Life</h3>
<p>Six stars. I wonder if that Calamity-grade gunman is dead. I didn’t hear any gunshots. He probably isn’t dead. If I kill the Calamity-grade gunman, I should have a chance of exceeding six stars, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>If other humans had obtained first place, Zhou Wen wouldn’t put in so much effort. However, it was intolerable for someone from the Holy Land to obtain first place.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was more vexed about how to find the Calamity-grade gunman.</p>
<p>Killing him was unlikely to be difficult. The difficult part was finding him. Zhou Wen had tried many times and tried all sorts of methods, but he failed to find him.</p>
<p>That Calamity-grade gunman might very well have an invisibility ability like the Invisibility Cloak. Furthermore, it’s high-level invisibility. Otherwise, it shouldn’t be able to escape Truth Listener’s notice, or perhaps it’s some concealment ability. After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a way to find the Calamity-grade gunman.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Federation, people were discussing Xiao’s domineering ascension to the apex. After all, he was the only six-star. It rekindled their curiosity and anticipation for the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“These people are really easily incited. Yesterday, they swore that they would learn from you and raise Companion Beasts, but today, they are all thinking of joining the Holy Land,” Li Xuan came to Zhou Wen and sat on his couch as he gloated.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Isn’t that what humans are? It’s very easy to abandon things like faith, bottom lines, and morals that don’t benefit them.”</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, don’t tar everyone with the same brush. I’m a person with morals and a bottom line. I’m different from ordinary people,” Li Xuan immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“That’s only because you haven’t received enough benefits. It’s hard to say how you would choose if I gave you enough benefits,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, you are doubting my character. Nothing can shake my bottom line,” Li Xuan said righteously.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then if your brother is severely injured and will definitely die, but you realize that killing someone who has some grudge with you despite not deserving death will allow your brother to completely recover. Will you kill him?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“About that…” Li Xuan was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>“Another example is the instance where everyone in your Li family has fallen into the hands of a serial killer. If you don’t help him steal something, he will kill your entire family. Will you carry out the theft?” An Sheng asked again.</p>
<p>“I say, Brother Sheng, can you not curse me? Can’t you think of something better?” Li Xuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“I can come up with positive ones, but your enemy won’t. The so-called beliefs and morals of a human are relative. Therefore, if you want to have a moral bottom line, you have to do and think more than others. Don’t give yourself the chance to cross your moral bottom line. What’s that saying again? If you want to be a clean official, you have to be more sinister than a corrupted official.” An Sheng paused before continuing, “Of course, there are also people who can maintain their beliefs and bottom lines under any circumstances, but I think there are very few saints. It’s best if we ordinary people don’t let ourselves fall into such a situation, nor do we test the bottom lines of others.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense. Brother Sheng, let me toast you.” Li Xuan seemed to agree with An Sheng as he poured him a cup and clinked it with his.</p>
<p>“What are the two of you up to?” Zhou Wen looked at the two of them and asked with a frown.</p>
<p>The two of them had been sitting at his place for a long time and were mentioning things that seemed to imply something. He didn’t know what they were up to.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Isn’t this just a casual chat?” Li Xuan smiled and continued asking, “Old Zhou, do you have plans on getting first place again?”</p>
<p>“The reason that the two of you have been talking all this while is so that I’ll challenge the level again?” Zhou Wen seemed to understand.</p>
<p>An Sheng sighed and said, “Humans are selfish creatures. Previously, there was Immortal from the League of Guardians, and now there’s Xiao from the Holy Land. If this continues, I’m afraid everyone will want to join the Holy Land to contract Guardians in the future. Who will take the difficult path? At this moment, someone has to step forward and attract them back.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have what it takes. Find someone else,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>He really had no solution. If he couldn’t find the Calamity gunner, he would at most obtain five stars like the last time. It was impossible for him to obtain six stars.</p>
<p>“You might not be able to do so, but Human Sovereign definitely can,” An Sheng said with a wink.</p>
<p>“Even Human Sovereign won’t be able to do it this time.” Immortal Culling Sword was indeed very strong, but without finding the Calamity-grade gunman, it was useless no matter how strong it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly sized up Li Xuan and said, “That’s strange. I can understand why Ah Sheng wants me to get first. Why do you want me to get first?”</p>
<p>“Hey, what kind of person do you think I am? I’m also a nice guy. I also want to do something for all life in the world,” Li Xuan said stubbornly.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. This isn’t like you. There’s definitely something going on here.” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan, giving him the creeps.</p>
<p>“Stop staring at me like that. It’s terrifying. I really want to do something good for all life in the world. However, I also want to earn some pocket money.” Unable to withstand Zhou Wen’s questioning gaze, Li Xuan revealed his intentions.</p>
<p>“Pocket money? What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Realizing that he couldn’t hide it, Li Xuan could only say, “Actually, it’s nothing. Someone made a bet on who will take first on the Cube. I placed a heavy bet on you. No, on Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“You want me to risk my life just for that bit of money? Are you even human?” Zhou Wen cursed.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just a bit of money. After Xiao’s recent appearance, the odds for others have increased significantly, especially those who haven’t been on the rankings. Human Sovereign is one of them. If Human Sovereign takes first place in the end, I’ll be able to obtain a large sum of resources. Take note, it’s resources, not money. They are paying with resources, paying whatever is bet,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“You dare buy into such a bet? Aren’t you afraid that they will abscond with the money?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“They won’t run. The Family Clan of Gods is the bookmaker.” Li Xuan was very certain.</p>
<p>“You bought in too?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng.</p>
<p>“I bought a little,” An Sheng said shyly.</p>
<p>“How much is a little?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“500 tonnes of Essence Crystals,” An Sheng answered.</p>
<p>“You call that a little?” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. 500 tonnes of Essence Crystals was probably the total amount of Essence Crystals Luoyang had on hand.</p>
<p>Although the Butterfly Valley where Master Zhuang’s Tomb was located had Essence Crystal ores, there was no way to mine them. People could only enter at specific times. Therefore, they had yet to obtain any Essence Crystals from there.</p>
<p>“I really have no means of getting first place now. Good luck to both of you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t have the means. We do,” Li Xuan suddenly said.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1417'>Chapter 1417: He Who Must Not Be Named</h3>

<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What means do you have?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and An Sheng in puzzlement. Clearly, the two of them had discussed it beforehand.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “Actually, our family has been researching ways to clear the level. We have come up with a few solutions, but the requirements are too high. No one in our family can meet such high requirements, but it would be different if it were you.”</p>
<p>“What solution?” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to beat around the bush with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Li Xuan finally said straightforwardly, “You can fend off the Calamity bullet and have enough strength to kill the Calamity creature. Based on our family’s judgment, the Calamity gunner’s flesh shouldn’t be too strong, so you already have the basic conditions to kill him. Although Xiao is very strong, he failed to kill the Calamity gunner after all. You can, so you have a chance to surpass him and obtain first place.”</p>
<p>“The family you are talking about is your brother, Li Mobai, right? He sure is scheming. He wants me to risk my life while he benefits in the comforts of his home.” Zhou Wen glared at Li Xuan and said, “Go back and tell your brother not to fantasize. If I could kill that Calamity gunner, I would have done so a long time ago. Would he even be able to take advantage of me?”</p>
<p>“Listen to me. It’s true that you are capable, but you can’t find the Calamity gunner, right? Li Mobai has a solution that you can use to find it,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“He has a solution? What solution does he have? He hasn’t even been to the Venusian dimensional zone and knows how to find that Calamity gunner? Don’t tell me he’s trying to scam me?” Zhou Wen refused to believe it.</p>
<p>He had been grinding the Venusian domain for so long, but he hadn’t been able to find the Calamity gunner. He really didn’t believe that Li Mobai, who didn’t even dare enter the Venusian dimensional zone, could tell where it was.</p>
<p>“You also know that my relationship with Li Mobai isn’t good. How can I help him scam you? This time, he really has a way to get you to find the Calamity gunner. Trust me. Go meet him and hear what he has to say. If you think it’s infeasible, it won’t be too late to reject him when the time comes.” Li Xuan seemed very confident in Li Mobai’s method.</p>
<p>“You also believe in Li Mobai?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.</p>
<p>An Sheng shook his head and said, “I don’t believe Li Mobai. I only believe in Overseer. Overseer sent a message asking me to cooperate with Li Mobai.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure it’s news from An Tianzuo?” Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>“There’s no mistake about it.” An Sheng was very certain.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. He seemed to realize something, but he couldn’t connect the dots.</p>
<p>Although Li Mobai re-cultivated after the problem with his body, it will definitely take a lot of time. He won’t be able to catch up so quickly. With his eyesight, it’s hard to say if he can see the Calamity-grade figure. Furthermore, finding a Calamity-grade that’s good at hiding definitely isn’t something he can do.</p>
<p>Besides, why would An Tianzuo want to cooperate with Li Mobai? An Tianzuo should be in the Holy Land now. Why would he be in contact with Li Mobai?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen combed through his thoughts for a while before his heart suddenly stirred. I get it. If all of these things are valid, there’s definitely a missing link. This link might be something or a person. If An Tianzuo discovers the location of the Calamity gunner, he should have directly informed An Sheng without needing to cooperate with Li Mobai. In that case, it’s very likely that the Li family discovered the location of the Calamity gunner, but it’s unlikely that Li Mobai has such eyesight, nor can he be in contact with An Tianzuo while he’s inside the Holy Land. The remaining possibility is that the Li family has someone in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and An Sheng thoughtfully. He didn’t believe that Li Xuan and An Sheng hadn’t thought of this. They had figured it out, but they kept mum. This could only mean that this person’s identity was very important. They were afraid that the Holy Land would catch wind of him, so they couldn’t even say it out loud. They could only use this hint to let Zhou Wen know of his existence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen exchanged looks with An Sheng before saying, “In that case, let me meet Li Mobai first.”</p>
<p>“He’s already waiting outside the manor. I’ll invite him in.” Li Xuan ran out.</p>
<p>“Young Master, safety first. These were the last words Overseer sent back,” An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It must be very difficult to send a message from the Holy Land, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “Every Saint has a special power. Their every word and action, even if it’s something related to them, or even just mentioning them might be sensed by the terrifying existences in the Holy Land. However, the further away they are from the Holy Land, the less effective this power is.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that his guess was right. He probably couldn’t even say the person’s name, so it was best not to mention it. That meant that he was likely one of the Saints. Furthermore, he was the real deal, not an imposter like An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“If there really is such a power, wouldn’t An Tianzuo be easily discovered?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Young Master, don’t worry. Overseer has used a special method to successfully infiltrate the Holy Land. There’s no danger for the time being.” An Sheng was about to say something when a voice sounded from outside. It was Li Xuan and Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“Even if Overseer says that the Li family can be trusted, Young Master, you have to make your own judgment. You have to make the decision on what can and cannot be done. Don’t be influenced by anyone. As long as you think there’s a problem, don’t listen to anyone, no matter who says it—including me. Stay true to yourself,” An Sheng whispered the last sentence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. Li Xuan had already led Li Mobai in.</p>
<p>“Can I have a private chat with Zhou Wen?” After Li Mobai entered, his gaze didn’t land on Zhou Wen but on An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Of course.” An Sheng led Li Xuan out and closed the door. He also activated the room’s defense system.</p>
<p>“I never expected to meet you again in such a place,” Li Mobai said with a smile as he sat down on the sofa without standing on ceremony.</p>
<p>“Just get straight to the point.” Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in chatting with Li Mobai.</p>
<p>Li Mobai didn’t mind, but his body gradually changed. His eyes turned whiter and whiter as his black pupils shrank before completely disappearing.</p>
<p>At that moment, Li Mobai’s eyes were white—ghastly white—even more terrifying than a blind person’s eyes.</p>
<p>Mythical Serum? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Li Mobai’s aura was a little strange. It seemed to be the result of advancing through the use of Mythical Serum, but it also seemed different.</p>
<p>“Mythical Serum made from the Calamity-grade creature, Ghost Eyes, in the South District,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“You have the ability to kill a Calamity-grade creature?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“It was slain during its advancement to the Calamity grade. When it was made into Mythical Serum, it could and could not be considered a Calamity-grade creature. I still haven’t been able to completely unleash the power of the Ghost Eyes Mythical Serum. I’m only at the Mythical stage now,” Li Mobai answered.</p>
<p>Li Mobai didn’t claim to be the one killing Ghost Eyes. Zhou Wen could roughly guess that it was likely done by the undercover Saint.</p>
<p>“My Ghost Eyes can help you find the Calamity gunner,” Li Mobai continued.</p>
<p>“You want to clear the level with me?” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai.</p>
<p>“No, from what I’ve reckoned, if two creatures were to challenge the level together, their ratings would be lower than if it was done by one. If you want to surpass Xiao, you can only clear the level alone.” Li Mobai’s answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>“Then how can you help me find that Calamity gunner? Communication with the outside world is impossible after entering the Venusian dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you have to take my eyes with you,” Li Mobai said as he extended his finger and stabbed it into his eyes.. Blood immediately gushed out like a blooming flower.</p>
<p>3</p>
<h3 id='chapter1418'>Chapter 1418: Final Countdown</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen watched helplessly as Li Mobai dug out his eyes and held the crystalline snow-white eyeballs in his palm. His hand was covered in blood, and there were only bloody holes in his eye sockets.</p>
<p>However, Li Mobai’s expression was as calm as ever. It was as though what he had dug out wasn’t his eyes, but something unimportant.</p>
<p>“I haven’t agreed to it, right? Can your eyes be restored?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.</p>
<p>“No, they can’t,” Li Mobai said indifferently. “You will go not because of the eyes in my hand, but because you were going anyway.”</p>
<p>“Is it worth it?” Zhou Wen fell silent for a moment before asking Li Mobai.</p>
<p>Li Mobai was right. He had originally wanted to go, but he hadn’t gone because he couldn’t find the Calamity gunner.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s worth it depends on how you look at it. From my point of view, it’s very worth it.” Li Mobai extended his palm that was holding the two eyeballs in front of Zhou Wen. “It hasn’t been long since I consumed the Ghost God Eyes’ Mythical Serum. I absorbed very little of its energy, and most of the power of the Ghost God Eyes is stored in these eyes. Pure white is the Ghost Eye, and a speck of red is the God Eye. When the Ghost God Eyes touch, it will be difficult for any creatures in a radius of five kilometers to hide. They will definitely be discovered. When the time comes, the Ghost God Eyes will naturally guide you. However, remember that the Ghost God Eyes can only be used once. After using them, the power will erupt wantonly. If you can’t keep it under control, destroy it.”</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand why Li Mobai was doing this. Even if Xiao obtained first place, it wouldn’t affect their Li family. Why was there a need to go all out?</p>
<p>“Because I don’t wish to be forced to cross my bottom line one day. I’m only doing things ahead of time.” Li Mobai got up and left. His words were clearly what Li Xuan and An Sheng had said previously.</p>
<p>The blood in Li Mobai’s eyes had already coagulated and stopped bleeding. However, the lost eyes couldn’t regrow.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk you out.” Zhou Wen held the Ghost Eye and wanted to help Li Mobai guide the way.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I just don’t have eyes,” Li Mobai said indifferently as he walked out of the room.</p>
<p>“Your… Your eyes… What’s going on?” Li Xuan’s expression changed when he saw Li Mobai come out and discovered his bloody eye sockets. He pointed at Li Mobai’s eye sockets and spoke incoherently.</p>
<p>“I gave them to Zhou Wen,” Li Mobai answered as he walked, seemingly unfazed.</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said before. You said that you would challenge the level with Old Zhou…” Li Xuan exclaimed in agitation.</p>
<p>“You’re still so naive. Isn’t it obvious? I lied.” Li Mobai walked towards the door of Overseer Manor without looking back.</p>
<p>Losing his eyes didn’t seem to affect his mobility much, but looking at his straight back, there was a tinge of sadness.</p>
<p>“I… You… I, he… F*ck you…” Li Xuan was filled with hatred as his face contorted. He wanted to curse, but he didn’t know who to curse. Finally, he slapped himself in the face. His face swelled, but his physique instantly healed his face.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. Even without you, a person like him will ultimately do what he wants. No one can stop him.” An Sheng understood Li Xuan’s inner struggle as he patted him on the shoulder to console him.</p>
<p>“I’m heading back.” Li Xuan shook his head and left Overseer Manor dejectedly.</p>
<p>When An Sheng returned to his room, Zhou Wen was holding the pair of Ghost God Eyes.</p>
<p>“Is Li Mobai a friend or foe?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng and asked with an ambivalent expression.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” An Sheng shook his head and smiled bitterly. “I can’t read Li Mobai either. Even Overseer doesn’t dare underestimate him. Young Master, you have to be careful.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and put away the pair of Ghost God Eyes. He had the ability to protect himself, so he could try to see if it was of any use. Even if it was useless, he was more than capable of protecting himself.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on making the trip immediately. He still wanted to wait until the Soul Mirror advanced to the Calamity grade before challenging the level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Li Mobai had also said that Ghost God Eyes could only be used once, but he didn’t need to use it immediately. Zhou Wen needed to choose a suitable opportunity himself.</p>
<p>What is Li Mobai up to? Zhou Wen was extremely puzzled, but he couldn’t figure out the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Wen’s recent observations, the rainbow beam emitted by the Soul Mirror was converging. It was likely about to advance to the Calamity grade. It would definitely advance in a few days at most.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to wait a few days, but after more than a day, he couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>That night, the Cube suddenly lit up. People imagined that someone had entered the Venusian dimensional zone, but when they saw the scene on the Cube, they realized that it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>There were no other creatures on the Cube’s screen. All it showed was a countdown—a 72-hour countdown. Beside it was the rankings.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that this spelled the last 72 hours. The Venusian Companion Beast would choose its owner in 72 hours. And its owner was naturally the person first on the Cube’s rankings.</p>
<p>72 hours. Will the Soul Mirror make it in time? Zhou Wen wasn’t sure. All he could do was wait. If he really couldn’t wait, he could only try his luck with the Ghost God Eyes.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw the scene on the Cube change. It returned to the outside of the Venusian dimensional zone, and a figure was already standing at the entrance. It was none other than The Fallen who had cleared the level and obtained a ranking previously.</p>
<p>The Fallen attempted again. This time, not only did he flip open the black leather-bound book, but the pair of mixed-feathered angel wings on his back also emitted a terrifying glow, making him look like a devil that had descended to the world.</p>
<p>Everything that touched the brilliance instantly turned to dust. Even the Golden Battle Gods were no exception. When the Calamity-grade bullet was still in the air, it had already turned to dust.</p>
<p>The Fallen reduced the seventh sure-kill bullet to dust as he walked into the Golden Palace in an indomitable manner.</p>
<p>However, he only obtained five stars. Although there was an additional star than the last time and he was ranked second, pushing Zhou Wen, Immortal, and Tsukuyomi down, he ultimately failed to obtain six stars.</p>
<p>“Such terrifying power can’t even obtain six stars?”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Xiao’s way too formidable to receive six stars.”</p>
<p>“This time, the Venusian Companion Beast will most likely fall into Xiao’s hands.”</p>
<p>“After all, he comes from the Holy Land. The Holy Land is still strong.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid no one can produce another six-star result.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Even such a powerful Calamity-grade creature couldn’t surpass Xiao’s ranking. From the looks of it, Xiao’s first place was secured.</p>
<p>No one from the humans attempted. Even Immortal didn’t appear. He probably knew that it was very difficult to obtain six stars and it was useless to make the attempt, so he gave up.</p>
<p>Half a day passed. At noon, the Cube finally stirred again. Tsukuyomi’s figure appeared in the Venusian dimensional zone again.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1419'>Chapter 1419: No</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up Tsukuyomi and saw that her aura had become more tranquil and mysterious. It was hazy like moonlight partially veiled by clouds.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t see her clearly, he couldn’t help but be attracted to her. He almost couldn’t move his eyes away from her. The more he couldn’t see her clearly, the more he wanted to.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi seems to have become stronger. Zhou Wen’s present eyesight wasn’t what it used to be. With the augmentation of The Disqualified and the sensual enhancement from Great Brahma, the things he could sense were much stronger than the typical Terror-grade.</p>
<p>It wasn’t much weaker than some Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>Although Tsukuyomi hadn’t used her strength, just the change in her aura made Zhou Wen feel that she had definitely improved significantly.</p>
<p>Strange, how did she improve? What is out there in the universe that allows her to improve? Zhou Wen thought to himself. Up to now, Zhou Wen knew too little about the universe.</p>
<p>Apart from guessing that every planet might be a Companion Egg, the universe was still a mysterious unknown to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Why did the Calamity creatures on Earth head out into the universe the moment they were born? Why was it that a powerful Calamity creature like Tsukuyomi was reverent towards the universe and might even die?</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen still hadn’t figured out the answer to the questions.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi had already entered the Venusian dimensional zone. Before the Metal Guard could shoot at her, its head was suddenly bitten off by a white monster that appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>The monster’s front half looked like a white dog, but its body behind its forelimbs was coiled like a snake’s. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>After it bit off the Metal Guard’s head, it swallowed the Metal Guard’s energy core and vanished. All of this only took a moment.</p>
<p>That’s Inugami from the Ghost Parade, right? Zhou Wen had previously studied the legends of Tsukuyomi and the Ghost Parade, so he knew a lot about the Ghost Parade in Tsukuyomi’s pantheon. He recognized it at a glance.</p>
<p>The six doors opened as hordes of Metal Guards rushed out. However, before they could fire, Inugami’s figure appeared again and bit off the head of a Metal Guard.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t just Inugami who appeared. There was also Hashihime, who Zhou Wen had seen before. She appeared along with a wooden bridge that connected to the door. After the Metal Guards that appeared from the door walked onto the wooden bridge, they seemed to lose their minds. They didn’t shoot as though they were in a daze as they walked towards Hashihime.</p>
<p>Hashihime stood on the bridge, wearing a floral kimono and holding a paper umbrella. Although her face couldn’t be seen due to the umbrella, her beautiful figure was enough to make one fantasize.</p>
<p>When the Metal Guard walked in front of Hashihime, she finally turned her head. The moment she turned her head, the paper umbrella in her hand flew up. Her face was like a ghost’s. She had sharp teeth, blood-red eyes, and sharp claws. Her face was as white as powder, and there were streaks of blood tears around the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the ferocious Hashihime’s body was like a ghost. Wherever her sharp claws and ghastly hands went, she dug out the Metal Guard’s energy sources and crushed them to pieces.</p>
<p>Ghosts appeared and disappeared as hordes of Metal Guards were slaughtered. Tsukuyomi didn’t need to do it herself.</p>
<p>After the Golden Battle God appeared, he couldn’t withstand the attacks of the ghosts. He wanted to shoot, but a phantom-like ghost appeared over him as though it had possessed him. It made the Golden Battle God lose control of his body and he couldn’t pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A ghost with a huge hammer smashed down, cracking the Golden Battle God’s body. The energy source was also shattered.</p>
<p>The six Golden Battle Gods were like six helpless orphans amidst the ghosts that appeared and disappeared from time to time. They were quickly wiped out.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi walked towards the tunnel as ghosts constantly appeared around her, like guards escorting a princess.</p>
<p>Everyone watched with relish. They originally wanted to see how Tsukuyomi would deal with the Calamity-grade bullets. They were not certain that the ghosts could withstand them.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, Tsukuyomi, who was escorted by the hundred ghosts, wasn’t attacked by the Calamity-grade bullets. Even when she came in front of the Golden Palace, not a single bullet appeared.</p>
<p>“Goddess Tsukuyomi is too powerful. Even the Calamity gunner is frightened and doesn’t dare fire.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I wonder if the Cube will give a high or low evaluation?”</p>
<p>“If one doesn’t undergo the test of the Calamity-grade bullets, their score won’t be too high, right?”</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. Goddess Tsukuyomi is invincible. Even the Calamity gunner doesn’t dare fire. How can her score not be high? I think it’s definitely going to be six stars. Furthermore, it will be higher than Xiao’s ranking.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly, but this time, the Golden Palace’s door didn’t open, nor did a metal ball fly out. However, when the Cube’s screen switched back to the rankings, the golden stars behind Tsukuyomi’s name changed from five to six. However, her ranking still failed to surpass Xiao’s. She was only ranked second.</p>
<p>Such powerful strength still isn’t enough to surpass Xiao? Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>He could clearly tell that Tsukuyomi’s ability had increased significantly. Under such circumstances, her failure to surpass Xiao’s ranking meant that Xiao’s strength was even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability to arrive on Venus.</p>
<p>As his teleportation precision was much higher than before, Zhou Wen appeared not far from the Venusian dimensional zone and saw Tsukuyomi who was about to leave.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi also sensed that someone had appeared and turned her head. After discovering that it was Zhou Wen, she stood there and smiled at him. The white-robed Tsukuyomi appeared especially beautiful and ethereal with the dark universe in the background. Her entire body seemed to emit an intoxicating halo.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, can we have a chat?” Zhou Wen went forward and asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Tsukuyomi’s lips curled up slightly as a crafty look appeared in her eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was feeling somewhat depressed when he saw Tsukuyomi walk in front of him. She said with a smile, “It’s boring to just have a chat. Why don’t we do something else?”</p>
<p>With that said, Tsukuyomi extended her slender and fair fingers and pressed them on Zhou Wen’s forehead. Instantly, she vanished with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that his spatial powers were already impressive, but he realized that Tsukuyomi’s spatial powers were even better. During the spatial teleportation, Zhou Wen almost didn’t sense the fluctuations and vibrations brought about by spatial teleportation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1420'>Chapter 1420: Cruel Universe</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen landed on the ground, he felt softness beneath his feet as though he had stepped on something extremely soft. He hurriedly flew up and stabilized himself.</p>
<p>Only then did he look down and see that it was a large asteroid. The shape of the asteroid looked like a bowl held up diagonally. And in the crater, there was a soft bed.</p>
<p>At that moment, Tsukuyomi was already lying on the bed. She was lying diagonally with one hand supporting her cheek as she looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Is this where you live?” Zhou Wen looked around curiously and saw that it was an asteroid belt. There were strange asteroids everywhere.</p>
<p>Apart from Tsukuyomi and this bed, there were no signs of life.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What do you think?” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“The environment’s a little lacking. Why don’t you find a better place?” Just as Zhou Wen said that, Tsukuyomi suddenly flicked her sleeve. The sleeve transformed into a white ribbon that wrapped around Zhou Wen’s body and pulled him down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell onto the bed as his expression changed slightly. He wanted to ask Tsukuyomi what she was doing, but before he could say a word, she leaned against him and covered his mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak.” Tsukuyomi’s pink lips were almost by Zhou Wen’s ear. Her voice was so soft that even Zhou Wen could hardly hear her. Her breath made Zhou Wen’s ears itch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense Tsukuyomi using strength, so he didn’t retaliate. He lay there quietly and used Truth Listener to probe his surroundings.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen discovered a problem. Not far from the asteroid belt was a huge alien beast patrolling the area.</p>
<p>The alien beast’s body was like a stingray, but it was many times bigger than the stingrays on Earth. Furthermore, its entire body was transparent like crystal. There were thin threads that emitted blue light in its body, like a human’s vascular network.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a terrifying aura from the strange creature and immediately held his breath.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare mess around with something that even Tsukuyomi was afraid of.</p>
<p>The alien beast swam through the asteroid belt. There were a few times when it was less than a thousand meters away from the asteroid they were on. Tsukuyomi remained motionless as though she had been petrified. Zhou Wen could only mimic her.</p>
<p>After a while, the alien beast slowly left and vanished into the distant asteroid belt.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Zhou Wen could only sense that it was a dimensional creature, but he didn’t know what kind it was.</p>
<p>“A Calamity-grade creature whose level is much higher than mine. If it discovers us, we might become food.” Tsukuyomi lay diagonally beside Zhou Wen with one hand supporting her cheek. Her other hand was still pressing down on Zhou Wen’s chest as though she had no intention of letting him get up.</p>
<p>“Level?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Although we are both at the Calamity grade, there’s still a difference in strength. There’s a huge difference in strength between levels; the strength of one’s domain will experience a qualitative leap likewise,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“What levels are they?” Zhou Wen hurriedly pressed. He knew too little about the Calamity grade, and he could take this opportunity to understand more. Perhaps he could find a way to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“Human Realm, Hell, and Heaven correspond to three different domains. I’m still at the level of the Human Realm,” Tsukuyomi answered.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any Calamity-grade experts among us humans, right? Why would Calamity-grade levels be named after humans?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>According to what he knew, there didn’t seem to be any pure Calamity-grade humans. Ignoring that, he had never heard of pure Mythical humans either.</p>
<p>“How would I know? This is the division of the Calamity grade according to ancient legends. If you want to know, you can return to countless years ago and find the answer yourself.” Tsukuyomi continued with a smile, “A Calamity creature like me that was just born on Earth doesn’t even count as the Human Realm—a pure Calamity rookie. I’m only at the Human Realm now, but there are Calamity creatures at the Hell and Heaven levels in the universe. The difference is huge.”</p>
<p>“Why are there so many powerful Calamity creatures in the universe?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>“Some of them came from Earth, while others came from other planets,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Just like the dimensional creatures on Venus? However, the dimensional creatures on Venus don’t leave Venus. That so-called Venusian Companion Beast needs to reach a contract with other creatures to leave Venus.” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that so many Calamity-grade creatures had reached a contract.</p>
<p>“It’s not wrong to say that they need to reach a contract, but there are also situations where there’s no need to reach a contract. For example, when a planet’s lifespan reaches its end, which means that the Companion Beasts inside have already grown to their limits. Even if they don’t need to contract with others, they will automatically be released because of the planet’s destruction. That way, the Companion Beasts that appear will become ownerless Companion Beasts. Typically speaking, due to the long period of growth, these Companion Beasts are very powerful. Most of them are at the Heaven level when they are liberated. Of course, there are also planets that are accidentally destroyed before they reach the end of their lifespans. Then, the Companion Beasts produced will be weaker.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Tsukuyomi continued, “Of course, a portion of them are able to come out via reaching contracts. However, only creatures from Earth can contract with Companion Beasts. If those fellows from the dimension want to contract with Companion Beasts in the universe, they need to do it through the bodies of Earthlings.”</p>
<p>“Wait, in other words, that powerful Calamity creature was actually a Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen suddenly came to a realization.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Tsukuyomi nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Then I should be able to contract it, right?” Zhou Wen asked with widened eyes.</p>
<p>If he could contract a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, he would really make a killing.</p>
<p>“Of course. However, such an ownerless Companion Beast is equivalent to a feral beast. It’s different from cats and dogs reared at home. It doesn’t like to be restrained. As long as you aren’t afraid of being killed, you can give it a try.” Tsukuyomi’s finger slid to Zhou Wen’s cheek and pinched his face with her fingers. With a smile, she continued, “You are so thick-skinned. Perhaps those powerful wild Companion Beasts will be moved by your shamelessness. They might really contract with you.”</p>
<p>“Even so, the universe is an excellent place for a Calamity creature born from Earth like you. As long as you can contract a few Companion Beasts, your strength will greatly increase. Why are you so afraid?” Zhou Wen was still somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Even if there were many Calamity-grade creatures in the universe, they wouldn’t hunt other Calamity-grade creatures for no reason, right?</p>
<p>“Do you know how Calamity creatures grow?” Tsukuyomi asked instead of answering.</p>
<p>“I haven’t advanced to the Calamity grade, so I’m not sure.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Ignoring growth, just maintaining one’s existence requires a large amount of energy. The higher one’s level is, the more energy one needs. And the best way to obtain energy is to devour other Calamity creatures.” Tsukuyomi’s words immediately made Zhou Wen understand the cruelty of the universe. The competition for survival was even crueler than Earth’s.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1421'>Chapter 1421: Human Sovereign Attempts the Level</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen chatted with Tsukuyomi for a while and gained a deeper understanding of the dangers of the universe.</p>
<p>Apart from being food for other Calamity creatures, there was the constant danger of Essence Energy expenditure. One needed to constantly replenish their Essence Energy to maintain their combat strength.</p>
<p>If one expended too much energy, it wouldn’t only be a problem of a decline in combat strength. One might even starve to death.</p>
<p>Apart from hunting other Calamity creatures, one could also obtain Essence Energy from dimensional zones on different planets. There was also an important source of Essence Energy—Companion Beasts born on those planets.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen understand that Calamity creatures like Tsukuyomi and The Fallen wanted the Venusian Companion Beast to increase their strength, but also use it as food.</p>
<p>An existence like the Dragon Turtle had risked entry into the dimensional zone because it was starving—typical Essence Energy couldn’t satisfy its survival requirements.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry?” Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi with an odd expression.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi stared at Zhou Wen and suddenly licked her lips. This action gave Zhou Wen a fright as he nearly jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. I still don’t plan on eating you. You’re too thin. I should be fattening you up before I eat you.” Tsukuyomi burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled awkwardly. He also knew that if Tsukuyomi wanted to eat him, she would have done so long ago. There was no need to wait until now to tell him this.</p>
<p>“If you have the need, I can provide you with some Essence Energy Crystals,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Typical Essence Energy Crystals aren’t of much use to Calamity-grade creatures. It doesn’t matter if we eat them or not. I need Calamity-grade Essence Energy Crystals. Do you have them?”</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he looked at Tsukuyomi and said, “You entered the Venusian dimensional zone for the second time and tried your best to obtain a ranking because you wanted to obtain the Venusian Companion Beast as food, right? In that case, you should have reached the point of needing to replenish your Essence Energy, yes?”</p>
<p>“I do need to replenish my Essence Energy, but it looks like it won’t work this time. That Xiao’s strength should be at the Human Realm, but his attributes are very strange. I’m afraid it’s difficult to surpass him,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Apart from the Venusian Companion Beast, is there no other place to replenish Essence Energy?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“You can hunt other dimensional creatures or Companion Beasts. Not all creatures are that strong. There are still some weaker fellows. There are still opportunities,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Can you go to the Moon? If there’s anything you need my help with, go to the Moon to find Lady Supreme Yin,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“There shouldn’t be such a need,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Go if there’s ever such a need.” Zhou Wen got up and said, “I should return. Let’s chat another time if fate allows it.”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen used spatial teleportation to leave, Tsukuyomi licked her lips again and rubbed her stomach with her palm. She muttered to herself, I’m really hungry. I wonder how long I can last.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he planned how to kill the Calamity gunner and clinch first place on the Cube.</p>
<p>Ever since he spoke to Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen realized that a Calamity-grade Companion Beast was good stuff. It could be used for fighting usually and be eaten when one was hungry. It was a necessary divine artifact for traveling.</p>
<p>After he advanced to the Calamity grade, he would definitely need to use them.</p>
<p>There were many resources in the universe that required the strength of a Calamity-grade to vie for them. Otherwise, entering the universe was equivalent to courting death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted the Venusian Companion Egg, but now, he was even more eager to obtain it.</p>
<p>I wonder if Ghost God Eyes can really find the location of the Calamity gunner. If Soul Mirror isn’t done before the countdown ends, I can only give it a try using Ghost God Eyes. Zhou Wen looked at the time. There were still more than fifty hours left on the countdown. He could still afford to wait.</p>
<p>The colorful light from the Soul Mirror weakened, but it didn’t seem like it would completely converge anytime soon.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. No other creature reached six stars. In fact, no other creature challenged the rankings.</p>
<p>When there was only an hour left before the countdown ended and the Soul Mirror still hadn’t completed its evolution, Zhou Wen decided not to wait any longer.</p>
<p>Firstly, he couldn’t wait any longer. Secondly, even if the Soul Mirror advanced to the Calamity grade, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was effective against the Calamity gunner.</p>
<p>After making sufficient preparations, Zhou Wen donned the Prisoned Dragon armor and held the Immortal Culling Sword. In the disguise of Human Sovereign, he arrived at the Venusian dimensional zone again.</p>
<p>Seeing that the countdown was about to end, everyone stared at it.</p>
<p>Now, most people felt that there was no suspense and Xiao would retain first place. After all, it was very difficult to obtain six stars.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, there’s less than an hour left on the countdown. Do you think there will be any surprises or suspense we should expect regarding the Cube’s rankings?” the host asked Professor Gu in the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“There shouldn’t be any surprises…” Before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, he suddenly saw the Cube screen light up. A figure stood in the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>“It’s Human Sovereign! He finally appeared!”</p>
<p>“There’s something wrong with Professor Gu’s mouth, right?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he’s finally here. I thought he didn’t plan on appearing.”</p>
<p>“So what if he’s here? Although Human Sovereign is a little strong, I’m afraid he can’t reach Xiao’s level.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Our Human Sovereign is invincible. Xiao and whatever six-stars are all trash in front of our Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign will definitely win!”</p>
<p>Most humans supported Human Sovereign. Although humans were motivated by self-interest, humans were also sentimental creatures.</p>
<p>Emotionally, most humans still hoped that Human Sovereign would obtain first place, not Saint Xiao, who represented the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“Bro, do you think Human Sovereign has a chance of reaching first place?” Zhang Yuzhi looked at Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult. Even if he’s Human Sovereign, that Xiao’s strength is too powerful and strange. I’m afraid it’s very difficult to surpass him. Zhang Chunqiu knew very well that although Human Sovereign was very strong, he relied on his sword—his body wasn’t at the Calamity grade. It was impossible for him to reach Xiao’s level.</p>
<p>“Sigh, I know it’s very difficult, but I really don’t want the Holy Land to get first,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“No one wishes so, but that’s reality. It won’t change because of our personal feelings.” Zhang Chunqiu stared at Human Sovereign on the screen and said, “But that person… Perhaps a miracle will really happen… After all, he’s Human Sovereign…”</p>
<p>Jiang Yan led the core members of the League of Guardians to gather in front of the Cube. Zhong Ziya sat on the sofa, drinking and listening to the radio.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was in the meeting hall of an office building, watching the livestream with a group of federal officials. His expression was rather solemn.</p>
<p>“This should be the last hope for pure humans, right?” Xia Xuanyue from the Xia family sighed.</p>
<p>“We still don’t know if he’s pure human.” Although Xia Liuchuan said that, he hoped that Human Sovereign could amount to something.. At the very least, he wanted to take the wind out of the fellows from the Holy Land.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1422'>Chapter 1422: Possibility of Six Stars</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored the Metal Guard’s attacks and walked towards the tunnel’s door.</p>
<p>The Metal Guard’s bullets swept across Zhou Wen’s body, but they were blocked by the Prisoned Dragon armor, not even leaving a mark. Instead, the bullets ricocheted from the Prisoned Dragon armor and shattered the Metal Guard’s energy source.</p>
<p>The Metal Guard wasn’t afraid of the bullets, so it was useless even if the bullets riddled its body with holes. However, once the energy source exploded, the Metal Guard was dead.</p>
<p>The six doors opened as hordes of Metal Guards rushed out. Bullets fired at Zhou Wen crazily, but all of them ricocheted from the Prisoned Dragon armor. They all had their energy sources blasted apart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t attack. He only relied on the ricocheting to finish off the Metal Guards.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t as extravagant as the others. He stored the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that the Metal Guards dropped, regardless of whether they were good or bad.</p>
<p>After all, he usually grinded in-game, and he couldn’t take out the things he obtained in-game. If there was a chance to pick up something, he wouldn’t miss it.</p>
<p>“Look at Human Sovereign. He’s already such an invincible powerhouse, yet he’s still so diligent and thrifty. He’s really a perfect man. He will definitely be a good husband in the future. I really want to marry him,” a girl said dreamily as her eyes suffused hearts.</p>
<p>“Cut it out. What thrifty? You just want his body…” the girl beside her curled her lips.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle God appeared and fired, but Zhou Wen still didn’t dodge. He secretly circulated his strength and used the Prisoned Dragon armor’s reflective force to increase the bullet’s strength, causing the bullet to fly back even faster and blast apart the Golden Battle God’s energy source.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that works? Even a Terror-grade Golden Battle God can be ricocheted to death. What armor is that?”</p>
<p>“This reflective ability seems to be even more domineering than the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle from before!”</p>
<p>“As expected of Human Sovereign. He’s too domineering.”</p>
<p>“It’s just this and nothing more. He’s only relying on the Companion Beast armor. Look at how Tsukuyomi and Xiao obtained six stars. They didn’t use any of these ricocheting parlor tricks. It’s all useless.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The six Golden Battle Gods were ricocheted to death one by one, but it wasn’t all thanks to the Prisoned Dragon armor. The force Zhou Wen secretly used was also key. Otherwise, just the ricocheting bullets wouldn’t deliver such a strong effect.</p>
<p>The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time. Everyone immediately focused as they stared intently at Zhou Wen’s figure, hoping to see how he would deal with the Calamity-grade bullets. This was the true crux.</p>
<p>“When Xiao cleared the level, the Calamity-grade gunner didn’t fire. The Calamity-grade gunman didn’t fire for Tsukuyomi either. Only they obtained six stars. The other strong ones like The Fallen failed to obtain six stars. It’s obvious that the key is to prevent the Calamity-grade gunner from firing. If Human Sovereign were to let the Calamity-grade gunman fire a shot, I’m afraid he wouldn’t have a chance to obtain six stars,” Xia Liuchuan analyzed.</p>
<p>“But from the looks of it, Human Sovereign shouldn’t have such an ability. His ability is more reflected in his combat strength. He doesn’t have the ability to make his opponent commit suicide, nor does he have Tsukuyomi’s Ghost Parade ability. It’s probably very difficult to make the Calamity-grade gunner not shoot, right?” Xia Xuanyue said.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult, but it has to be done. It’s not that easy to obtain six stars,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>In fact, there were many people with the same thoughts as Xia Liuchuan. After watching so many attempts, most people had a certain understanding of how the Venusian dimensional zone scored the attempt. How the Calamity-grade gunner was dealt with was key.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, preventing the Calamity-grade gunner from firing was the most effective way to get a high score. There likely wasn’t a better way of obtaining six stars.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Just as people were discussing if Human Sovereign could scare the Calamity-grade gunner into not firing, a gunshot sounded.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the gunshot sounded, the Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand moved, but it didn’t leave its scabbard. All he did was use the hilt of his sword to block the Calamity-grade bullet and change the direction of the bullet.</p>
<p>After the Calamity-grade bullet changed direction and shot elsewhere, Zhou Wen walked over to the tunnel and ventured inside.</p>
<p>Bullets shot over one after another, but Zhou Wen’s arm only moved slightly as he struck the bullets with the hilt. It looked like he was easily changing the direction of the bullets, preventing any of them from hitting him.</p>
<p>It looked easy, but in fact, it wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>To do so, not only did he need to have good eyesight and timing, but he also needed to have sufficient strength and top-notch control over his force. Under the impact of the light-speed bullet, he would ingeniously strike the side of the bullet from a certain angle. By exerting a tiny bit of strength, he could change the direction of the bullet.</p>
<p>“As expected of Human Sovereign. His eyesight, force control, and timing are all top-notch. From the looks of it, he likely hasn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. I’m afraid there aren’t many humans other than Human Sovereign that can accomplish such a feat with Terror-grade strength.” Zhang Chunqiu sighed softly and continued, “Unfortunately, no matter how good his technique is, as long as that Calamity-grade gunner fires, it will be difficult to get a rating of six stars.”</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Zhang Yuzhi still hoped that Human Sovereign could obtain first place.</p>
<p>“Not at the moment.” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.</p>
<p>“There shouldn’t be any suspense. Although Human Sovereign is very strong, he hasn’t advanced to the Calamity grade after all. Without the effects of a domain, he can’t stop the Calamity-grade gunner from firing. It’s impossible for him to reach six stars. If there aren’t any other stronger creatures attempting the level, Xiao should end up in first place,” Professor Gu explained in the program.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, since a powerhouse like Human Sovereign has stood up to the challenge, he definitely has his own ideas. Could he have other tricks up his sleeve?” The host was a fan of Human Sovereign, so she still held onto a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>“There’s always a limit to human strength. It can’t be done if it just can’t be done. No matter how strange a move is, it has to be within a certain set of rules. The Calamity-grade gunner has already fired. The rules governing the Cube’s ratings make it impossible for him to obtain six stars. It’s useless no matter what move he has. Now, Human Sovereign can only vie for third place. If he can surpass The Fallen and obtain third place, he should be able to obtain a good Companion Beast. This isn’t a bad choice. The reason Human Sovereign is here this time is likely to vie for third place. As a Terror-grade, it’s already very impressive to be able to come in at third place. Human Sovereign hasn’t shamed our human pride,” Professor Gu answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“What a pity. Even he can’t shake Xiao’s position,” Cave Era said in disappointment as she looked at the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>“He’s not someone who does things randomly without confidence,” Jiang Yan said indifferently.</p>
<p>In the room, Zhong Ziya, who was hugging his sword and looking a little dazed from drinking, leaned on the sofa. After hearing Professor Gu’s explanation, the corners of his mouth involuntarily curled up as he muttered to himself, “That fellow doesn’t like something like third place.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The seventh gunshot rang.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1423'>Chapter 1423: Only Chance</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>With Zhou Wen using The Disqualified and with the augmentation of Great Brahma and Truth Listener, it was difficult for the Calamity-grade bullet trajectories to escape his notice.</p>
<p>At the instant the seventh sure-kill bullet shot out, Zhou Wen unsheathed the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Immortal Slaying slashed at the tip of the sure-kill bullet with unparalleled sword aura.</p>
<p>Sparks flew as the Immortal Culling Sword cleaved through the sure-kill bullet. The two halves of the bullet flew past Zhou Wen’s body and slammed into the wall before sinking in. It failed to return.</p>
<p>What a powerful attack! Xiao, who was watching the Cube, narrowed his eyes when he saw this scene.</p>
<p>“It’s because that sword is powerful. I heard from Lord Holy God that that sword once killed countless Calamity creatures in the Mythical era. Even the invincible powerhouses at the Apocalypse level are very afraid of it. Thankfully, Human Sovereign only has one. If it’s as Lord Holy God said, with all four swords in his hand, I’m afraid no one on Earth can match him,” a Saint watching the battle said.</p>
<p>“It’s useless no matter how strong that sword is. No matter how strong he is, he can only obtain five stars even if he reaches the Golden Palace now. The Cube’s first place is already Xiao’s,” another Saint said.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily true.” Xiao looked at the scene and whispered in a voice that only he could hear.</p>
<p>This was the first time they had seen the sure-kill bullet being severed. It excited many humans.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is indeed invincible. So what if it’s at the Calamity grade? So what if it’s a sure-kill bullet? Isn’t it still split in one strike?”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Human Sovereign, I want to have children with you.”</p>
<p>“Uncle, stop fooling around!” The young man beside him flushed red as he pulled the man with the beard—the one clamoring to have children with Human Sovereign—out of the crowd.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword had already been sheathed. Zhou Wen continued walking forward—he wasn’t walking very quickly because he needed to determine the gunner’s general location before using Li Mobai’s Ghost God Eyes to ensure the highest success rate.</p>
<p>There was only one chance, so Zhou Wen couldn’t fail.</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought, even if Zhou Wen were to reach the Golden Palace, he would at most be rated five stars. If he couldn’t kill the Calamity gunner, it would be impossible for him to obtain a six-star rating.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly sent the Calamity-grade gunner’s bullets flying as he searched for his location.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already tried many times in-game, but every time he felt that his judgment was right, the Calamity-grade gunner would be gone when he instant transmit over to where he should be. He couldn’t sense the location of the Calamity-grade gunner at all.</p>
<p>However, from the direction of the bullet, the Calamity-grade gunner was definitely there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also attempted to attack the spot he had determined regardless of whether he could see it or not, but it was useless. His attack didn’t touch anything and it only slammed into the wall.</p>
<p>“What a pity. If such a human powerhouse can advance to the Calamity grade, people like Xiao and Tsukuyomi might not be able to compete with him,” said Worm Dugu with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I still don’t know if he’s pure human. If he advances to the Calamity grade, it might not be a good thing for humanity.” Dugu Ge’s expression was ambivalent.</p>
<p>Now, the various factions knew very well that if Human Sovereign was really pure human, it would undoubtedly be a potent stimulant for the Federation and humanity. It was very likely to make humans regain the confidence and pride they had long lost.</p>
<p>However, if Human Sovereign wasn’t pure human, it was very likely that the last bit of humanity’s beliefs would be crushed.</p>
<p>In the entire Federation, there were quite a number of human powerhouses, but there really weren’t many pure humans. Only Zhou Wen could enter the rankings, but Zhou Wen virtually relied on Companion Beasts. Furthermore, there was the suspicion that he resorted to trickery. It made people feel that he wasn’t very strong.</p>
<p>Only Human Sovereign could fight all sorts of powerful creatures head-on. Not only was he not at a disadvantage, but he even had the advantage.</p>
<p>It could be said that in the hearts of many people, Human Sovereign was their final bottom line and dignity as humans.</p>
<p>If Human Sovereign was no longer pure human, that bottom line would be breached. When that happened, more and more people would choose to contract with Guardians.</p>
<p>Those who could have taken their own paths might have chosen to become contractors because of this.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already determined the location of the Calamity gunner, but he knew very well that even if he instant transmited over, it would be impossible for him to find him.</p>
<p>With a slight movement of his fingers, two crystalline eyeballs appeared in his palm. Zhou Wen held the pair of Ghost God Eyes tightly and made them collide.</p>
<p>“Quickly end it. The rating will only be lower if he wastes any more time. No matter how many times he uses the same move, no matter how many bullets he splits, it won’t improve his rating. It will only lower it. If Human Sovereign has this intention, I’m afraid he’s wrong…” Professor Gu continued analyzing, but he suddenly saw a strange change in the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign’s entire head was within a helmet, preventing anyone from seeing his appearance, much less his facial features.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, one could see Human Sovereign’s eyes glowing resplendently. The light from his eyes penetrated the steel-like face armor like two searchlights emitting a red glow. Just a glance at it made one’s heart turn cold as though they had been targeted by the devil.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes stared at the spot he had determined. The wall in front of him suddenly seemed to turn transparent. His gaze passed through several walls and he realized that there was no sign of the Calamity gunner.</p>
<p>However, in the metal wall at the back, there was a humanoid creature. The creature’s body was identical to the metal wall. He had perfectly fused with the metal wall and was standing inside. Furthermore, he could move freely inside the wall.</p>
<p>The extremely hard metal was like water for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly see that the creature on the wall was holding a gun inside the wall and aiming it at him.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is… So this fellow can move freely in the metal and even use the metal to escape. It’s no wonder I couldn’t find his location… Zhou Wen knew that he had to kill him in one strike.</p>
<p>He could now see that fellow with the help of the Ghost God Eyes, but the power of the Ghost God Eyes couldn’t last long. If he missed, he wouldn’t have a second chance if the Calamity gunner escaped with the help of the Metal Escape technique.</p>
<p>For a potent force like the seventh sure-kill shot, it definitely needs some channeling time. At the moment before the bullet is shot, all his strength will probably be focused on the sniper gun. When that happens, it will definitely be difficult for him to use Metal Escape at the same time. This is the only chance. Zhou Wen was already prepared, but he didn’t know if his plan would succeed.</p>
<p>Everyone watched as Human Sovereign’s eyes lit up. In the next instant, his figure suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>Even the Cube’s camera paused for a moment, unable to immediately keep up with his movement. When Human Sovereign’s figure appeared on the screen again, people saw him standing in front of a metal wall.. He held the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand, and its blade had already completely sunk into the metal wall.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1424'>Chapter 1424: Reaching the Peak With Seven Stars</h3>
<p>“So that’s how it is. Human Sovereign aimed to kill the Calamity gunner. Unfortunately, he underestimates it too much. This is the home ground of the Calamity gunner to begin with. Even existences like Tsukuyomi, Xiao, and The Fallen found it difficult to find the location of the Calamity gunner. They could only choose to obtain as high a score as possible instead of killing it. The possibility of Human Sovereign successfully killing the Calamity gunner is slim, so it’s reasonable that the attack missed…” Professor Gu’s analysis was as most people thought.</p>
<p>However, before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, inch by inch, Human Sovereign pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword that was embedded in the wall.</p>
<p>As the Immortal Culling Sword was pulled out, energy spewed out like flames from the gap between the sword and the wall, illuminating the entire tunnel.</p>
<p>“No… No way…” In the Holy Land, the Saints widened their eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>Professor Gu, who was commenting, had his mouth agape, but he couldn’t finish his sentence. All he could do was watch as the light on the Cube’s screen intensified. The light reflected in his pupils nearly filled his entire eyes.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the Immortal Culling Sword was completely pulled out, the energy source that spewed out exploded, blasting apart the metal wall. A humanoid metal creature’s chest exploded as the energy source shattered. It fell out of the blasted wall and collapsed in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>A metal crystal dropped from his blasted chest. Zhou Wen picked it up and turned to walk towards the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>Without any Calamity-grade bullets appearing again, Zhou Wen walked up to the Golden Palace under everyone’s stunned gazes.</p>
<p>However, before reaching the Golden Palace, Zhou Wen switched to his Terror form. He had already experimented before. The Golden Palace relied on two aspects to rate the challenger.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was bloodline. If he dripped his blood in before entering, judgment would be based on his bloodline. Another attempt would only raise his stars and ranking, and he wouldn’t be given a metal ball.</p>
<p>However, other than dripping blood to enter the Venusian dimensional zone, one could also enter using spatial powers. As creatures that entered like this didn’t have any reference bloodline, the Venusian dimensional zone determined a rating using Life Providences, Life Souls, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had dripped his blood the last time he came in. The Terror transformation powers he used when he stepped up were The Disqualified, Singularity Universe, and Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen had used spatial powers to enter. He had converted all his attributes to Human Sovereign’s before ascending the Golden Palace.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door opened again as a blinding light shone from within. A metal ball slowly flew out and landed in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Cube’s scene changed and switched to the rankings. Everyone looked eagerly at the top of the rankings. When they saw the two words in their imagination, they felt an indescribable feeling in their hearts. It was as though it was only natural for it to appear, but it was also unbelievable. It was complicated and difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Then, everyone quickly swept their gazes behind the name.</p>
<p>One… Two… Three… Someone counted silently in his heart. Someone directly counted out loud. Even if they were not physically in the same place, they were unbelievably in sync.</p>
<p>“Four… Five… Six… Seven… Stars…” Someone finally couldn’t help but shout hoarsely,” Seven stars… Human Sovereign has seven stars… F*ck… It’s seven stars… Who the hell said that Human Sovereign can’t get first place…”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what are your thoughts?” The host couldn’t help but ask the stunned Professor Gu. As a fan of Human Sovereign, she was very displeased with Professor Gu’s previous analysis. If it wasn’t because of her professional ethics, she would have long retorted.</p>
<p>“This… is indeed a little unexpected…” Professor Gu couldn’t think of anything to say, so he coughed awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Haha, as expected, our Human Sovereign is invincible. What Saint Xiao? What’s so awesome about him? If he has the ability, kill the Calamity gunner.”</p>
<p>“I knew it. I knew that Human Sovereign would definitely do it. As Human Sovereign, wouldn’t killing a Calamity be child’s play?”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. That wasn’t what you said a moment ago?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“How did this happen? Didn’t Lord Holy God say that it’s virtually impossible for Calamity-grade creatures to kill the Calamity gunner in the Venusian dimensional zone? How did he do it?” A Saint was still in disbelief as he looked at the seven golden stars behind Human Sovereign’s name with a look of appalled surprise.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God only said that it’s virtually impossible, but that’s not an ordinary person,” Xiao said indifferently.</p>
<p>“But what do we do now? Lord Holy God said that we have to obtain first place and obtain the Venusian Companion Beast… Now…” the Saint said in a panic.</p>
<p>Thinking of the consequences of Holy God’s wrath, many Saints trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean what should we do? Can’t I just snatch back first place? Since Lord Holy God chose me, I naturally have to do the deed well. If Human Sovereign can do it, I can also do it,” Xiao said as he walked towards the Cube.</p>
<p>“Well said. Just snatch it back.” A voice sounded from a distant palace. A holy deity walked over step by step. Wherever he passed, all the Saints genuflected. No one dared to look at him.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God.” Xiao also genuflected.</p>
<p>“Not only do I want you to snatch back first place, but I also want you to kill that human. Can you do it?” Holy God asked as he looked down at Xiao.</p>
<p>“If there’s a chance, I’ll do my best,” Xiao said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“I can give you a chance, but failure is not an option,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“Only one of us will live,” Xiao answered firmly.</p>
<p>“Remember your words. If Human Sovereign doesn’t die, don’t even bother returning.” Holy God walked towards the Cube. When he stood on the Cube, the entire Cube lit up.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the ranking on the Cube and discussed what Companion Beast Human Sovereign would obtain.</p>
<p>The Cube that had already switched to the ranking screen suddenly changed again. It returned to the scene in the Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scene didn’t show the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone. It was still the scene in front of the Golden Palace. Zhou Wen was still standing in front of the Golden Palace and hadn’t been teleported out.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Everyone was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>This was unprecedented. Furthermore, the countdown hadn’t ended. There were still dozens of minutes left. It was still premature to say that Human Sovereign had obtained first place.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that he hadn’t been teleported out of the Golden Palace and knew that something was amiss. He immediately wanted to use spatial teleportation to leave the Golden Palace, but he realized that the space in the Golden Palace was isolated from the outside world. He couldn’t teleport out.</p>
<p>At the same time, a figure entered the Venusian dimensional zone. It was none other than Xiao.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately understood what had happened. The entire Federation broke into a furor.</p>
<p>“F*ck, again? Do you have any shame? It was Di Tian the last time. This time, it’s the Holy Land. If you can’t win, play dirty. Is everyone from the dimension so shameless?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1425'>Chapter 1425: Only One Person Can Leave Alive</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Xiao, he immediately engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>Since Xiao could make the Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods commit suicide and Zhou Wen was only at the Terror grade, he had to mount a full defense to not succumb to Xiao’s abilities.</p>
<p>Even with the double protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He focused his gaze on Xiao and grabbed the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword again.</p>
<p>“In our battle today, only one person can leave alive. Please do your best. Let Venus see who has the right to be the owner of the Venusian Companion Beast,” Xiao said as he walked over step by step.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never liked to waste his breath, much less talk nonsense with enemies. He immediately unsheathed the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand and slashed down with Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Speed and Strength were infinitely close to the Calamity grade. With Immortal Slaying combined with the Immortal Culling Sword, he could produce the power to kill a Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be taken into the game, Zhou Wen would have long used it to kill the Kui. He wouldn’t have needed to go through so much trouble using the Tyrant Behemoth boxing glove.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously seen Xiao. Back then, he was still very far from the Calamity grade. Now, it was certain that he had only recently advanced to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he could withstand the power of the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>However, Xiao didn’t dodge. When the Immortal Culling Sword reached him, he reached out to his waist. There was also a sword there, but it was different from the East District-like Immortal Culling Sword. The sword in his hand was a western-styled rapier.</p>
<p>The rapier was silver in color; even the scabbard was the same. It looked like it was made of pure silver, and the patterns on it were exquisite.</p>
<p>At the instant the rapier was unsheathed, Zhou Wen saw silver light collide with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>When the two swords clashed, the shockwave produced forced Zhou Wen and Xiao to retreat. The shockwave constantly spread out and struck the metal wall with a boom.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he looked at the silver rapier in Xiao’s hand. According to what he knew, a West District weapon like the rapier wasn’t steeped in history. It was unlikely to appear in myths and legends.</p>
<p>However, the silver rapier didn’t show any damage after clashing with the Immortal Culling Sword. Clearly, it wasn’t an ordinary item, but Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out its origins.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God is right. The sword forged from Holy Metal can indeed block that Immortal Culling Sword.” The Saints watching were delighted when they saw the Immortal Culling Sword blocked.</p>
<p>“Of course. When has Lord Holy God ever been wrong? That’s the Holy Sword that Lord Holy God personally bestowed to Xiao. The Holy Metal used to create the Holy Sword is the foundation of the Holy Temple. It was baptized by Holy Energy for countless years and has long been a supreme Holy item. It’s virtually indestructible. How can it be easily damaged?”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is only at the Terror grade. All he relies on is the Immortal Culling Sword. Now that the Holy Sword can withstand its blow, it will be a piece of cake for Xiao to defeat him.”</p>
<p>The Saints discussed spiritedly, but inside the Venusian dimensional zone, Xiao didn’t immediately counterattack.</p>
<p>He levitated in midair with his rapier casually held in front of his chest. He looked extremely elegant and natural, like an otherworldly swordsman.</p>
<p>“You haven’t reached the Calamity grade. If I defeat you with the Calamity Zone, I’m afraid you will die with a grievance,” Xiao said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Why? Do you plan on not using the Calamity Zone?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I’ll let you see the true strength of a Saint,” Xiao said as he instantly stabbed out with his rapier. The blade vanished from Zhou Wen’s vision, preventing him from seeing the trajectory of the strike.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he instantly moved horizontally. At the instant he moved, a silver beam flashed from his head, almost brushing past his hair.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had been any slower, his head would have been penetrated by the sword.</p>
<p>That was fast! Zhang Yuzhi’s heart nearly popped out when she saw this.</p>
<p>An Sheng, Li Xuan, An Jing, and company were also watching the battle. They were so nervous that their palms were sweating.</p>
<p>Xiao gracefully followed as he stabbed out again and again. The rapier and his figure were unbelievably fast. His usual speed could reach the speed of light, but the instant he struck out, he was so fast that even Zhou Wen couldn’t see the trajectory of the sword.</p>
<p>Even Tsukuyomi’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The clashing sounds of the blades and the impacts of the shockwave constantly echoed. Xiao’s terrifying rapier had been completely blocked by Zhou Wen. None of the strikes could injure him.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Although Human Sovereign is strong… it’s all thanks to the power that the sword gives him. That’s how he can kill a Calamity-grade. However, his speed and reaction shouldn’t reach the level of a Calamity-grade. Furthermore, Xiao’s stabbing speed probably can’t even be seen by ordinary Calamity-grade creatures. How did Human Sovereign block it?” The Saints were alarmed.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and the others who were on good terms with Zhou Wen, as well as the ordinary humans, were pleasantly surprised. Wang Lu also heaved a sigh of relief as she held her hands in front of her chest. Unknowingly, she was already covered in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“I knew it. What kind of existence is Human Sovereign? A mere Calamity-grade can’t do anything to him.” The people who had held their breaths while watching were immediately overjoyed when they saw that Human Sovereign remained calm and composed under the unbelievable rapier. He had blocked all of Xiao’s attacks.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to doubt if Human Sovereign is really pure human. Such an ability really doesn’t seem like what a pure human is capable of,” Zhang Chunqiu said jokingly.</p>
<p>“Indeed. He can actually see the trajectory of the sword. Such eyesight should have exceeded the limits of a Terror-grade?” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“No, he didn’t see it, nor can he see it. The ability I’m referring to isn’t this,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“He can’t see it?” Zhang Yuzhi was taken aback as she asked in disbelief, “How does he block it if he can’t see it? Furthermore, he looks to be at ease. It doesn’t look like it was luck.”</p>
<p>“Of course it isn’t luck. True, you can’t say that he can’t see it. It can only be said that he can’t see the rapier’s trajectory, but he can see Xiao’s movements.” Noticing Zhang Yuzhi’s incomprehension, Zhang Chunqiu continued explaining, “Xiao’s rapier is unbelievably fast. It might also be a spatial ability. No matter what ability it is, it’s impossible for the Terror-grade Human Sovereign to see the trajectory of the rapier. Even if he can see it, it’s impossible for him to react.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, Human Sovereign isn’t looking at the rapier at all. He fixes his eyes on Xiao’s actions. Although Xiao’s speed is very fast, he isn’t as fast as the rapier. It’s still within Human Sovereign’s reaction speed. Human Sovereign uses Xiao’s actions to determine his target and block his attack.” After Zhang Chunqiu explained, he couldn’t help but praise, “It sounds simple, but a battle at that level is ever-changing. To be able to accurately block an almost invisible sword with just the other party’s actions is truly shocking. Even if I had the same strength as him, I might not be able to do it to such an extent. This fellow doesn’t look human at all.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1426'>Chapter 1426: Sword Combat</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s The Disqualified had the ability to spy on the weakness of everything, so he naturally understood immediately that it was impossible to see Xiao’s sword clearly, but he could determine the necessary actions he needed from Xiao’s actions.</p>
<p>To others, it was impossible to block all attacks with just judgment in such a fast battle. However, Zhou Wen was relaxed and at ease.</p>
<p>All things had their strengths, but they definitely had their weaknesses. Unless the other party’s overall standard was strong enough to crush Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would ultimately grasp their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Xiao naturally discovered the problem as his sword art suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Xiao wanted to use an ever-changing sword art to make Zhou Wen make a mistake. Just one mistake, even if it was just a millisecond slower, would be enough to deal a fatal blow.</p>
<p>“Why is Xiao’s sword art… Why is it… a little strange…” Zhang Yuzhi’s eyesight wasn’t good enough, so she could only make out a blur. This allowed her to feel that Xiao’s sword art was somewhat different, but she couldn’t tell what was different.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said with a heavy expression, “It looks like an incorrectly done jigsaw puzzle, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the feeling. What’s going on? With the standards Xiao displayed, his sword art should have already entered a sublime realm. It’s impossible for him to make such a mistake,” Zhang Yuzhi hurriedly said with a nod.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a mistake, but a deliberate action on Xiao’s part. The first move he’s using now comes from different sword arts. The previous move is completely different from the next move’s style. It’s even diametrically opposite. It’s to make it difficult for Human Sovereign to determine the angle and position of his sword.”</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu paused for a moment before continuing with a frown, “This Xiao is really extraordinary. There aren’t any flaws despite using all sorts of sword arts; yet, it makes one feel as though there’s something misaligned. What’s even more terrifying is that the sword techniques he’s proficient in almost encompass all the types of sword techniques I know. To be able to master all sorts of sword arts to such an extent is testament to this fellow’s immense talent.”</p>
<p>“Won’t Human Sovereign be in grave danger? You previously said that Human Sovereign relied on determining his actions to withstand his attacks. Now, with the combination of such random swords, and with it being difficult to distinguish what’s real, wouldn’t Human Sovereign immediately be severely injured if he makes a mistake?” Zhang Yuzhi said worriedly.</p>
<p>“In theory, it’s indeed very difficult not to make any mistakes. However, Human Sovereign probably can’t leave even if he wants to. He has to not make any mistakes or think of a way to counterattack. Otherwise, he’s a sitting duck,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>An Sheng and Li Xuan were already so nervous that they were mute. They naturally could tell that Zhou Wen was in a terrible situation.</p>
<p>There were thousands of sword arts in the world. It was impossible for a person to have seen all the sword arts in the world even if he spent his entire life doing so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a technique of faking moves in sword arts. If Zhou Wen made a wrong judgment once, his outcome would be tragic. From their point of view, Zhou Wen was dancing on the tip of a blade. Any carelessness would immediately lead to a bloody calamity.</p>
<p>“Where did the Holy Land find this Xiao? He’s terrifying. To be able to cultivate his sword art to such a level, even without the help of the Holy Land and Guardians, he definitely won’t be ordinary,” Xia Liuchuan said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue could also tell that Xiao’s sword art had indeed reached a sublime realm. It was probably difficult to find humans in the world who could cultivate sword arts to such a level.</p>
<p>Xiao was in no way inferior to the few most famous swordsmen. Furthermore, Xiao was better than them in one aspect.</p>
<p>Ya from the Holy Spirit Association was also a sword expert. The female sword immortal from Luoyang and Swordsman Tomorrow were all sword experts, but their sword art had been cultivated to the extreme in one particular style.</p>
<p>However, Xiao seemed to have cultivated all the sword arts in the world to the limit. Even a slightly less talented swordsman could not match the sword moves he casually unleashed despite practicing his entire life.</p>
<p>However, in Xiao’s hands, such sword arts seemed basic.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, Xiao is indeed talented. He’s probably the only Saint who can cultivate sword arts to such a level,” the old Saint by Holy God’s side whispered.</p>
<p>“His sword arts are indeed very good, but such sword arts can’t kill Human Sovereign,” said Holy God indifferently.</p>
<p>The Saint was immediately alarmed when he heard that. “Such a sword art, coupled with the Trajectory technique that even a Calamity-grade might not be able to see clearly, still can’t kill Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>Even a Calamity-grade creature would probably find it difficult to last long in a melee battle with Xiao. There would ultimately be times when they made miscalculations.</p>
<p>“This Human Sovereign is indeed a hero among humans. It’s a pity I didn’t discover him in the past,” Holy God said with interest.</p>
<p>The old Saint naturally understood that the pity the Holy God mentioned was that Human Sovereign couldn’t be nurtured into a Saint.</p>
<p>“If Lord Holy God is interested in him, you can let Xiao spare his life. It won’t be difficult for him to join the Holy Temple and become a Saint,” the old Saint said.</p>
<p>Holy God turned his head to look at the old Saint. The old Saint’s body immediately trembled as he hurriedly knelt down and prostrated on the ground. With a trembling voice, he said, “I spoke too much. Your Excellency, please mete out punishment.”</p>
<p>“You are not allowed to say a word for three years. Commit suicide if you violate it,” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>The old Saint didn’t dare say a word as he kowtowed.</p>
<p>Holy God ignored him and continued, “All Saints have to be nurtured from birth. There can be no exception.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Those who could truly tell what was happening were worried about Human Sovereign’s ability to block Xiao’s sword arts.</p>
<p>Or perhaps Human Sovereign could reverse the situation by using internecine methods.</p>
<p>However, they soon realized that Human Sovereign didn’t do so. He relied on his sword arts to fight Xiao, and the battle continued. The harrowing scene they had imagined didn’t happen.</p>
<p>No matter how Xiao’s sword arts changed, Zhou Wen didn’t make any mistakes. He accurately blocked all the attacks. Furthermore, his attacks caused Xiao some trouble.</p>
<p>“Can he really not see Xiao strike?” Xia Liuchuan, who was originally very worried, gradually wore a strange expression after watching for a while.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign didn’t seem to be relying on judgment to fight Xiao. Otherwise, how could he do it without making any mistakes under Xiao’s complicated sword arts?</p>
<p>However, they knew very well that it was impossible to see Xiao’s strike. Even if they could see it, it would be too late. Action had to be taken before Xiao thrust his sword to block it. Therefore, Human Sovereign definitely didn’t rely on sight.</p>
<p>“This fellow is really a monster. He’s definitely not a pure human.” Even the head of the Cape family couldn’t help but say.</p>
<p>“I really want to fight Human Sovereign. I’ll be happy even if I die.” In the Ultimate Family Clan in the North District, Lance stared at Zhou Wen with his eyes glowing.</p>
<p>The Heart Defying Sword that Zhou Wen had comprehended from the three thousand sword intents covered all kinds of sword arts. With the ability of The Disqualified, no matter how Xiao’s sword arts changed, it didn’t affect Zhou Wen much.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be impressed by Xiao’s strength. Up to now, he had never used two sword arts that were identical. It greatly weakened the ability of The Disqualified.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1427'>Chapter 1427: Worship</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Since you aren’t using the Calamity Zone, I’ll kill you before you start using it. Zhou Wen was just about to take the opportunity to deal a ruthless blow when he suddenly felt the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder react.</p>
<p>In his consciousness, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder lit up. The book’s surface automatically opened as golden runes appeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also felt immense mental pressure. Thankfully, his willpower was terrifyingly strong. The mental suppression didn’t shake his willpower.</p>
<p>What happened to not using the Calamity Zone? He didn’t even say a word and directly used it. It’s indeed the shameless Saint Xiao! Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared and wasn’t affected. Just as he was about to curse, a thought flashed in his mind, but he immediately gave up on the idea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there blankly as his expression turned livid. He held the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand and swiped it at his neck.</p>
<p>“No good! That bastard Xiao went back on his word. He used the Calamity Zone when Old Zhou wasn’t prepared!” Li Xuan was alarmed as he jumped up, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was also given a fright as she widened her eyes and covered her mouth, not daring to look any further.</p>
<p>Everyone recalled the scene of the Metal Guards and Golden Battle Gods committing suicide when Xiao attempted the level.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign was only at the Terror grade after all. It was definitely not impossible for him to commit suicide under Xiao’s Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>However, Human Sovereign still looked like he was struggling. He didn’t directly swipe at his neck as though he wasn’t completely controlled. He was still resisting.</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t hesitate as he stabbed at Zhou Wen quickly.</p>
<p>His sword was unbelievably fast to begin with, and this strike was so fast that it almost vanished along with him.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen’s eyes regained clarity as his body suddenly spun. The Immortal Culling Sword that was aimed at his neck spun with his body before slashing down into the void.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>The sound of silk being sliced through was heard. As it was too fast, no one saw what had happened.</p>
<p>After a slight pause, people realized that Xiao had already returned to his original spot. A patch from his robe had been sliced off, and Zhou Wen was still standing there with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand. His eyes were clear, and he didn’t have any intention of committing suicide.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, he nearly frightened me to death! Li Xuan immediately understood that Zhou Wen had lured Xiao into a trap. However, from the looks of it, he hadn’t really injured Xiao.</p>
<p>“How shameless. Didn’t you say that you won’t use the Calamity Zone? You want to have a fair battle with Human Sovereign? How long has it been and you’re already going back on your word.”</p>
<p>“How is this going back on his word? It’s a premeditated scheme to cause harm. Thankfully, my Human Sovereign is strong enough and wasn’t harmed by him.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is amazing as ever. Unfortunately, he failed to kill him with one strike.”</p>
<p>People like Zhang Chunqiu had also been given a fright. They heaved a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was still nervously staring at the live broadcast, but she didn’t relax.</p>
<p>“You are despicable,” Xiao said as he looked at his sleeve. Thankfully, he hadn’t used all his strength to kill Zhou Wen. Otherwise, he might not have been able to escape unscathed.</p>
<p>“Takes one to know one,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at Xiao.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder in his body was crazily converting Essence Energy. Even Truth Listener was converting Essence Energy, indicating that the power of Evil Nullification was working.</p>
<p>Even so, Zhou Wen could sense a powerful mental pressure. Xiao’s Calamity Zone was rather complicated. It wasn’t a lone power.</p>
<p>Only Zhou Wen could withstand it. If it were any other ordinary Terror-grade creature, they would probably have committed suicide.</p>
<p>“I originally wanted you to die without pain. Since you don’t appreciate my kindness, I can only let you die in pain,” Xiao said as the Calamity Zone power from his body grew stronger.</p>
<p>As the domain’s power increased, Xiao became more and more holy. He was like a deity, as though taking another look at him was desecrating him.</p>
<p>Many of the ordinary people watching the battle through the Cube seemed to be possessed. They prostrated on the ground and worshiped Xiao.</p>
<p>In front of the Cube all over the world, there was a black mass of people kneeling.</p>
<p>Even the people watching the broadcast through the television did the same. All of them prostrated in front of the television—before Xiao.</p>
<p>In the beginning, this was only limited to ordinary people. Later on, humans at the Legendary and Epic stage began to succumb. They gradually knelt down uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“What a powerful domain power. Its influence can actually spread to such a large area!” Zhang Chunqiu realized that many members of the Zhang family nearby were beginning to worship things like phones and television.</p>
<p>Even Zhang Chunqiu felt a very strong mental influence.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and An Sheng were fine. Their mental fortitude was very strong. Just watching the live broadcast didn’t affect them much.</p>
<p>An Jing could also withstand it, but many soldiers and workers in Overseer Manor were already prostrating on the ground as long as they watched the battle. They were like pious believers.</p>
<p>Even a Mythical officer had a ferocious expression as though he was in a battle. His knees bent bit by bit and he was close to kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>“Is that fellow’s Calamity Zone that powerful? It can actually affect something so far away? They are on Venus, and this is Earth!” Li Xuan could also sense the pressure. He looked at the soldiers and officers outside and was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>“That should be a domain that focuses on mental strength. Therefore, it can be transmitted through videos without any distance restriction. There’s no need to worry about this. Young Master’s mental fortitude isn’t something an ordinary person can compare with. If he wants to use this power to deal with Young Master, he’s gravely mistaken,” An Sheng said coldly.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t as relaxed as An Sheng imagined.</p>
<p>Xiao’s Calamity Zone had a very potent psyche power. The psyche power was also one of the strongest powers that could affect humans elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the only power in Xiao’s Calamity Zone. There was also a power that made the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener react.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there were other powers. In this complicated Calamity Zone, Zhou Wen realized that his body was still affected.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t to the point of committing suicide or completely losing control of his body, it still had a negative effect. His actions deviated slightly.</p>
<p>It was just like a patient with Parkinson’s disease. There would be signs of fingers trembling uncontrollably, albeit very mild.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was fighting Xiao. Xiao’s rapier didn’t stop. Zhou Wen’s fingers only needed to tremble a few times before he found himself in immediate danger.</p>
<p>The tip of the rapier slashed across his shoulder. On the Prisoned Dragon armor with Absolute Defense, there was a sword mark. Thankfully, it wasn’t penetrated.</p>
<p>However, Xiao’s Calamity Zone powers were still strengthening. The effects on Zhou Wen became more and more intense. It wasn’t just his hands, face, body—even his legs and feet would spasm from time to time.</p>
<p>Although it only happened once in a while and wasn’t a constant influence, it already left Zhou Wen in a dire situation.</p>
<p>Not good! Zhou Wen could still forcefully control his body and not cause any major problems.. However, as Xiao’s Calamity Zone became stronger, it was only a matter of time before Xiao found an opportunity.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1428'>Chapter 1428: Gods’ Zone</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Things aren’t good.” Hui Haifeng frowned. Anyone at a certain level could sense that Human Sovereign’s rhythm had turned problematic.</p>
<p>Originally, Human Sovereign could easily block Xiao’s sword without making any unnecessary movements. But now, people could clearly sense that Human Sovereign’s actions weren’t as clean as before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice. In order to ensure that there was a backup plan when a part of his body encountered a problem, he had to make more preparations. Therefore, his actions weren’t clean anymore.</p>
<p>Although he could just withstand Xiao’s attacks, Zhou Wen knew that this wasn’t a long-term solution. He had to resolve the present situation before his body encountered an irreversible problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how he could crack the current situation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t impossible for a Terror-grade to fight a Calamity-grade, but he had to resolve the huge problem of the Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>The Calamity-grade creatures that Zhou Wen had previously killed had Calamity Zones which didn’t affect him much, but Xiao’s Calamity Zone was somewhat different. It was a very complicated domain power.</p>
<p>There were nomological powers, curses, psyche attacks, and other things.</p>
<p>The nomological powers had already been restrained by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The curses had been resolved by Truth Listener. Zhou Wen could withstand psyche attacks with his willpower.</p>
<p>Now, there was still an unknown power that affected Zhou Wen’s body. He had to resolve this power before he could truly fight Xiao fairly.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Due to his fingers twitching uncontrollably, Zhou Wen failed to block Xiao’s sword in time. Although he had retreated in time, Xiao had still stabbed him in the shoulder.</p>
<p>The sword stabbed through the Prisoned Dragon armor, leaving a tiny hole. As Zhou Wen retreated, blood spewed out when the tip of the sword separated from his body.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the Prisoned Dragon armor in between him and the sword, Zhou Wen had the time to retreat. This strike only slightly injured him. It didn’t pierce through his bones.</p>
<p>Many people’s hearts tightened. Human Sovereign being injured was a very bad sign.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at a disadvantage as Xiao’s attacks became more and more ferocious. He was like an elegant swordsman as he stabbed out repeatedly with his rapier. He was so fast that nobody could see the sword beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated as he fought, but due to his body being affected by the Calamity Zone, he kept making mistakes and getting injured. More and more bloody holes appeared on the Prisoned Dragon armor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was constantly carving all sorts of Essence Energy Arts to see if there was any power that could restrain the unknown power in the Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>However, after trying all the Essence Energy Arts he was good at, there was no power that could restrain that unknown power.</p>
<p>If my guess is right, Xiao’s Calamity Zone should be related to faith. As Zhou Wen fought, he constantly thought. Many times, brute force couldn’t change the outcome. Instead, it might make the situation worse. Zhou Wen needed to find a better solution.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen determined that Xiao’s Calamity Zone was a power that depended on something like faith. It had the nomological power of a deity and the nature of a curse. It could also control one’s mind. No matter how he thought about it, it was related to faith.</p>
<p>If it’s a faith zone, what kind of power can affect one’s body? I’m not his believer, and my will won’t be affected. With Truth Listener around, curses are useless against me… In theory, I should be able to withstand the power of faith. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Xiao’s attacks became more and more ferocious. More and more wounds appeared on Zhou Wen’s body as blood constantly spewed out from the blade’s thrusts. Furthermore, his injuries were getting closer and closer to his vital spots.</p>
<p>This was because the Calamity Zone’s power was affecting Zhou Wen more and more. Now, Zhou Wen’s actions would sometimes result in serious mistakes. Once, one of his legs had nearly been sliced off by Xiao.</p>
<p>“Save him!” Wang Lu held her hands in front of her chest. She didn’t dare look any further as she closed her eyes and prayed.</p>
<p>“Not good. Human Sovereign has been greatly affected by the Calamity Zone. His body is beginning to show signs of losing control,” Xia Liuchuan said worriedly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Xia Liuchuan. Even ordinary people could tell that Human Sovereign’s situation wasn’t good. Even if one didn’t have the eyesight to see the battle, the blood that splattered made it obvious how terrible Human Sovereign’s situation was.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a slow-motion replay by the media. Under the slow-motion replay, one could vaguely see Human Sovereign being stabbed. This made one’s heart ache even more.</p>
<p>Silence prevailed in front of the Cubes and televisions everywhere around the world. Some women and children couldn’t help but clasp their hands together and pray for Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Most humans didn’t wish for Human Sovereign to lose, much less die.</p>
<p>Could it be the power of misfortune? In many myths and legends, not only can deities cast curses, but they can also inflict humans with misfortune! With a thought, Zhou Wen secretly summoned a few Luck Companion Beasts in their equipment form and wore them within his armor.</p>
<p>However, the lucky equipment didn’t do a thing. Zhou Wen’s lack of control over his body kept increasing in frequency.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately knew that he had been wrong. It wasn’t the power of misfortune. If it was the power of misfortune, even if his luck wasn’t good enough, it would still show a certain effect.</p>
<p>However, as this lucky equipment was useless, it was definitely not because of the power of misfortune.</p>
<p>If it’s not misfortune, what could it be? Zhou Wen’s mind raced. Although his injuries were constantly increasing, his mind was extremely calm. There weren’t many fluctuations. The dense sword holes and blood that bloomed on his body didn’t seem to be from him.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is rather interesting.” Holy God sized up Human Sovereign with interest and muttered to himself, “I used my avatar to help Xiao advance to the Calamity grade. Although that avatar is only at the Human Realm, the Gods’ Zone formed by the power of Xiao’s Guardian has an absolute suppressive effect on creatures below the Calamity grade. Even creatures at the Human Realm will be greatly affected. They might even become servants. Human Sovereign is only at the Terror grade, but he can actually last so long in the Gods’ Zone without completely losing control of himself. It’s quite surprising.”</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, there’s not much time left. Will Xiao be fine?” Saint looked at the time and realized that there were less than twenty minutes left before the Cube’s countdown ended.</p>
<p>“It’s enough. Under the Gods’ Zone, Human Sovereign no longer has the possibility of turning the tables,” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>He was very confident because half of Xiao’s Calamity-grade power came from his avatar.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1429'>Chapter 1429: Huge Club</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was indeed in a terrible state. He had tried all sorts of powers, but he was ultimately unable to crack the influence Xiao’s Calamity Zone had on him.</p>
<p>Even if he wasn’t afraid of his identity being exposed, using the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was still unable to change his present disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation needed Zhou Wen’s control. If Zhou Wen couldn’t even control his body, how could he control the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation? When that happened, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation would collapse on its own and be useless.</p>
<p>If it’s not the power of misfortune, what could it be? Zhou Wen was puzzled. He really couldn’t figure out what kind of power eluded him.</p>
<p>This made Zhou Wen suspect that his judgment was wrong. Xiao’s domain power had nothing to do with faith.</p>
<p>However, he quickly eliminated this possibility. No matter how he looked at it, the domain was definitely related to the power of faith.</p>
<p>He’s almost at his limit. He shouldn’t be able to last much longer. Sweetie stood not far from Zhou Wen with a rather ambivalent expression.</p>
<p>The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body worsened. There were sword holes everywhere on the Prisoned Dragon armor. The armor was almost completely dyed blood-red.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was the Prisoned Dragon armor. If it were any other armor, Zhou Wen would have long been stabbed to death.</p>
<p>Even with the Prisoned Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense, it was on the brink of collapse. If this continued, it would probably shatter.</p>
<p>I can’t break the rules… But… But… But… I can’t let Zhou Wen die at the hands of others… Yes… I need to avenge Yana… I can’t let others kill him… Sweetie seemed to convince herself as she thought to herself, Besides, I’m not helping him. I’m just maintaining fairness. Mommy said that maintaining fairness is God’s responsibility; it’s not breaking the rules.</p>
<p>That human using the Calamity Zone to deal with a person without a domain is unfair in itself. Furthermore, I’m not trying to crack his domain. I’m just wiping away the blessing power within. This isn’t helping Zhou Wen at all. It’s wrong to use blessing powers on the enemy to begin with. This isn’t giving Zhou Wen an advantage. I’m just helping him get back on course. Yes, that’s right. In fact, I’m helping that person defeat Zhou Wen and avenge Yana. Sweetie finally mentally steeled herself and was about to eliminate the blessing power in the Gods’ Zone.</p>
<p>However, before Sweetie did anything, Zhou Wen suddenly did something unexpected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned as a white club appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>Sweetie couldn’t help but stop. For Zhou Wen to suddenly summon such a white club at such a time meant that he likely had some idea. Perhaps it was a secret weapon.</p>
<p>“That club looks a little big. Its offensive strength must be very powerful, right?”</p>
<p>“It looks very strong. It’s definitely Human Sovereign’s secret weapon.”</p>
<p>“Quickly kill that Xiao. It’s too stifling.”</p>
<p>Everyone widened their eyes as they wanted to see how Zhou Wen could turn the tables. Although the chances weren’t high, Human Sovereign must have some special use for summoning such Companion Beast equipment.</p>
<p>“Bro, do you know what Companion Beast that huge club is?” Zhang Yuzhi looked at Zhang Chunqiu. She had a deep understanding of Companion Beasts, but she didn’t know what Companion Beast it was.</p>
<p>“You are a Companion Beast expert yourself. If you don’t know it, I wouldn’t know either.” Zhang Chunqiu was being humble. His knowledge wasn’t inferior to Zhang Yuzhi’s, but he didn’t recognize what Companion Beast it was.</p>
<p>“However, for Human Sovereign to take it out at this moment and how it looks like a very domineering weapon, Human Sovereign is probably going to go all out,” Zhang Chunqiu said after some thought.</p>
<p>Many people shared the same thoughts as Zhang Chunqiu. They felt that at this stage, Human Sovereign was definitely going to risk his life.</p>
<p>All eyes were focused on the white club. It looked like it was made of crystal jade. It was thick and huge, bigger than an extra-large baseball bat.</p>
<p>In Human Sovereign’s hand, it looked especially imposing. It looked even more ferocious than the Immortal Culling Sword in his other hand.</p>
<p>“He’s moving!” someone shouted.</p>
<p>The club in Zhou Wen’s hand finally moved. Everyone held their breaths as they waited for Human Sovereign’s next shocking strike.</p>
<p>Some people even wondered if the huge club would destroy Xiao’s Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>Although people knew that it was almost impossible, they couldn’t help but fantasize.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The club struck with all its might, but this strike left everyone dumbfounded. Their mouths gaped open as though they had swallowed a huge invisible duck egg. They stared blankly at the live broadcast.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign’s club wasn’t directed at Xiao, but at himself.</p>
<p>“What… What… What’s going on… Human Sovereign knows that he can’t win… Is he trying to commit suicide?” Xia Liuchuan’s mouth was agape for a long time before he finally said those words. His face was filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t wish to commit suicide. The huge club was actually transformed from Tai Sui. It looked rather domineering, but its offensive strength wasn’t strong. To Zhou Wen, who was wearing armor, such an attack couldn’t injure him at all.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen did so was that he had thought of another possibility.</p>
<p>Xiao’s domain power was definitely related to faith. Zhou Wen had gone through all the various powers related to faith, and he finally thought of blessing powers.</p>
<p>The most direct want humans had when having faith in deities was naturally to obtain blessings. This was also the most basic power of deities.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought of blessing because the power of blessing clearly had benefits. However, when he was stumped, he thought carefully about it.</p>
<p>After all, he had seen The Thearch’s power of wishes. Making wishes was beautiful, but The Thearch’s power of wishes could also be used for evil.</p>
<p>Then, blessing powers might not necessarily be absolutely positive. For example, words like “I wish your entire family XXX” often appeared on the Internet. Clearly, they weren’t very pleasant.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.</p>
<p>Only such a seemingly friendly but actually very sinister power could bypass the Evil Nullification of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener and directly affect Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s body had been affected by the Calamity Zone for so long without being injured at all. Instead, he could vaguely sense that his muscles had strengthened a little.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen began considering how to crack the power of blessing.</p>
<p>Luck definitely wouldn’t work because a blessing was a seemingly pleasant power to begin with. Luck would only strengthen the power of blessing and not weaken him.</p>
<p>The higher the value, the greater the influence of the power of blessing. Good things might not necessarily have a good outcome.</p>
<p>In theory, he should use misfortune or some power to block blessing powers. Unfortunately, the Bamboo Blade had already shattered. Otherwise, it might have been of some use.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before looking at Tai Sui’s Terror form. He realized that Tai Sui’s Terror form was something he had already seen before. A negative symbol would drop his luck, causing nothing to drop. He immediately had a thought and summoned Tai Sui after it turned into a huge club. He planned on giving it a try.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1430'>Chapter 1430: Final Countdown</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Tai Sui’s attack needed to hit someone to produce effects. As the saying went, breaking ground where Tai Sui presided required touching Tai Sui. Although Zhou Wen didn’t need to break ground, he had to touch Tai Sui.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously experimented. The stronger Tai Sui’s attack was and the more attacks it delivered, the greater the effects of the Tai Sui God symbol.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel any pain when he struck his head with Tai Sui, but the feeling of having lost control immediately weakened. The automatic strengthening of his muscles also decreased significantly.</p>
<p>It works! He was immediately delighted as he smashed the club on his head again.</p>
<p>The main reason was that Tai Sui’s strength was too weak. Zhou Wen could use more strength if he did the smashing for it. On the other hand, holding Tai Sui would also affect him to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Hence, everyone saw a shocking scene. Human Sovereign held a huge club in one hand and smashed it on his head. His other hand held the Immortal Culling Sword as he fought Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao, who had the upper hand, gradually had Zhou Wen turn the tide. Soon, he found it difficult to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>“How… How do you explain this?” Xia Liuchuan’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Is this the legendary meme of you wouldn’t like me when I’m angry; I’ll beat myself?”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is freaking amazing! Is he giving Xiao a few club strikes as a handicap before beating him to the ground?”</p>
<p>“Could this be the legendary Great Sadomasochistic technique? The more self-mutilation, the stronger one becomes?”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Everyone was amused when they saw Human Sovereign smashing himself with a club with one hand and fighting Xiao crazily with the other. The more he fought, the more ferocious he became. He seemed to be about to suppress Xiao.</p>
<p>Holy God looked at Zhou Wen in a daze and didn’t say a word. The Saints beside him were even more silent. They didn’t even dare look up or watch the battle, much less speak.</p>
<p>Without the power of blessing to cause trouble, Zhou Wen brought Xiao back to the beginning with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Xiao watched as Human Sovereign kept smashing himself while smashing him. He was clearly surprised.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, when he looked at the time, his expression immediately turned solemn. There were only sixteen minutes left.</p>
<p>How troublesome! Xiao frowned inwardly. At the same time, his figure flashed as he left the battlefield. He didn’t continue attacking Zhou Wen as he raised the rapier in his hand. The blade was right in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>“The reason Calamity-grade creatures can be called Calamity-grade creatures is definitely beyond your comprehension.” With Xiao’s voice, a strange power rose from the rapier in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at Xiao as he continued smashing himself with the Tai Sui club. However, he felt a little apprehensive.</p>
<p>The rapier in Xiao’s hand seemed to gradually fuse with his Calamity Zone. The feeling was indescribable as though the entire domain was attached to the rapier.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the rapier in Xiao’s hand moved again.</p>
<p>If Xiao’s previous sword art only had a strange trajectory, then his present sword art was no longer as simple as its trajectory being difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Many people could see the trajectory of the thrust clearly, but despite being able to see it clearly, it made them feel like slamming their heads into it.</p>
<p>It was as though the rapier was a shimmering flame, while others were like the moths flying towards the fire.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a devil’s voice saying, “How satisfying would it be to rush forward and let the blade pierce through your chest.”</p>
<p>This was an unreasonable matter, but even the people watching the battle through the live broadcast had the urge to charge at the rapier and let it pierce through their chests.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that they couldn’t rush over, many people would have already slammed into the rapier.</p>
<p>“He has just advanced to the Calamity grade and advanced with the help of external forces; yet, he can actually comprehend the way to become one with the domain. Such talent is rare.” Holy God revealed a look of surprise.</p>
<p>After an ordinary creature advanced to the Calamity grade, it was already very difficult for them to stably use their domain powers. To use domain powers as freely as Xiao required a long period of comprehension and training.</p>
<p>It was akin to a person who had never ridden a bicycle before managing to drive an F1 car at professional standards after recently getting an F1 car or just knowing how to drive one. It was no wonder that Holy God was surprised.</p>
<p>However, what surprised Holy God even more was that even though Xiao had already done so, Human Sovereign still managed to block all of Xiao’s attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Human Sovereign was fighting with a sword in one hand and striking himself with the club in the other.</p>
<p>Although Xiao was very strong, Zhou Wen was immune to his domain’s power. With the effects of The Disqualified, unless Xiao was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t see his actions, no matter how powerful the rapier was, it would be blocked by the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Xiao’s attacks became more and more ferocious, but he ultimately failed to injure Zhou Wen. As for the Cube’s countdown, there was less than a minute left.</p>
<p>Xiao’s eyes revealed a look of worry. His eyes shimmered as though he was secretly thinking about something.</p>
<p>“Sigh… Xiao… What a pity… If I had known this would happen… I wouldn’t have chosen you…” Holy God sighed as though he was feeling wistful, but it was unknown what he was feeling regretful about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used all his strength to fight Xiao. To fight a Calamity-grade creature at the Terror grade, especially such a Calamity-grade creature, Zhou Wen could only block Xiao’s attack despite using all his strength. It was difficult to defeat him.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen realized that Xiao’s various techniques, be it his movement techniques or sword arts, weren’t inferior to his. If not for The Disqualified and various Essence Energy Arts, it would be difficult for him to be Xiao’s match even with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for some reason, after such a long battle, Zhou Wen felt a sense of familiarity—one which he couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that Xiao’s attacks were happening faster again. This time, it wasn’t just his sword speed. Even Xiao’s speed had increased. It was much faster than before. This left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t even see Xiao’s actions clearly, it would be impossible for him to block his subsequent strikes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up Xiao and realized that the armor on Xiao’s body was emitting a holy light. The light was pure and flawless, like glass that purified all the impurities in the armor. It made the armor gradually turn transparent and crystalline.</p>
<p>As the holy light intensified, Xiao’s strength became stronger and stronger; likewise for his speed. It was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t even see Xiao’s actions clearly.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen blocked three strikes in a row. Even with the augmentation of the Immortal Culling Sword’s power, Zhou Wen was still forced to retreat. The hand holding the sword kept trembling as the flesh between his thumb and index finger ruptured with gushing blood.</p>
<p>“If you want to survive, kill Human Sovereign before the countdown. Otherwise, descend into Samsara with Human Sovereign.” Holy God watched the battle without any emotion in his eyes.</p>
<p>Xiao was able to advance to the Calamity grade because he had fused with Holy God’s avatar. Holy God had already activated his avatar. If Xiao failed to kill Zhou Wen before the Cube’s countdown ended, Xiao, who had fused with his avatar, would self-destruct.. The power of self-destruction was enough to destroy any creature below the Calamity grade.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1431'>Chapter 1431: Self-Destruction</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener and Great Brahma’s powers to their limits. With the augmentation of The Disqualified, he forcefully blocked and dodged Xiao’s attack.</p>
<p>However, Xiao’s strength and speed had exceeded the limits of Zhou Wen’s abilities. The light shimmering over his body illuminated the entire Venusian dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The intense silver sword beams crisscrossed. The blinding light made it impossible to see what was happening inside. All one could see was the blinding sword beams on the screen intensify. Apart from that, nothing else could be seen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept retreating. He could only constantly move and position himself to deal with Xiao’s attacks by relying on his judgment and blind guesses.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Prisoned Dragon armor was penetrated again and again. This time, not only did it penetrate the armor, but even his bones and flesh were penetrated. It nearly injured Zhou Wen’s vital spots several times.</p>
<p>Although the spectators couldn’t see the battle inside, the powerful sword beam was enough to let everyone know what was happening.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign… Hold on…” Everyone found it difficult to speak. All they could do was pray inwardly. They clearly couldn’t see anything, but they still stared intently at the screen. Their eyes were blinded by the light as they cried. They just couldn’t bear to look away.</p>
<p>The countdown ticked by, and Xiao had yet to kill Zhou Wen when there were less than ten seconds left.</p>
<p>Ten… Nine… Eight… Seven… Zhou Wen kept counting silently in his heart. He could also tell that Xiao’s rampage would only result in one outcome—death.</p>
<p>He was counting the time. As long as he waited for Xiao to self-destruct, he would activate the Chaos Egg to forcefully block the energy of the self-destruction. He would then clinch the final victory.</p>
<p>In the Holy Land, Holy God also looked at the Cube’s countdown. At the same time, he stared at Xiao.</p>
<p>If Xiao could kill Human Sovereign before the countdown ended, he could stop Xiao’s self-destruction. Otherwise, he could only let Xiao die.</p>
<p>However, it was probably impossible for Xiao to kill Human Sovereign before the Cube’s countdown based on the present situation.</p>
<p>Forget it. It’s his fate. With only two seconds left on the countdown, Holy God was unwilling to wait any longer. Furthermore, he didn’t wish for any accidents to happen. He was just one thought short of detonating Xiao.</p>
<p>In the Venusian dimensional zone, the light on Xiao’s body had already materialized. Zhou Wen felt his strength instantly swell and knew that it was time. Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon the Chaos Egg to withstand it, an unexpected change happened.</p>
<p>Xiao’s power came from his Guardian armor. As for the Guardian armor, it had advanced to the Calamity grade because it had fused with Holy God’s avatar.</p>
<p>In theory, Xiao was only at the Epic stage. With the Guardian armor being controlled by the Holy God, he couldn’t escape the Guardian armor.</p>
<p>This was because his strength was too weak. The Guardian armor was the foundation of his strength.</p>
<p>However, just as the Guardian armor was about to explode, the Guardian armor on Xiao’s body seemed to be teleported out and instantly vanished.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen had been paying attention to Xiao, the intense Holy Light was unable to affect his Truth Listener and Great Brahma. Therefore, he could clearly see Xiao’s true body appear after the Guardian armor on his body vanished, but he didn’t see his true appearance.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a white armor enveloped his body. A red cape fluttered in the wind as he held a huge sword behind him, crossed with a Gatling.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although it only took an instant for the figure to rush into the maze, Zhou Wen knew very well who the figure belonged to.</p>
<p>How could it be him! Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>The figure was clearly An Tianzuo. Apart from him, no one had such strange armor or weapons. It looked like a soul or Guardian, but it was neither.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Xiao’s Guardian armor had already been detonated by Holy God, but when he saw the Guardian armor and An Tianzuo’s figure, Holy God immediately seemed to understand something. His expression changed drastically as his figure flashed.</p>
<p>Xiao’s Guardian had fused with his avatar. The moment the Guardian was teleported away, he had already sensed its location. It was actually in the Holy Land, where Xiao lived. It was also the residence of the Saints.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When Holy God arrived, the Guardian armor had already exploded. Energy was blooming like fireworks.</p>
<p>Holy God stood in Xiao’s room and saw the imprisoned Xiao enveloped by the exploded Guardian armor. His body was instantly destroyed by the immense energy impact of the Guardian armor. The flesh and blood on his skin rapidly melted away in the explosion.</p>
<p>Holy God’s eyes narrowed as time seemed to freeze. The fragments on the ground and bed that had been blasted apart froze in midair.</p>
<p>Holy God walked in front of Xiao, who was undergoing the explosion. He reached out and pressed his hand on the Guardian armor that was exploding. Then, with a casual flick of his hand, the Guardian armor, along with all the energy produced by the explosion, were thrown into the void.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the void, a terrifying explosion was like the final brilliance of a supernova-destruction, illuminating the void for an instant.</p>
<p>Holy God looked at Xiao, who was no longer in human shape. Instead, he looked like a bloody person that had been skinned. A trace of anger couldn’t help but flash in his eyes.</p>
<p>He hadn’t discovered that Xiao was being impersonated by An Tianzuo and had been screwed over. Thankfully, he had rushed over in time at the final moment. Otherwise, not only would Xiao have died, but all the Saints here would have died with him.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Holy God knew very well that the Guardian was Xiao’s to begin with. The imprisoned Xiao had definitely been trying to summon his Guardian back. Therefore, An Tianzuo could use Xiao to transfer the Guardian back. Otherwise, no matter how capable he was, it would be impossible for him to teleport the Guardian that was about to explode.</p>
<p>The unskinned Xiao, who was covered in blood, squirmed like a worm. The strange sounds coming from his ruptured throat weren’t just filled with pain, but also infinite hatred.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo sure taught me a lesson. Holy God glanced at Xiao, who was curled up on the ground like a worm as he constantly convulsed in pain. His eyes gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>Xiao—who had seemed to have a layer of himself shaved off—was like a skeleton that was covered in blood and chunks of flesh. The pain he felt was unimaginable to humans.</p>
<p>“Do you want revenge?” Holy God asked as he looked at Xiao, who was enduring inhuman pain.</p>
<p>Xiao’s neck was also mangled. His throat had already ruptured, preventing him from making a sound. He desperately opened his mouth, but no sound came out.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of death?” Holy God asked again.</p>
<p>Xiao’s mangled and trembling body tried his best to shake his head. However, his head was trembling terribly. It was difficult to even shake it. Just moving made his entire body ache to the core. Even so, he shook his head with all his might.</p>
<p>If not for Holy God’s fast reaction and unimaginable abilities that were beyond human imagination, he would have been a dead person.</p>
<p>“Then hand your life to me. Only then can you obtain the power to kill your enemy..” Holy God extended his hand in front of Xiao.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1432'>Chapter 1432: Eternal Carving on Venus</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The light on the screen suddenly vanished when the sword beam reached its maximum intensity. The humans watching the battle couldn’t adapt to the sudden change in brightness. They took a second to recover their vision.</p>
<p>The scene displayed on the Cube’s screen remained on the area in front of the Golden Palace. However, at that moment, only Human Sovereign stood in front of the Golden Palace with his sword in hand. Xiao was gone; his whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>Before people could figure out what had happened, whether Human Sovereign had won or not, and where Xiao had gone, the Cube’s countdown came to an end.</p>
<p>The Golden Palace’s door opened as a golden beam instantly shot out almost at the same time.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The power of the golden beam reached an unimaginable level as the entire Golden Palace exploded from the golden beam in an instant, turning into countless flying fragments.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Golden Palace. All the dimensional zones on Venus exploded as golden beams shot into the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to teleport away, but before he could use his teleportation ability, the golden beam had already struck him.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen was completely occupied by the golden light. Then, there was the sound of a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen gradually pulled out from the Venusian dimensional zone. It slowly retreated all the way until the golden blast of light shrank to a point where it couldn’t occupy the entire screen.</p>
<p>Only then could people finally see something. Venus was emitting a terrifying glow, like a huge ball-shaped firework that was spewing energy.</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen was struck by the beam, he believed that he was doomed.</p>
<p>Such terrifying energy was even more terrifying than Xiao’s Calamity Guardian’s self-destruction. Even the Chaos Egg might not be able to withstand it, much less him who had yet to summon it.</p>
<p>Yet, Zhou Wen’s body wasn’t injured despite being bathed in the golden beam. The beam’s energy seemed to have its own consciousness as it drilled into the metal ball Zhou Wen had just obtained.</p>
<p>This is the prelude to Venusian Companion Beast’s birth! Zhou Wen immediately understood what had happened.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Venusian Companion Beast had already chosen him as its master. It was now entering his metal ball.</p>
<p>I wonder if the other metal ball still has any use? Zhou Wen recalled that he still had another metal ball. He had obtained it with his identity as Zhou Wen before putting it into the chaos space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and took out the metal ball. After all, he had heard that all metal balls could hatch Companion Beasts. It apparently needed energy infusion before it could become a true Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Even if this metal ball couldn’t become a true Venusian Companion Beast, it could still receive some remnant energy and hatch an ordinary Companion Beast.</p>
<p>To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen took out the metal ball, the golden energy that had surged into the other metal ball split into two and injected into the two metal balls.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the scene inside the Cube as Venus constantly spewed out beams of light. There was a sudden boom after a while. The terrifying explosion made their eardrums seem to split open. Many people became deaf temporarily. As for the Cube, it was completely occupied by the golden light produced by the explosion. No one could see anything.</p>
<p>Even without looking at the Cube’s screen, a golden beam of light appeared in the real sky, illuminating the night sky.</p>
<p>After a while, the light in the sky vanished. The Cube’s screen gradually returned to normal. Everyone looked at the screen and realized that Venus was still the same Venus. It didn’t seem to have changed much.</p>
<p>However, when the camera angle in the Cube gradually spun, people saw an unbelievable scene. On the other side of Venus, half the planet had been blasted apart—only half of Venus was left. The other half was riddled with holes like the scene of an apocalypse.</p>
<p>That was all for the Cube as it returned to the ranking board.</p>
<p>The last name lit up like golden flames. It then gradually vanished before returning to nothingness.</p>
<p>The penultimate name lit up next. One after another, the names on the rankings constantly vanished. Finally, when Saint Xiao’s name vanished, only Human Sovereign was left in first place.</p>
<p>The name of Human Sovereign lit up as well, but it didn’t disappear like the other names. It instead grew brighter and bigger before finally occupying the entire screen.</p>
<p>Human Sovereign’s figure appeared on the screen amidst the light.</p>
<p>After that, scenes of Human Sovereign clearing the level appeared. There was also the battle with Xiao. It was also a fast scroll through.</p>
<p>The Cube’s camera gradually zoomed out as the various scenes of Human Sovereign played. The scenes became smaller and smaller until only Human Sovereign’s two golden shimmering names were left.</p>
<p>This name also gradually shrank. At that moment, people realized that the location of the word “Human Sovereign” was within a massive and complicated star chart. The shiny words “Human Sovereign” were placed where Venus was—the name permanently marked on Venus.</p>
<p>The Cube stopped showing any more scenes. The star chart vanished and the screen gradually returned to darkness. Finally, the Cube turned completely black and no longer showed any reaction.</p>
<p>“So Human Sovereign obtained first place after all?”</p>
<p>“That’s no other way about it. Xiao ultimately failed to stop Human Sovereign. My Human Sovereign is indeed invincible.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I knew it. Human Sovereign won’t be defeated.”</p>
<p>“Could Xiao have been killed by Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“Most likely. Otherwise, how could Human Sovereign obtain first place?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, will the name Human Sovereign forever represent Venus in the future? This is interesting.”</p>
<p>“In that case, does every planet have something similar? Will we have a chance to mark our names on other stars and planets in the future?”</p>
<p>“Dream on. Even if that’s the case, it won’t be your turn.”</p>
<p>As people discussed, Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>He floated in the void and looked at the remaining half of Venus. He thought that if Earth’s Companion Beast were to appear in the future, no one on Earth would be spared.</p>
<p>I definitely can’t let Earth’s Companion Beast appear. This was the only thought Zhou Wen had.</p>
<p>If Earth was really like Venus, how many people on Earth could survive? It was probably less than ten in a billion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held two metal balls that had already transformed into Companion Eggs. Just as he was about to use his phone to see what attributes the two Companion Eggs had, he suddenly saw a galactic behemoth approaching from afar.</p>
<p>The galactic behemoth’s body was transparent as blue light shimmered within.. It was the one Zhou Wen had seen with Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1433'>Chapter 1433: Venusian Companion Beast</h3>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Leave quickly.” Tsukuyomi’s figure appeared beside Zhou Wen. Without any explanation, she grabbed Zhou Wen and left using spatial teleportation. In the blink of an eye, they returned to the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>“What were you waiting for? If I were any later and you ended up trapped by its Calamity Zone, you wouldn’t even have the chance to escape. You could only wait for death when that happened,” Tsukuyomi said as she rolled her eyes at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Ahem, I just didn’t expect it to appear there,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you that a Calamity creature needs immense energy to advance? It’s naturally no exception. Were you even listening?” Tsukuyomi said angrily.</p>
<p>“Since it wants it, shouldn’t it be challenging the Venusian dimensional zone itself? With its strength, it shouldn’t be difficult to obtain first place, right?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“It does, but it’s a Companion Beast. Do you think a Venusian Companion Beast will give itself to Companion Beasts from other planets?” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a nerd.</p>
<p>“So there’s such a restriction.” Only then did Zhou Wen realize that wild Companion Beasts couldn’t obtain planetary Companion Beasts. Therefore, the galactic behemoth was camping near Venus, waiting for someone to take it out.</p>
<p>“Go back. As long as you return to Earth, you will be safe. No Calamity creature can enter Earth without being punished. The cosmos is too dangerous. It’s not suitable for you,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“How about you? Did you gain anything?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“I didn’t gain much, but at least I won’t starve to death,” Tsukuyomi said casually.</p>
<p>“That’s good. This is for you.” Zhou Wen took out a Companion Egg and handed it to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“Why are you giving me this?” Tsukuyomi took the Companion Egg and curled her lips. “You are too insincere. If you really want to thank me, shouldn’t you give me the Venusian Companion Egg you just obtained? What’s the use of giving me a Metal Guard Companion Egg? Don’t tell me you think this thing can fill my stomach?”</p>
<p>“Take it with you,” Zhou Wen said before getting up to teleport back to Earth.</p>
<p>He had exchanged his life for the Venusian Companion Egg, so how could he give it away so easily? Zhou Wen had left a spatial mark on the Metal Guard Companion Egg. If Tsukuyomi needed him in the future, he could directly reach her.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After returning to Luoyang, Zhou Wen got An Sheng over.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could ask, An Sheng said, “Young Master, Overseer is back.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, No doubt about it; he was definitely the one impersonating Xiao.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo hadn’t held back in the previous battle. Zhou Wen could sense that he had used all his strength. This made Zhou Wen suspect that An Tianzuo was taking the opportunity to finish him.</p>
<p>As though he had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts, An Sheng hurriedly whispered, “Young Master, Overseer said that if you hadn’t fought with all your might, you wouldn’t have been able to fool the person in the Holy Land. However, he believed that you would definitely be able to hold out.”</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t, would he have just slaughtered me?” Zhou Wen said coldly.</p>
<p>“Definitely not. Overseer knows his limits,” An Sheng hurriedly said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Who knows what his limits are. Perhaps his limits are to kill me.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that if An Tianzuo had intended to eliminate him, he would have had plenty of opportunities when he first came to Luoyang to study. He wouldn’t have waited until now.</p>
<p>Just as An Sheng was about to say something, Zhou Wen added, “By the way, do you know the expert who forged the Essence Gold weapons?”</p>
<p>“Our An family has many blacksmiths. A few of them have pretty good skills. Young Master, do you want to forge an Essence Gold weapon?” An Sheng asked curiously.</p>
<p>“My Bamboo Blade has shattered. I’ve brought back the fragments and scabbard. See if you can think of a way to recover or reforge them.” Zhou Wen handed the Bamboo Blade’s fragments and scabbard to An Sheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was used to using the Bamboo Blade. Furthermore, the Bamboo Blade had a Jinxes Master effect. It should be of some use against powers like blessing. Zhou Wen wanted to see if it could be restored.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it can’t be restored now that it’s shattered to such a state. I can only try to reforge it,” An Sheng said as he looked at the shards.</p>
<p>“Then reforge it.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Bamboo Blade would still have any Jinxes Master effect after reforging it. However, he still wanted to carry a weapon that he was used to.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll take all of these pieces back and let the masters study them. I’m not sure yet, but it shouldn’t take long.” An Sheng put away the fragments and scabbard.</p>
<p>“I’m not in a rush to use it. Do it slowly. It’s best if it can be recovered to its original state,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll get them to try their best to find the original blueprint of Bamboo Blade and reforge it according to it.” With that said, An Sheng left with the fragments.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and had just taken out the Venusian Companion Egg when he saw the antelope and Chick run over and stare intently at the Venusian Companion Egg in his hand.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen hurriedly stored the Companion Egg away into the Companion Egg and looked warily at the antelope.</p>
<p>“Look at you. Isn’t it just a Venusian Companion Egg? Who would snatch it from you?” The antelope curled its lips and said disdainfully, “I’m just here to see what the Companion Egg can hatch.”</p>
<p>“I see. That’s easy. I’ll show you when I hatch it.” Zhou Wen took out the Venusian Companion Egg again.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The antelope charged over like a phantom and opened its mouth to bite the Companion Egg. Zhou Wen was already prepared as he retracted his palm and quickly retreated, causing the antelope to miss.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” Zhou Wen mocked the antelope.</p>
<p>The antelope showed no embarrassment at all as it said without a blush, “Give me the Companion Egg. I’ll take you to Mount Laojun to retrieve the treasure. The treasures there are much better than this Companion Egg.”</p>
<p>“Go get it yourself. I’m not interested.” Zhou Wen teleported to the Moon with the Venusian Companion Egg without giving the antelope a chance.</p>
<p>Without heading to Lady Supreme Yin’s place, he used his phone to scan the Venusian Companion Egg in an uninhabited spot.</p>

<p>Companion Form: Shear (Yin)</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with these stats. It was born at the Calamity grade. Although it was only at the Human Realm, it was enough for him. Now that he had a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, there was no need for him to risk his life the next time he encountered a Calamity-grade opponent.</p>
<p>The only surprise was that this thing’s companion form wasn’t a gun. From the creatures in the Venusian dimensional zone, Zhou Wen imagined that it would be a gun.</p>
<p>He took out the other Venusian Companion Egg and was immediately alarmed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1434'>Chapter 1434: Yin Yang Wyrms</h3>
<p>Golden Wyrm: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Metal Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Gold Essence</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Love is Stronger than Gold.</p>
<p>Terror Form: Yang Blade (S-grade)</p>

<p>Strength: 100</p>
<p>Speed: 100</p>

<p>Essence Energy: 100</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Midas Touch, Strangle, Unstoppable, Dominance Body</p>
<p>Companion Form: Shear (Yang)</p>
<p>The stats and skills of the two Companion Beasts were the same. However, the first one’s Terror transformation was Yin Blade. The companion form was also a Yin attribute, and this one’s Terror transformation was Yang Blade. The companion form was a Yang attribute.</p>
<p>They were clearly Companion Beasts born from the same energy. One was of the Yin attribute, while the other was of the Yang attribute. Zhou Wen really didn’t understand how it was split.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Wen had the Companion Beasts on hand, so he couldn’t be bothered to think through it. He hatched the Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Calamity-grade Companion Beasts were potent. Zhou Wen felt the Essence Energy in his body surge into the Companion Egg as though a dam had been breached. If Zhou Wen didn’t have Slaughterer’s massive amounts of Essence Energy to support him, he would have been sucked dry if he were an ordinary Terror-grade entity.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen suspected that if the energy in Venus hadn’t split into two and injected into the two metal balls, he would have been sucked dry.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing like that happened. The Companion Egg had its fill of Essence Energy after a while and transformed into Golden Wyrm beams that condensed on Zhou Wen’s right finger.</p>
<p>Soon, a metal-colored wyrm tattoo appeared on Zhou Wen’s middle finger on his right hand. After a moment of shimmering light, it gradually hid under his skin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hatched the other Yin-elemental Golden Wyrm Companion Egg. Before long, a metallic wyrm tattoo wrapped around his right hand’s index finger. It shimmered for a while before gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>With a thought, two Golden Wyrms appeared over his fingers, transforming into gold-like wyrms that tore out of his fingers and danced in the air.</p>
<p>The two Golden Wyrms weren’t bodies of flesh and blood, but of gold. Their whiskers, scales, claws, and bodies were all golden in color, but they only looked like gold. It wasn’t really gold. Their density far exceeded gold, and their hardness and toughness also far exceeded gold.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. The two Golden Wyrms instantly transformed into two strange golden weapons that landed in Zhou Wen’s hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the weapons and carefully sized them up. The Shears were really strange. They were four feet long and looked like a wyrm-shaped blade. It was wide at the front and narrow at the back. The wyrm’s head was the blade’s head, and its tail was curved into a bracer.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it was somewhat similar to a rapier, but there was a huge difference. After all, it was a saber, not a sword. Furthermore, the handle and blade were at a very strange angle. When Zhou Wen held the blade, he felt that the angle of the blade was a little wrong.</p>
<p>Why does this look a little familiar? The more Zhou Wen looked at the two Shears, the more familiar they looked. With a thought, he overlapped the two Shears and immediately shouted, “Holy sh*t, isn’t this a pair of scissors?”</p>
<p>When the two Shears were stacked together, they looked like scissors with long blades. However, because there was no fixed pivoting spot in the middle, they couldn’t be used as real scissors.</p>
<p>Although it looks a little ugly, it’s fine as long as it’s useful. Zhou Wen turned on his phone, having had the intention of testing the might of the Golden Wyrm scissors in a dungeon.</p>
<p>However, before he could open the dungeon, a notification popped up on his phone.</p>
<p>“Discovered reproductive Companion Beast. Proceed with Birth?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tapped it open and realized that the Companion Beasts that his phone had upgraded were the Golden Wyrms. Their Birth criterion was the other Golden Wyrm, and their Yin and Yang attributes matched perfectly.</p>
<p>That works too! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he clicked on Birth without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Back when Light Concealment and Night Immaculate gave birth to Shadow Concealment, it was a Companion Beast of the same level. Now that two Golden Wyrms were reproducing, they would definitely give birth to a Calamity-grade Companion Beast. Wouldn’t that mean he would have another Calamity-grade Companion Beast?</p>
<p>Give birth. You must give birth. It’s best if you produce a few more. Zhou Wen watched as the two Golden Wyrms entered their Birth states. Since the progress bar didn’t show any movement, he temporarily ignored them. He just needed to wait for a Calamity Companion Beast to be born, and he could lead a group of Calamity Companion Beasts to crush the various dungeons. He might even have a chance of killing the four Mo family generals at Chess Mountain.</p>
<p>The four Calamity-grade fellows were really difficult to deal with, especially the Demonized General that Zhou Wen had once stolen the pearl from. The Chaos Umbrella was terrifyingly powerful. Even the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation would be destroyed, so Zhou Wen had no chance.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was waiting for the Soul Mirror and the Golden Wyrm to be done before he killed the four Demonized Generals.</p>
<p>Since he was here on the moon, Zhou Wen decided to visit Wang Chan.</p>
<p>When Wang Chan saw him, she was covered in tears. She strongly requested Zhou Wen to take her back to the Wang family. Zhou Wen coaxed her repeatedly before she reluctantly agreed to stay longer.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin told Zhou Wen that Wang Chan’s power of misfortune could only be effectively controlled after she reached the Calamity grade. However, it was almost impossible for humans to advance to the Calamity grade, so they had to make a choice.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin believed that it was best to use the Mythical Serum or Spirit Casting. Contracting a Guardian was the worst choice.</p>
<p>However, the Mythical Serum needed to be created using dimensional creatures with the attribute of misfortune. The Guardians used for Spirit Casting also had the same requirements. It was really difficult to find one.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin couldn’t leave the moon, so this task naturally landed on Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to figure out where to find high-level dimensional creatures and Guardians with the attributes of misfortune.</p>
<p>According to Lady Supreme Yin, the creature of misfortune couldn’t be too high or too low a level. It was best if it was at the Mythical stage, but it had to have immense potential.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his head ache when he heard those requirements.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In Luoyang’s An family’s weapon factory, An Sheng and a few Essence Gold forgers were looking at the blueprint of the Bamboo Blade and studying how to reforge it.</p>
<p>Although the Bamboo Blade was also made of Essence Gold, the Essence Gold used by the Bamboo Blade wasn’t ordinary Essence Gold, but a type of Refined Essence Gold produced from a particular type of Essence Gold mine.</p>
<p>It was impossible for ordinary Essence Gold to reach such hardness, nor could it be used in high-intensity battles.</p>
<p>The biggest problem now was that it wasn’t easy to melt the Bamboo Blade’s fragments. It was said that when smelting the materials of the Four Gentlemen Blades in the past, the blacksmith had taken the risk to enter a dimensional zone and used the Earth fire in the dimensional zone to melt the Refined Essence Gold.</p>
<p>As they couldn’t find the blacksmith who forged Bamboo Blade, nor did they know where the Earth fire he had used came from, they could only think of other ways to melt it.</p>
<p>A few blacksmiths tried several methods, but they failed to completely melt the Bamboo Blade fragments. Ordinary Essence Gold forging methods were definitely impossible. They could only report the matter to An Sheng and get him to think of a solution.</p>
<p>“If the temperature of the flames isn’t high enough, I have a solution.” An Sheng thought of Chick. That fellow was a descendant of a phoenix. When it came to fire, there weren’t many fires in this world that were stronger than phoenix flames.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1435'>Chapter 1435: Reforging Materials</h3>
<p>After An Sheng discussed with the blacksmiths, he planned on returning to Overseer Manor and borrow Chick. He wanted it to spew out some fire to melt the Refined Essence Gold.</p>
<p>However, before An Sheng could find Chick, he was summoned by An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“There’s been so much to deal with recently. Yet, you aren’t focusing on work and instead spend all your time at the weapons factory?” An Tianzuo said with a frown.</p>
<p>An Sheng was afraid that An Tianzuo would be displeased if he knew that he had gotten the few blacksmiths with the best skills to help Zhou Wen forge the saber. Therefore, he said, “The effects of the Essence Gold bullets recently developed by the weapons factory can’t keep up with the evolution speed of dimensional creatures. I just want to see if there’s a way to modify the bullets to improve their effects.”</p>
<p>“And what solution have you come up with?” An Tianzuo said as he read some documents.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little difficult. Just pure Essence Gold bullets alone results in great expenditure. Our production of Essence Gold is far from enough. Since using Essence Gold bullets like now while the effects aren’t too good, I’ve been wondering if there are any other materials that are compatible with Essence Gold. Creating an Essence alloy can reduce the quantity of Essence Gold used and guarantee the quality of the bullets.” An Sheng had been considering this problem all this while.</p>
<p>Using pure Essence Gold for the bullet had good effects, but the An family didn’t have that much Essence Gold reserves. It was too extravagant.</p>
<p>However, the laboratory in the weapons factory had tried many materials. The compatibility between ordinary metal and Essence Gold wasn’t high. It wasn’t even of any help. The only thing that worked was the Essence Gold plating.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible to develop an alloy that had an effect equivalent to pure Essence Gold.</p>
<p>“Then what material do you plan on using to make the alloy?” An Tianzuo continued asking without looking up.</p>
<p>“We haven’t found any suitable materials for the time being. The best candidates for the alloy are the bodies of metal-type dimensional creatures…” An Sheng was somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>“I have a material here. Study it and see if it’s compatible with Essence Gold.” An Tianzuo took out a long, flat box from beside his chair and casually placed it on the table. Then, he said casually, “There’s a problem with the origins of this material. It mustn’t be exposed to the public. See if we can make it into an alloy or forge it into a weapon. If it doesn’t work, destroy it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer.” An Sheng was somewhat curious. He wanted to open the box to see what material it was.</p>
<p>“Take it back before taking a look. Don’t disturb me while I’m working here. You have to quickly settle the matter I instructed you to do. If you delay your work, scram to Chess Mountain to guard it,” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I will have it done.” An Sheng didn’t dare stare any further. He picked up the box and walked out.</p>
<p>After leaving An Tianzuo’s office, An Sheng dashed into a meeting room and closed the door and windows. Only then did he open the box to see what material was inside.</p>
<p>When the box opened, An Sheng saw what was inside and was immediately taken aback.</p>
<p>Inside the box was a silver rapier.</p>
<p>Isn’t… Isn’t this the rapier that remained undamaged in the battle with the Immortal Culling Sword? An Sheng reacted and carefully sized up the rapier in surprise.</p>
<p>The silver rapier looked narrow and thin, but it didn’t feel light when he weighed it in his hand. It could even be said to be very heavy. It was a little cold to the touch, like silver made of ice.</p>
<p>On the blade, there were many tiny holes. The small ones were like needles, while the big ones were the size of rice grains.</p>
<p>There’s no mistake about it. It’s definitely that rapier. These holes should have been left behind from the battle with the Immortal Culling Sword. Although it suffered some damage, to be able to resist an existence like the Immortal Culling Sword, the material of this sword is unimaginable. It’s a pity to destroy such a sword even if it can’t be exposed… An Sheng’s eyes suddenly lit up as though he had understood something. He hurriedly stored the rapier back into the box, picked it up, and rushed to the weapon factory.</p>
<p>The rapier was made of the Holy Temple’s cornerstone, Holy Metal. Not any random Holy Temple cornerstone was called Holy Metal. In fact, the so-called Holy Metal was the bedrock of a Holy Temple and also a core component. If the bedrock of the Holy Temple was destroyed, it would no longer have the foundation to be a Holy Temple again.</p>
<p>The cornerstone Holy Metal was very strong. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been used as a bedrock. Furthermore, after being baptized by the power of the Holy Temple, the cornerstone Holy Metal was considered top-notch. Even Calamity-grade creatures could hardly damage it.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword only left a few notches in it, a testament to how powerful this material was.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how strong the material was, it was only a dead sword. It didn’t have its own consciousness, nor did it have any energy augmentation effects. It was just that the material was stronger.</p>
<p>Holy God gave the sword to Xiao to fend off the sharpness of the Immortal Culling Sword. The power used in combat was still thanks to the Guardian.</p>
<p>Even so, the cornerstone Holy Metal was a top-notch material. How could he throw it away?</p>
<p>An Sheng was smart. After seeing the rapier, he understood what An Tianzuo meant.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Overseer already knows that I’m helping Young Master Wen repair the Bamboo Blade. That’s why he produced this rapier. I wonder how compatible this material is with Essence Gold Essence. If the combination of the two materials isn’t suitable for forging a weapon, wouldn’t I be letting down Overseer’s intentions? No, I have to think of a way to forge it into a weapon… After An Sheng thought it through, he turned around and returned to Overseer Manor to find Chick.</p>
<p>Refined Essence Gold Essence was difficult to melt without Chick. Needless to say for this rapier—it was a material that even the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t slice through.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned from the Moon, he tried to figure out where he could obtain a misfortune dimensional creature or find a misfortune-type Guardian.</p>
<p>It wasn’t viable to keep Wang Chan on the Moon the entire time. He had to resolve this problem sooner or later.</p>
<p>As he could teleport, he could travel to Earth’s four districts in a short period of time. Furthermore, An Tianzuo had already returned, so he didn’t need to stay in Luoyang forever.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen studied the dungeons in the various districts and discovered dimensional creatures that were suspected to have powers of misfortune.</p>
<p>However, there weren’t many of such dimensional creatures to begin with. They needed to be at the Mythical stage and have great potential. Zhou Wen searched around and studied them for a long time, but he still couldn’t make any confirmation.</p>
<p>He had a few targets, but he could only take a look to see if they met Lady Supreme Yin’s requirements.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose from among the few targets and finally chose to head to the Pandora Palace dimensional zone in the West District. There were a few dimensional creatures there that were suspected to have the power of misfortune.</p>
<p>As it wasn’t too dangerous this time, Zhou Wen took Ya’er along as a vacation for her.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1436'>Chapter 1436: Frustration</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Inside the Holy Land, Holy God dragged Xiao’s severely injured body with both hands and walked down the stone steps towards the abyss.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The abyss was bottomless and there was only endless darkness. The more Holy God walked down, the more intense the darkness around him became. It was as though the stone steps would suck everything dry. All light would vanish without a trace.</p>
<p>If not for the Holy Light emitted from Holy God’s body, he probably wouldn’t be able to see fingers even if he placed his hand in front of him.</p>
<p>Even someone as powerful as Holy God could only illuminate an area three feet around him.</p>
<p>As it was too dark, he couldn’t see the surrounding mountain walls at all. He didn’t know if there was anything else beside him. Only the steps beneath Holy God’s feet could be seen. Due to the Holy Light, he could still make out some blurry shadows.</p>
<p>Finally, even the Holy Light over Holy God’s body was devoured by the darkness. The surroundings were as dark as the world of the dead.</p>
<p>After an unknown period of time, Holy God arrived in front of a lake.</p>
<p>The surroundings remained dark, but the water in the lake emitted a crystalline glow, like diamonds glowing in the darkness.</p>
<p>“After walking into the lake, you might be reborn and have the power to defeat the enemy,” Holy God said calmly as he placed Xiao’s body by the lake.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Xiao was still skinned and covered in blood. His injuries hadn’t healed.</p>
<p>Struggling to his feet, Xiao walked towards the lake without a word.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know what that lake is?” Holy God suddenly said.</p>
<p>“I just need to know that this place has the strength I need to defeat An Tianzuo for revenge.” The wounds around Xiao’s throat had healed significantly. Although his voice was still hoarse and ear-piercing, he could already speak.</p>
<p>“Dimensional creatures are unable to gain a foothold on Earth. Any dimensional creature that comes to Earth will be suppressed by Earth’s rules. Even invincible powerhouses at the Apocalypse grade are no exception. Therefore, any dimensional creature that wishes to descend must use the bodies of Earth’s native creatures to retain a portion of their combat strength.”</p>
<p>Holy God paused for a moment before continuing, “However, a dimensional powerhouse later discovered a place. There, he was actually able to use his strength freely without being suppressed by the rules of Earth.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the Holy Land?” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, there was no Holy Land, only a lake.” Holy God continued, “Within a certain range of the lake, the powers of dimensional creatures will no longer be suppressed. However, once they are far from the lake, the suppression of Earth’s nomological powers will appear again. Therefore, that dimensional powerhouse did some research, hoping to use the water in the lake to help dimensional creatures completely escape the suppression of Earth’s rules.</p>
<p>“However, any dimensional creature that came into contact with the lake, no matter how powerful they were, melted into the lake like snowflakes. After that, the powerhouse experimented on many dimensional creatures and Earth’s native creatures. The outcome was surprising. None of the powerful dimensional creatures could withstand the power of the lake, but Earth’s native creatures weren’t affected. To you humans, this terrifying lake is no different from ordinary lake water. It doesn’t cause any harm to your bodies.”</p>
<p>Xiao only listened quietly without interrupting Holy God.</p>
<p>Holy God looked at the lake and continued, “However, the native creatures of Earth that entered the lake died one after another. None of them returned alive.”</p>
<p>“Why? Didn’t you say that there’s a power here that can allow me to exact revenge?” Xiao turned around and questioned Holy God with an ear-piercing voice.</p>
<p>“Later, that powerhouse checked many human historical resources and myths and finally learned that this lake is called Frustration,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“Frustration? I’ve never heard of such a lake in myths and legends in any district,” Xiao said after some thought.</p>
<p>“You might not have heard of this lake, but you must have heard of the other side of the lake.” Holy God looked into the distance.</p>
<p>Xiao couldn’t see anything since his eyes were destroyed. All he could do was ask, “What’s the other side?”</p>
<p>“Paramita.” Holy God’s answer left Xiao alarmed.</p>
<p>“This lake leads to the Paramita?” Xiao was pleasantly surprised. He knew what the word “Paramita” meant. “The Paramita that treats life and death as one bank and nirvana as the other, the place to attain boundless merit and wisdom by abandoning all frustrations?”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“This is just a guess. No one knows if the other side of the lake is Paramita because no one has ever reached it. Although this lake is small, even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses can’t reach the other side. Only by swimming through the lake can one reach the other side. However, no creature that has entered the lake has returned alive.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s the point of me entering the lake?” Xiao asked.</p>
<p>“I once saw a person who had absolutely no chance of living swim across Lake Frustration and reach the other bank alive. Furthermore, as a human which makes it impossible for him to advance to the Mythical stage, he actually broke the restrictions and advanced to the Mythical stage with a pure human body,” Holy God said calmly.</p>
<p>“Who is he? What happened in the end?” Xiao asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know this. All you need to know is that it’s very difficult for you to completely recover from your injuries. Even if you don’t die, you will only be a cripple in the future. There are only two paths placed in front of you now. Swim to Paramita across Lake Frustration and be reborn, or…”</p>
<p>Before Holy God could finish his sentence, Xiao had already jumped into the lake.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the lake looked clear and transparent, like a flawless crystal. One could clearly see the bottom of the lake. It wasn’t too deep.</p>
<p>However, after Xiao jumped in, no matter how hard he struggled, his body couldn’t float above the water surface as he kept sinking.</p>
<p>It looked like the lake had no buoyancy at all. No, it should be said that not only was there no buoyancy, but it was also like an abyss with a terrifying suction force that constantly pulled Xiao down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no matter how Xiao struggled, the lake remained calm. There was no sound of water splashing. It was dead silent.</p>
<p>“It’s really not a good habit to not wait for someone to finish their sentence.” Holy God looked at Xiao, who was constantly sinking in the lake, and muttered to himself, “Even Calamity-grade Earthlings will be entangled by countless invisible wraiths when they enter the lake. They will be pulled to the bottom of the lake and eventually perish to become a part of the lake. Over the years, only one person reached the opposite bank. There are no less than a hundred thousand creatures that drowned.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had planned on traveling with Ya’er in the West District, but after Li Xuan learned of this, he offered to follow him.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, I heard that an extremely popular female host lives in this city.” Li Xuan drooled as he looked around.</p>
<p>“Which female host?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“The one that hosts the program with Professor Gu. Her name’s Su Yi. She’s crazy popular now..” Li Xuan kept looking around as though he was looking for something.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1437'>Chapter 1437: Rumors</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>There weren’t many pedestrians on the streets. The mortality rate on Earth had been terrifyingly high in recent years, but the birth rate was pitifully low. Most human cities didn’t have many people now.</p>
<p>However, the population of this city was clearly abnormally low. Only one or two people would occasionally rush by such a large city.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was very disappointed. “I originally thought that with the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau’s headquarters here in New De City, it should be a rather lively and prosperous city. I never expected it to be so desolate.”</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a little abnormal. Before coming, I read the news on the Internet. There are still three to four million people in New De City. It’s impossible for there to be so few people. I wonder what happened.” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>“Just ask.” Li Xuan saw pedestrians passing by on the street in front of him. He flashed to a person and took out a large bill. He extended his hand and waved it in front of the person. “Why are there so few people in New De City? Tell me what happened here and this is yours.”</p>
<p>The person was immediately delighted as he reached out to grab the money in Li Xuan’s hand.</p>
<p>“Tell me first.” Li Xuan retracted his hand, causing the person to miss.</p>
<p>“Most people have moved to New Horse City. The remaining population in New De City isn’t even a tenth of what it originally was,” the person said as he stared at the money in Li Xuan’s hand.</p>
<p>“Why are people moving?” Li Xuan continued asking.</p>
<p>“It’s all because of the rumors.” The person said something that left Zhou Wen and Li Xuan somewhat surprised. This matter was related to Pandora’s Magic Palace.</p>
<p>In the myths and legends of the West District, Pandora was a beautiful woman created by god and was given to humans as a gift.</p>
<p>At the same time, the gods gave a magic box to her. Every god left a gift in the magic box.</p>
<p>After she arrived in the human world, Pandora was driven by curiosity and opened the magic box. However, the magic box didn’t have any real gifts. Instead, disasters, plagues, wars, and other curses flew out.</p>
<p>Terrified, Pandora hurriedly closed the magic box, but she locked up “hope” that Goddess Athena had left in the box.</p>
<p>From then on, the human world was filled with all sorts of calamities. Disasters, plagues, and illnesses ran rampant. War constantly broke out, and there was no peace.</p>
<p>It was said that Pandora’s Magic Palace was the residence of Pandora. However, no one had seen her before.</p>
<p>Someone had recently spread the news that Pandora had already appeared and would soon open the magic box. The nearby area would probably become a dead zone.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people from New De City moved to other human cities if they could do so. Most of them went to the nearby New Horse City and chose to watch the development from there.</p>
<p>After saying that, the person reached out and snatched the money. He turned around and ran. As he ran, he said, “You guys should leave quickly. There are only a few days left before Pandora opens the magic box.”</p>
<p>“I want to see what that woman looks like. I heard that the mythical version of Pandora is an extremely beautiful woman,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile, “Don’t do anything rash. From the myths and legends, it’s very likely that she’s a Calamity-grade existence. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be legends of all sorts of disasters.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather cautious in reality. Even if he already had the strength to fight a Calamity, a Calamity still had the possibility of killing him. It wasn’t worth risking his life.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to enter Pandora’s Magic Palace to take a look, but since there was such a development, Zhou Wen gave up on entering. After all, something would happen nine times out of ten he entered a dimensional zone in reality.</p>
<p>The circumstances made Zhou Wen even more afraid of entering.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen planned on heading to the periphery of Pandora’s Magic Palace to take a look. If he could find the tiny palm symbol, he would download the dungeon. If not, he didn’t plan on entering. After all, there were dimensional creatures suspected to be of the Misfortune attribute elsewhere. There was no need to be inflexible and stubborn.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was just saying. If Zhou Wen wasn’t entering, he didn’t really plan on taking the risk.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held Ya’er’s hand. When the three of them arrived near Magic Palace, they saw a program team filming at the entrance.</p>
<p>“It’s Su Yi!” Li Xuan’s eyes lit up when he saw the host.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traced his gaze and indeed, he saw the female host he often saw on television and on the Internet. Zhou Wen recognized her, but he didn’t know her name.</p>
<p>She looked even more beautiful in real life than on television. She had long brown hair and fair skin. Her facial features were well-defined and she looked charming. She had a femme fatale style and one could in no way describe her as quiet and demure.</p>
<p>As the program team was at the entrance, Zhou Wen and company stood far away without heading over. They wanted to wait for them to leave before heading over to prevent any trouble.</p>
<p>Free media like the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was very well-informed. Zhou Wen had previously been in the limelight on the Cube’s rankings. If they saw him, they would definitely come over to take pictures.</p>
<p>“It’s not convenient for you to go over. I’ll go take a look first. After all, I’m not a famous person.” Li Xuan informed Zhou Wen before walking towards the program team.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and saw that Magic Palace was built between two mountains. Only one side of the door was exposed. The other part was in the valley.</p>
<p>After observing from afar for a while, he discovered the tiny palm symbol on the stone wall beside the door.</p>
<p>There really is one. Zhou Wen was delighted. He planned on downloading the dungeon after the program team left. Then, he would figure out the situation in Magic Palace in-game before deciding if he should enter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned to look at Li Xuan and saw that he was having a good chat with Su Yi. It was unknown how he managed to hit on her.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Xuan walked over with Su Yi.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, let me do the introductions. This is the most popular female host in the Federation, Su Yi… Su Yi… This is my best friend…”</p>
<p>Before Li Xuan could finish his sentence, Su Yi took the initiative to say, “There’s probably no one in the Federation who doesn’t know you, am I right, Mr. Zhou? What’s more, we work in news. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Mr. Zhou, you are the pride of humanity.”</p>
<p>“Just call me Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen glanced at Li Xuan and blamed him for this. Why did he bring Su Yi over for no reason?</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, here’s the situation. I heard from Su Yi that it’s just a rumor that Pandora wants to open the magic box. They are now doing a program to dispel the rumors,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Rumors? Are you sure?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. If it was just a rumor, it was way too potent to make nearly the entire population in New De City leave.</p>
<p>Su Yi said, “Although we can’t be a hundred percent sure, nor do we know who spread the rumors, there are clearly traces of a mastermind and hype. It’s not news that came from the normal channels. Furthermore, we haven’t found the source of the news yet. Previously, we had companions enter Magic Palace to film the area, but we didn’t discover any abnormalities.”</p>
<p>“That’s odd.. What’s the benefit of creating such a rumor?” Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1438'>Chapter 1438: Entering the Crew</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“If the two of you wish to enter Magic Palace, will you be interested in joining our program team?” When Su Yi saw Zhou Wen frown, she immediately said, “Don’t worry. We are a professional media outlet. Without your permission, we won’t release any news related to you, nor will we take pictures or recordings.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen and from the look in his eyes, he knew that he wanted to go.</p>
<p>“Sorry, we just came by to take a look. We had no intention of entering.” Zhou Wen still rejected Su Yi.</p>
<p>Although the matter about the magic box’s opening being close at hand might only be a rumor, Zhou Wen still didn’t wish to take the risk. Furthermore, from his past experience, there was a high chance that something would happen if he entered a dimensional zone. If he followed the program team in, he might end up harming them.</p>
<p>Su Yi was deeply disappointed. “That’s such a pity. We still have to do some filming outside. If the two of you change your minds and wish to enter, you are welcome to join us at any time. I can be your guide. I know the interior of Magic Palace well.”</p>
<p>With that said, Su Yi bade farewell and returned to the program team. She didn’t try to persuade him further.</p>
<p>“We were planning on entering anyway. With such a beauty as a guide, why not? Why reject her?” Li Xuan was puzzled.</p>
<p>“I originally planned on entering, but now that there’s the matter regarding the magic box, it’s best to be careful. I’ll not enter for the time being.” Zhou Wen paused before smiling. “Besides, you can’t touch women, right? No matter how beautiful Su Yi is, it has nothing to do with you, right?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean I can’t touch women? That’s because I don’t fancy them, and have no intention of touching them. If I really find someone suitable, I’m up to it in any way that’s better than you,” Li Xuan shouted as he jumped.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you are up to it, but it’s best we don’t enter Magic Palace for the time being. Let’s walk around its surroundings.” Zhou Wen walked towards Magic Palace’s door.</p>
<p>Since Su Yi already knew of his presence, there was no need to hide. It was more important to download the dungeon.</p>
<p>Su Yi had already informed the production team. Although they could clearly sense that the production team had recognized Zhou Wen, no one came to disturb them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the door and took many pictures. He took the opportunity to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol and successfully entered the download screen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Xuan watched their filming. As he watched, he said regretfully, “It’s a pity not to join them when such a beautiful chick is willing to be our tour guide.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put away his phone and ignored Li Xuan. He looked at the filming crew. He was just taking a casual look when he realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The videographer who was filming Su Yi’s frontal shot seemed to be avoiding his gaze.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t obvious and it was normal for the videographer to have his face obstructed by the camera, Zhou Wen felt that his actions were a little awkward. Furthermore, the videographer gave him a familiar feeling.</p>
<p>After secretly using Truth Listener to observe for a while, Zhou Wen immediately discovered the problem. The videographer was Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Although he had changed his appearance and even his figure was a little different from before, Zhou Wen still recognized him. This was all thanks to his sharp senses.</p>
<p>If not for his sharp senses, he wouldn’t have been able to tell that it was Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun is a person who doesn’t do things without benefits. He changed his appearance and sneaked into the program team, but he’s deliberately hiding from me. What’s he up to? Zhou Wen suddenly thought. Could he be the one who spread the rumors of Magic Palace?</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. Liu Yun had sneaked into the program team because he wanted to enter Magic Palace.</p>
<p>However, there was something Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out. The Magic Palace wasn’t controlled by a large faction, so anyone could enter. If Liu Yun wanted to enter, he could have entered himself. Why did he have to sneak into the program team?</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s something in the program team that’s helpful to him? Zhou Wen carefully scanned everyone in the program team.</p>
<p>There were more than ten people in the program team. Apart from the host, director, camera crew, there were a few human experts who were in charge of clearing dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>The few human experts were at the Mythical stage. It was obvious that three of them had advanced using Mythical Serums. They had obvious dimensional creature characteristics and one had likely contracted a Guardian.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was also a special guest. In fact, he was Su Yi’s host partner. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this person. He was Professor Gu, who often partnered with Su Yi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched for a while but didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>What is Liu Yun plotting? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and suddenly said to Li Xuan, “Don’t you want to go in and take a look? Then tell Su Yi that we want to follow their program team in to take a look.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, it sure wasn’t easy. You’ve finally thought it through.” Li Xuan was overjoyed as he patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said, “That’s right. Life is only a short few decades. It’s only right to enjoy it in a timely fashion. It’s pointless thinking about all kinds of nonsense all day.”</p>
<p>“Are you going? If not, I’ll tell them myself,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t, let me do it. It’s not like you like dealing with people. Leave such troublesome matters to me.” Li Xuan ran to the program team.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Xuan walked over with Su Yi and another middle-aged man wearing a hat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen learned from Li Xuan’s introductions that the middle-aged man’s name was Evan—the director of this production team. He had agreed to let Zhou Wen and Li Xuan join the production team, but because they had filming work, they could only follow their designated path. They sometimes had to stop to film, making it impossible for them to have the freedom to constantly wander around.</p>
<p>After agreeing to these conditions, Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Ya’er officially joined the program team.</p>
<p>“Is this little girl going in too? Although the matter regarding the magic box is just a rumor, Magic Palace is rather dangerous. She’s still so young…” Su Yi said as she looked at Ya’er.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ll watch over her,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I was just overthinking things. With your strength, Mr. Zhou, it’s naturally impossible for the dimensional creatures in Magic Palace to injure you and this little girl,” Su Yi said with a smile.</p>
<p>After the filming at the entrance was completed, the group officially entered Magic Palace. Past the door was a large square.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures inside hadn’t been completely wiped out due to the drop in humans entering Magic Palace recently. There were many strange dimensional creatures wandering around the square.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen and company enter Magic Palace, the dimensional creatures immediately rushed over.</p>
<p>One of the Mythical humans didn’t spend much effort to finish off the dimensional creatures that rushed over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly observed Liu Yun the entire time. He didn’t pull off any tricks. He was akin to a professional videographer who was always loyal to his work.. He captured all the scenes the director needed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1439'>Chapter 1439: A Gift for Pandora</h3>
<p>It was rather normal inside Pandora’s Magic Palace. At the very least, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any problems.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures that appeared were things Zhou Wen had read about on the Internet. There was nothing abnormal about them.</p>
<p>The program team recorded and compared some places where humans often went. They wanted to prove that nothing abnormal had happened to Magic Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan followed them as they filmed. At noon, they finished filming about four places that people often went.</p>
<p>When the program team was having lunch, Liu Yun, who was disguised as a videographer, found an opportunity to come to Zhou Wen’s side. He said with a smile, “Mr. Zhou, the scenery over there is pretty good. Do you want me to take a picture for you?”</p>
<p>When he came close to Zhou Wen, he whispered, “Follow me.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen pulled Ya’er to the side.</p>
<p>After leaving the production team, Liu Yun gritted his teeth and said, “Why are you following me?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean why am I following you? Didn’t you ask me to take a picture?” Zhou Wen feigned surprise.</p>
<p>“Cut the act. Leave quickly. Don’t cause trouble here.” Liu Yun was a sharp person. He knew that Zhou Wen had definitely recognized him.</p>
<p>“Why should I leave? This isn’t your house,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was helpless against Zhou Wen. All he could do was restrain his temper and say, “I’ll tell you the truth. It’s now very dangerous in Pandora’s Magic Palace. Pandora’s box can open at any time. When that happens, the whole of Magic Palace will be breached. A terrifying Calamity creature will appear. If something goes wrong, there won’t even be a chance to escape.”</p>
<p>“Were you the one who spread the rumors?” Zhou Wen asked casually.</p>
<p>“It’s not a rumor. It’s the truth.” Liu Yun wore a sincere expression.</p>
<p>“I can see for myself if it’s a rumor. After observing the area for so long, why haven’t I discovered any signs of the magic box opening?” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Liu Yun tried his best to explain, “Pandora’s box is sealed. There will naturally be no warning signs when it isn’t opened. After it opens, it will be too late to leave. I spread the news ahead of time to give ordinary people a chance to escape. Otherwise, anyone in New De City would die. Ordinary people won’t have a chance of escaping.”</p>
<p>“Why are you here since it’s so dangerous?” Zhou Wen remained unmoved as he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to get rid of the scourge for the people. I plan on investigating the situation first. If the conditions allow it, I’ll think of a way to permanently seal the magic box before it opens.” Liu Yun looked like he was baring his heart. “Junior Brother, listen to me. Take the child and leave quickly. It’d be fine if you were alone. I can’t watch you take the child to such a dangerous place.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, you actually have such noble thoughts. You are virtually a hero who acts in the interest of the country and its citizens. It’s really impressive. Forget it. As your junior brother, I can’t hold you back. I’ll do as you say,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. Take Li Xuan with you and quickly return to Luoyang…” Liu Yun was immediately overjoyed when he saw how easy it was to convince Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No, what I mean is to do as you say. I’ll go with you and see if we can seal the magic box before it opens…” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s smile gradually froze. In the end, his face turned livid. He pointed at Zhou Wen and said fiercely, “Do you have to make things difficult for me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty.</p>
<p>Liu Yun pointed at Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. He wagged his finger a few times and looked like he was about to kill him when he suddenly retracted his hand. He forced a smile and said, “Junior Brother, we are all fellow disciples. Why make things difficult for one of your own? Go back now. I’ll treat you to a feast when I’m in Luoyang.”</p>
<p>“I want half,” Zhou Wen said directly, ignoring him.</p>
<p>“Half what?” Liu Yun said blankly.</p>
<p>“60%,” Zhou Wen said directly.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, I really…” Before Liu Yun could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen opened his mouth, prepared to raise the price again.</p>
<p>When Liu Yun saw the shape of Zhou Wen’s mouth, he knew that he was about to say 70. He hurriedly interrupted, “Half it is, but you have to work for it.”</p>
<p>“How do I work for it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Liu Yun looked at the production crew and saw that no one was paying attention to them. Therefore, he lowered his voice and said, “The opening of the magic box is true. I’m not lying. I spread the news because I really want to help them. I don’t want them to die without knowing why.”</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen look at him in disbelief, Liu Yun said helplessly, “Alright, I admit that part of the reason I sent them away was for this operation, but I also want to save their lives. This is an undeniable fact.”</p>
<p>“Get to the point,” Zhou Wen said impatiently.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the legend of Pandora?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that obvious? Has anyone not heard of it? Even a three-year-old knows the legend of the magic box,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Pandora’s box was something that happened later. Before Pandora’s box, the gods gave some gifts to her. Do you know what they were?” Liu Yun whispered.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen only knew of such a myth, but he didn’t know the exact details.</p>
<p>“Prometheus stole fire from the sun and gave it to humans, bringing light to humans. In order to punish humans, the gods used a Goddess as a blueprint to create a beautiful woman, Pandora. The Goddess of Love and Beauty gave her a mesmerizing perfume. Athena gave her a silvery gown, the Fire God gave her a sash, necklaces, rings, and other divine items. Hermes gave her the gift of language, making her the most perfect woman in the world…” As Liu Yun spoke, his drool was about to drip out.</p>
<p>Wiping the corner of his mouth, Liu Yun continued, “Think about it. Those divine clothes, ribbons, necklaces, rings, and so on are all true divine items. They aren’t the calamity in the magic box. According to my speculation, I’m certain that Pandora is at the Calamity grade. Then, the things on her must be good things at the Calamity grade. If I can get them all…”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. You want to kill a Calamity-grade creature?” Zhou Wen felt that there was something wrong with Liu Yun’s words.</p>
<p>“Not kill, steal,” Liu Yun corrected.</p>
<p>“The things on a Calamity creature are one with her. How can you steal them?” Zhou Wen found it unreliable.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. If it were an ordinary Calamity creature, it might be the case. However, it’s different for Pandora. She’s just a tool that was created. Those things were given to her by the gods. They aren’t things that she comes with. I should be able to steal them,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. He had a nagging feeling that things weren’t as simple as Liu Yun had said.</p>
<p>“If you want to steal something, do it yourself. Why did you sneak into the program team?” Zhou Wen stared at Liu Yun and asked.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1440'>Chapter 1440: The Door Opener</h3>
<p>“If you want to reach the shrine where Pandora lives, you have to be with the program team,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun in surprise. Liu Yun’s spatial teleportation skill wasn’t inferior to his. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the program team could do something Liu Yun couldn’t.</p>
<p>Liu Yun explained, “There’s a special defensive mechanism in Pandora’s shrine. Not anyone can enter. Even Calamity-grade powerhouses will find it difficult to enter. There’s only one way of entry. Find someone suitable to open the door to Pandora’s shrine.”</p>
<p>“Someone suitable?” Zhou Wen had a guess.</p>
<p>Liu Yun glanced in the direction of the program team before explaining under his breath, “Based on my research, entry to the shrine requires a woman with a special Life Providence to open the door. I searched for a long time before I finally found a woman with that special Life Providence. It’s the female host, Su Yi. Only she can open the door to the shrine. When the time comes, we can enter and steal what’s on Pandora.”</p>
<p>“Your words are too contradictory. Since you haven’t entered before, how do you know that Su Yi’s Life Providence can open the door? Even if Su Yi can open the door, how do you know that you can steal the items from Pandora?” Zhou Wen still felt that there were many loopholes in this matter.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking so many questions? Just tell me if you want a part in this or not. If not, I’ll do it myself. Just don’t be in my way to wealth,” Liu Yun said impatiently.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a partnership, it’s best we make things clear. It’s fine if you don’t wish to cooperate. After all, Li Xuan is rather interested in Su Yi. If he knows, he probably won’t let Su Yi take the risk, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You want to kick me to the curb when I’ve outlived my usefulness?” Liu Yun glared at Zhou Wen angrily.</p>
<p>“Explain clearly if you want cooperation,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Liu Yun pondered for a moment before saying with a bitter smile, “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you, but I’m afraid that you won’t believe me if I told you the truth. It will be even more troublesome when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“How do you know I won’t believe you if you don’t tell me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I obtained the information from Jing Daoxian,” Liu Yun said directly.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian?” Disbelief immediately rose in Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“See? I knew you wouldn’t believe me.” Zhou Wen’s expression was too obvious. Liu Yun shrugged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell silent. Jing Daoxian might have really been to Pandora’s palace and might really know about the situation there, but why was he telling Liu Yun this?</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian couldn’t do much in the past due to his injuries.</p>
<p>However, Jing Daoxian’s injuries should have healed by now. Furthermore, he had a Companion Beast like the Yin Yang Mirror. Why didn’t he take the treasure from Pandora but instead told Liu Yun?</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t believe you, but Jing Daoxian is just too difficult to figure out. Why would he give you that information?” Zhou Wen said to Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“I made a deal with him. As for what deal it is, I can’t tell you. What I can tell you is that this information is very trustworthy. If you believe me, cooperate with me. If you don’t believe me, don’t be in my way. After this matter is over, regardless of whether it succeeds or not, I’ll treat you to a feast.” Liu Yun seemed very confident that the information Jing Daoxian had given him was real.</p>
<p>Since Liu Yun had already said so, Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t ask further.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s give it a try. How do you plan on getting Su Yi there? Don’t tell me you plan on kidnapping her?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to take a look.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was a careful person. If he wasn’t completely confident, he wouldn’t show that much confidence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen did eye the stuff on Pandora.</p>
<p>However, he was different from Liu Yun. Liu Yun wanted the treasures on her, but Zhou Wen was interested in Pandora’s magic box.</p>
<p>When it came to Misfortune-type items, Pandora’s magic box was definitely ranked first. If the magic box was a dimensional creature, using it to create a Mythical Serum might be of great help to Wang Chan.</p>
<p>“There’s obviously no need. They were going to the shrine to begin with. However, no one has opened the shrine’s door in the past. Su Yi doesn’t know that she can open it either. When the time comes, we just need to create some chaos and nudge Su Yi in the right direction. Once the door opens, we will enter without causing any trouble for the program team,” Liu Yun explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it was feasible, but he felt that if only Su Yi could open the door, she probably wouldn’t be able to escape so easily.</p>
<p>The two of them discussed for a while before Liu Yun pretended to take a few photos of Zhou Wen and Ya’er before returning to the program team.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was still chatting with Su Yi and company. Li Xuan was talented. In just a short period of time, he had already become very familiar with the production team as though he was a staff member.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, the production team began filming again. Zhou Wen didn’t find the two dimensional creatures he wanted along the way, so he didn’t take action.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found an opportunity to inform Li Xuan about his partnership with Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“How can you do that?” Li Xuan immediately shouted.</p>
<p>“Stop shouting. Do you want everyone to hear you?” Zhou Wen tugged at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan saw that the production team was looking at him, he hurriedly smiled apologetically, indicating that he was fine. Then, he squatted down and whispered to Zhou Wen, “Old Zhou, that Liu Yun isn’t reliable. If only Su Yi could open the door, would Su Yi be able to escape after opening it?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also whispered, “Of course I know that it won’t be easy for Su Yi to escape, but think about it. The source is Jing Daoxian. Even if we stop Liu Yun today and don’t get Su Yi to open the door, what will happen in the future? What if Jing Daoxian wants to enter the shrine himself?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan was taken aback when he heard that. He said gloomily, “Then what should we do?”</p>
<p>“Instead of thinking of a solution when the matter isn’t under our control, why don’t we figure things out while we still have the situation under control? If something really happens to Su Yi, we can help her. It’s better than letting her open the door only when she’s threatened, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but isn’t it too risky?” Li Xuan was still hesitant.</p>
<p>“Then marry her and protect her 24/7. Furthermore, you have to be certain that you can defeat Jing Daoxian,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing?” Li Xuan felt that this wasn’t a viable solution. He didn’t have any ideas and could only ask for Zhou Wen’s opinion.</p>
<p>“There’s no other way. Let’s escort Su Yi in and figure out what’s going on inside. We’ll completely resolve this matter.” On the way, Zhou Wen had already attempted to enter Pandora’s Magic Palace dungeon, but strangely, the blood-colored avatar couldn’t enter Pandora’s final shrine.</p>
<p>It was likely as Liu Yun had said. One had to have a special Life Providence to be able to open Pandora’s Magic Palace.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1441'>Chapter 1441: Pandora Shrine</h3>
<p>Pandora’s Magic Palace was a large maze, but to people who were familiar with it, as long as they could clear the dimensional creatures in Magic Palace, it wouldn’t be difficult to traverse it.</p>
<p>The only place that humans stepped into in the entire Magic Palace was Pandora Shrine.</p>
<p>The glorious palace that resembled a miracle stood in a corner of Magic Palace. There were many carvings regarding divine miracles engraved on its walls.</p>
<p>Basically, they were scenes of gods carrying out miracles and receiving human worship.</p>
<p>On the murals, Zhou Wen discovered carvings suspected to be the Sun God, the Goddess of Love and Beauty, the God of Metalworking, the Goddess of Wisdom, and even Hades.</p>
<p>These murals were extremely beautiful. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but wonder. If the gods really exist, do they really look like this?</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, I’m your host, Su Yi. It’s 4:12 p.m., 2nd June. I’m now in front of Pandora Shrine. This is the legendary place where Pandora sleeps. Recently, there have been rumors that Pandora will open the magic box and cause New De City to suffer…” Su Yi stood in front of the shrine’s door and introduced the situation.</p>
<p>As a videographer, Liu Yun was the closest to Su Yi. When Zhou Wen saw that Su Yi was about to reach Pandora Shrine’s door, they exchanged looks and hurriedly approached.</p>
<p>They naturally couldn’t stand in front of the camera, but at that moment, a powerful beam of light suddenly exploded, causing everyone to lose their vision.</p>
<p>The bright light had zero effect on Zhou Wen. Li Xuan was already prepared. After his Terror transformation, light was useless for his eyes.</p>
<p>The two of them saw that Liu Yun had already rushed in front of Su Yi and pushed her towards the door of the shrine.</p>
<p>Su Yi’s strength was considered pretty good among ordinary people. She had reached the peak of the Epic stage, but against an expert like Liu Yun, she was nothing.</p>
<p>She didn’t even see Liu Yun as she involuntarily lunged towards the shrine’s door.</p>
<p>Liu Yun controlled his strength very well. When Su Yi pressed her hands against the door, she touched two unicorn symbols.</p>
<p>Her palm was pierced by the protruding horn, and blood immediately dyed the horn red.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The door emitted a dull rumble as it slowly opened.</p>
<p>Li Xuan rushed over to pull Su Yi away. Since the door had already been opened, she was useless to them now. Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian wouldn’t cause trouble for her again.</p>
<p>Liu Yun rushed towards Su Yi at the same time Li Xuan rushed over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to sense something as he flashed to Su Yi’s side with Ya’er. The three of them grabbed onto Su Yi’s body within a second of each other.</p>
<p>In the next second, a beam shot out from the opened door, instantly causing Su Yi, Zhou Wen, and company to vanish. The shrine door closed with a boom.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The four of them fell to the ground one after another. Li Xuan got up and grabbed Liu Yun by the collar and said angrily, “Scoundrel, how dare you lie to us?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun had only said that Su Yi could open the door, but he didn’t say that the door would close itself. Furthermore, it was obvious that they could only enter together with Su Yi.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t wanted to save Su Yi and arrived by her side in time, they would have been left behind by Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Calm down. I didn’t know that this would happen.” Liu Yun explained without any sincerity.</p>
<p>“What… What do you want?” Su Yi looked at them in panic. Blood was still flowing from her palm and her face was pale. She was clearly frightened.</p>
<p>“Su Yi, Old Zhou and I don’t have any ill intentions…” Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, they heard a boom.</p>
<p>The few of them jumped in fright and couldn’t help but look in the direction of the rumbling. They were alarmed by what they saw.</p>
<p>The place they landed in was actually a huge garden. The garden was circular, and in the middle was a small circular patio. The garden had paths that went horizontally, vertically, and diagonally that demarcated different flower beds.</p>
<p>However, the flowers in the flower beds looked terrifying.</p>
<p>There were sparse flower trees planted in the flower bed, but they didn’t have a single leaf. Their branches were twisted like venomous snakes in a withered gray color.</p>
<p>Each flower tree only had one flower. It was different from ordinary flowers. The flowers didn’t face the sky but towards the ground. Furthermore, the petals were closed.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the flowers looked like people hanging off the trees from afar.</p>
<p>The rumbling sound came from the top of the garden. It was the palace’s dome. It was a standard dome with layers of statues.</p>
<p>A gorgeous crystal chandelier hung down from the middle of the dome. There were many lamps of various sizes on the crystal chandelier like blobs of flowers and its diameter exceeded ten meters.</p>
<p>The flower-like lamps were all lit up. The sound should have come from the crystal chandelier, but they didn’t see anything that could make such a loud sound.</p>
<p>“Those crystal lamps seem a little odd!” Liu Yun looked up for a while and suddenly frowned.</p>
<p>“Don’t pull any of your tricks.” Li Xuan still refused to let go of Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“Old Li, let him go. Protect Su Yi.” Zhou Wen knew that with Liu Yun’s spatial teleportation ability, it was useless for Li Xuan to grab him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan glared at Liu Yun before letting go and retreating to Su Yi’s side.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi retreated and maintained a certain distance from Li Xuan. She no longer trusted anyone. No matter how she looked at it, Li Xuan, Zhou Wen, and Liu Yun were in cahoots.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was somewhat helpless. It was useless explaining anything now. All he could do was stand beside Su Yi without a word.</p>
<p>“Look at the crystal chandelier’s flames,” Liu Yun straightened his clothes and pointed.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with the flames?” Li Xuan asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel that the flames seem to be alive?” Liu Yun said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Alive?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen carefully looked at the flames.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s eyesight was average, so he didn’t discover any problems. However, Zhou Wen’s eyesight was extraordinary. After taking a closer look, he realized that there was indeed something wrong with the flames.</p>
<p>The flames came from a small crystal ball inside the lamps. There was nothing wrong with the small crystal ball at first glance. It was a transparent, colorless crystal ball the size of a fist.</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen carefully scanned it, he realized that it wasn’t a crystal ball, but a huddled crystal creature.</p>
<p>As their bodies were flawless, transparent crystals without any impurities or colors, it was almost impossible to tell when they curled up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still watching when he heard a boom. The huge crystal chandelier moved as though wooden blocks were being reorganized, causing the crystal chandelier’s shape to undergo a huge change. In the blink of an eye, it completely changed into another shape.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1442'>Chapter 1442: Su Yi’s Guess</h3>
<p>“9!” Li Xuan protected Su Yi as he muttered in puzzlement.</p>
<p>After the crystal chandelier transformed, it turned into the shape of a number 9, still hanging under the dome.</p>
<p>“It might also be 6,” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care if it was 9 or 6. He looked around and didn’t discover the door he had come from. He attempted to teleport out, but realized that the space in the temple was isolated. Unless he found the door that he had entered, it was impossible for him to leave.</p>
<p>However, there was only one garden in the palace. There was no path that led elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, where’s Pandora?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun scratched his head and said gloomily, “Jing Daoxian only said that Pandora is in the temple, but he didn’t say exactly where. I’m not too sure either.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Liu Yun’s gaze landed on the hanging flowers. “Do you think it’s possible that Pandora is inside those flowers? Those flowers aren’t small, and their shapes are human-like. It shouldn’t be a problem to hide a person inside, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard of Pandora being made of mud by the gods, but I’ve never heard of her being born from flowers,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s best not to touch those flowers.” Zhou Wen had already scanned the flowers with Truth Listener, but he couldn’t see the situation inside. Furthermore, the hanging flowers gave him a sense of danger.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring me in?” Su Yi couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Miss Su, Zhou Wen and I definitely don’t have any ill intentions towards you. As for whether he has any ill intentions towards you, we don’t know,” Li Xuan said as he glanced at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Am I the kind of person who will hurt women?” Liu Yun shouted unhappily.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhou Wen and Li Xuan answered simultaneously with great certainty.</p>
<p>Liu Yun said angrily, “You can’t blame me for this. After all, we are fellow disciples in the same school, right? Zhou Wen, the two of us were taught by the same teacher. I’m your eldest senior brother after all. Why are you always glaring at me? It’s only right for me to shake you off, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m used to it. There are benefits following you,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>Liu Yun nearly blew a gasket when he heard Zhou Wen’s answer. He said hatefully, “You were the one who insisted on coming. Don’t blame anyone if anything happens. As for Miss Su, I really don’t have any ill intentions towards you. Only you can open this door. Only you can enter. After we obtain the item, I’ll have to trouble you to take us out. Don’t worry. Even if I kill those two fellows, I won’t let you suffer any harm. Instead, it’s those two shameless fellows whom you have to be careful about. Don’t be foolishly exploited by them.”</p>
<p>“Miss Su, the two of us don’t have any ill intentions towards you. We were afraid that you would be harmed by him, so we followed you in,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by afraid of being harmed by me? If you really want to be a goody two shoes, shouldn’t you have stopped me outside…”</p>
<p>“Alright, cut it out. Let’s figure out the situation.” Zhou Wen interrupted their argument.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had carefully scanned the area in the garden. There was no door and no way out, only the flower bed and crystal chandelier.</p>
<p>“Do any of you know the origins of these flower trees and the crystal chandelier? Or are they related to myths?” Zhou Wen asked as he sized up the flower trees.</p>
<p>There were only a limited number of objects in the garden. Whether it was to find the way out or to find Pandora and the magic box, he had to start with them.</p>
<p>Liu Yun scratched his head and said, “Before I came, I did a lot of research on Pandora. The gods did reward her with many things, but nothing seemed related to flowers, nor were there any legends about a crystal chandelier.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan also said, “I only know that there’s another name for Pandora. It means the woman who offers a gift. I’m wondering if there’s any connection with flowers since part of her name in Chinese means flowers. Could it be that Pandora is actually one of those flowers and the magic box is inside a flower?”</p>
<p>“Cut it out. That’s transliterated! It has nothing to do with flowers,” Liu Yun said with a pout.</p>
<p>Just as the two of them were about to fight again, Su Yi suddenly said, “Do you know who Pandora’s daughter is?”</p>
<p>The few of them were taken aback as they looked at Su Yi.</p>
<p>Su Yi was indeed a little afraid in the beginning, but now, she didn’t seem to be that afraid. She was holding her phone and filming from every angle in the garden. At this moment, she didn’t forget her job. Her professionalism was perfect.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Seeing Su Yi look over, the few of them shook their heads.</p>
<p>They were here to find Pandora. Who cared who her daughter was? They had never cared.</p>
<p>Su Yi smiled and said, “According to what I know, Pandora’s daughter is named Pyrrha. She later married Deucalion.”</p>
<p>The few of them were at a loss. These names were unfamiliar—names that they had never heard of before. They didn’t know what Su Yi’s sudden mention of this had to do with their current situation.</p>
<p>Su Yi felt pleased seeing their blank expressions. She smiled and said, “You might not have heard of these two names, but you should have heard of Noah’s Ark, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of this before. It’s the person who survived the flood, right? However, Noah should be a legend of another pantheon, right? What has he got to do with Pandora?” Liu Yun said.</p>
<p>Su Yi said, “Myths of a Great Flood appear in many pantheons. Pyrrha and Deucalion are Noah in Pandora’s pantheon. After Pandora opened the magic box, humans suffered all sorts of disasters. The final flood nearly drowned the entire world. Only Pyrrha and Deucalion created the ark and avoided the disaster of the flood. In order to revive humanity, Pyrrha and Deucalion had to find the bones of Mother Earth. And in the end, they realized that the so-called bones of Mother Earth are actually a type of crystal.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Zhou Wen and company couldn’t help but cast their gazes at the crystal chandelier hanging above them.</p>
<p>The crystal chandelier was made of crystals. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had already discovered that the crystal chandelier was actually a living creature. Therefore, the crystal chandelier was likely the bones of Mother Earth which Su Yi had mentioned.</p>
<p>Su Yi continued, “After Deucalion threw out the Mother Earth bone, it transformed into a man, and the Mother Earth bone that Pyyrha threw out became a woman. These people became the ancestors of the ancient Greeks.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A loud boom sounded as Su Yi spoke. The crystal chandelier above their heads changed again, its form rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company clearly saw that it was in the shape of the number “8.” This way, they could confirm that the previous shape was 9, not 6.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression was somewhat odd. According to what he knew, anything related to a flood wasn’t simple.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1443'>Chapter 1443: The Object in the Flower</h3>
<p>“Could this thing be a countdown? If this thing reaches zero, what will happen?” Li Xuan said as he looked at the eight-shaped crystal chandelier.</p>
<p>“Are there any records of these numbers in the myths and legends of Deucalion?” Liu Yun asked Su Yi.</p>
<p>Su Yi was also at a loss as she shook her head and said, “I’ve never heard of that.”</p>
<p>She felt convinced that the crystal chandelier was the legendary bones of Mother Earth, but she had never heard of all these variations. She vaguely felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether the crystal chandelier is made of the bones of Mother Earth, we have to quickly figure out this place. The change in the crystal chandelier numbers gives me a bad feeling,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then let me give it a try. Perhaps that crystal chandelier is the key.” As Li Xuan spoke, he wanted to transform into his Terror form and rush towards the crystal chandelier.</p>
<p>“Now isn’t the time to risk your life.” Zhou Wen stopped Li Xuan and summoned a Golden Battle God.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen now had two Golden Battle Gods. He had given An Sheng five Golden Battle Gods that had dropped previously. These two had dropped recently. Furthermore, the types were the same as before. He hadn’t managed to collect all six different types of Golden Battle Gods.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, is there anything you’s like to say?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun before ordering the Golden Battle God to fire.</p>
<p>“I’m out of solutions at the moment. We can only give it a try,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further as he ordered the Golden Battle Gods to fire. The target wasn’t the crystal chandelier, but the flower on the flower tree.</p>
<p>Explosive bullets struck the hanging flower. There was only a dull thud, like the sound of leather being penetrated, but there were no explosions.</p>
<p>The bullets seemed to vanish upon entering the flower. If not for the bullet holes on the petals, Zhou Wen would have wondered if he had scored a hit.</p>
<p>Terror-grade Explosive Bullets had a destructive power capable of blowing up a building. After a few consecutive shots, they failed to blast apart the flower that was as tall as a person. It was truly shocking.</p>
<p>The few of them stared nervously at the flower. Li Xuan shielded Su Yi behind him as Zhou Wen picked up Ya’er and summoned the Death Harbinger Crow.</p>
<p>Although this fellow’s level was very low, it might be useful.</p>
<p>Caw! Caw!</p>
<p>Death Harbinger Crow landed on Zhou Wen’s head the moment it appeared and let out an ear-piercing caw.</p>
<p>“Why did you summon this out? It’s so noisy,” Liu Yun jumped in fright and said unhappily.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could explain, he heard a splattering sound from the flower. White smoke spewed out from the bullet holes as though water had boiled inside.</p>
<p>“Be careful of the gas. Don’t be poisoned,” Liu Yun said as he retreated. He even stuffed a few pills into his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also summoned a few antidote pill essences and gave them to Li Xuan and Su Yi. Although they were only Epic pill essences, they might be of some use.</p>
<p>However, the white smoke wasn’t poisonous. Zhou Wen confirmed it by summoning a Companion Beast to probe.</p>
<p>As the white gas spewed out, the flower gradually withered like a deflated balloon.</p>
<p>However, the flower wasn’t empty. After the petals collapsed, they stuck to something. Soon, all the petals stuck to the object tightly.</p>
<p>If it looked like a hanging corpse before, it looked like a mummy now. The thing inside the petal was a shriveled humanoid.</p>
<p>“There’s really someone inside the flower. Could it be Pandora?” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s really Pandora, there can only be one. There must be more than ten flowers in this garden. What a coincidence. A random shot and we hit Pandora?” Liu Yun clearly didn’t agree with Li Xuan’s guess.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Amidst their conversation, the flower’s stalk snapped. The object that was wrapped in petals like a mummy fell and landed in the garden.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the thing was really like a mummy. It twisted its body and tottered as it walked towards them.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The Golden Battle Gods fired again. No explosions ensued after the bullets penetrated the petals and shot into its body. It was still that dull sound of defeat.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle Gods’ bullets failed to stop it. The thing withstood the Explosive Bullets and staggered out of the flower bed, walking towards the Golden Battle Gods.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Liu Yun were secretly alarmed. They had seen the power of the Golden Battle God many times. Although it wasn’t top-notch at the Terror grade, the destructive power of the Explosive Bullets was definitely the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>That thing could withstand the Explosive Bullets as though nothing had happened. Its strength was at least at the top Terror grade.</p>
<p>The few of them subconsciously retreated because they didn’t know what kind of power that thing possessed. No one dared to take the risk.</p>
<p>Realizing that the Golden Battle Gods were basically useless, Zhou Wen decided to turn the Golden Battle God into a revolver and let it land in his hand.</p>
<p>Bang! Zhou Wen held the golden revolver and shot at it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s shot was augmented with his Essence Energy, so the bullet’s strength increased significantly. When it struck the thing, it immediately retreated a few steps.</p>
<p>But that was all. After the bullet lost its forward momentum, the mummy walked towards Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“Watch me.” Li Xuan saw that the thing was only walking forward without retaliating. He summoned an Ice Silkworm.</p>
<p>The Ice Silkworm produced two pairs of transparent wings and flapped them to fly above the thing. It opened its mouth and spat out a ball of icy gas that enveloped the thing.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to use the Ice Silkworm’s freezing power to freeze it. Even if he failed, he could slow it down.</p>
<p>However, the scene he imagined didn’t happen. The thing actually walked out of the ice fog. Although there was frost on the petals, it failed to be frozen.</p>
<p>Liu Yun also secretly released a few poison needles that silently pierced through the petals, but they still failed to affect its actions.</p>
<p>“What the hell is that? Could it really be an immortal body?” Liu Yun’s expression changed when he saw that the poison needles were useless. He retreated even faster.</p>
<p>The three of them used many methods to attack the thing, but they didn’t have much of an effect. It was as though it really had an immortal body.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, you are the strongest here. I’ll leave this thing to you. I’ll come up with something.” Liu Yun retreated quickly.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating. He stood there and sized up the thing in puzzlement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1444'>Chapter 1444: Way to Use the Death Harbinger Crow</h3>
<p>Harbinger crows only spelled sorrow, never anything good. They were diametrically opposite to magpies.</p>
<p>However, the Death Harbinger Crow’s ability was very useful. Zhou Wen had been thinking of a way to raise its level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t have an Evolvable attribute. Zhou Wen thought of many ways, but he couldn’t raise its level even by one. He probably had to rely on a Samsara Stone to advance it to a higher level in the future.</p>
<p>The drop rate of Samsara Stones was unfortunately just too low. Zhou Wen had only had one drop up to now, but he had already used it.</p>
<p>However, even if it hadn’t advanced, it still looked useful. Zhou Wen had summoned it to see if its abilities were useful.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this fellow was of some use when he heard its caw.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Death Harbinger Crow wasn’t cawing at the thing that was charging at him. It was clearly cawing in the direction of the other flower trees.</p>
<p>Strange, by calling it a Death Harbinger Crow, it’s clearly telling me that this thing shouldn’t be a threat. However, from the way it looks, it doesn’t look like it poses zero threat. Zhou Wen shot a few more times and riddled the petals around the thing with holes, but he still failed to stop it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was considering whether he should retreat just as the thing arrived in front of him. It suddenly plopped down and lunged over in front of him.</p>
<p>After it fell, the petals outside automatically fell off, revealing what was inside.</p>
<p>The fiery-red glow nearly blinded them. They widened their eyes. Inside was a gorgeous golden-red robe, and it was feminine.</p>
<p>“Could this be the robe that the gods gave to Pandora according to legends? There are legends that the robe was given to Pandora by the Goddess of Wisdom, and there are also legends that the Fire God gave it to her. From the looks of this robe, the possibility of it being the Fire God is higher…” Su Yi was indeed a news reporter. She immediately thought of what it was.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the robe automatically flew up and floated towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and caught it. The robe landed on his arm before transforming into thousands of fire threads that fused into his body. They formed a flaming golden tattoo on his body before gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are you alright?” Li Xuan hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. This thing seems to be a Companion Beast!” Zhou Wen sensed the information and nearly laughed out loud.</p>
<p>That thing was called the Fire God Golden Silk Robe. It was actually a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to ask what level it was, but when he glanced at Liu Yun and Su Yi, he swallowed the words he was about to say.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s mind raced as he immediately rushed towards one of the flower trees without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Now, anyone could tell that the flowers on the flower trees were likely treasures that the gods had given to Pandora. Whatever he grabbed was profit.</p>
<p>“Liu Yun, don’t do anything rash.” Li Xuan reacted and wanted to stop Liu Yun, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan’s movement technique wasn’t bad, it was much weaker than Liu Yun’s instant transmission.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had already arrived in front of a flower tree while Li Xuan shouted. As he reached out to grab the flower, he said, “The items have been found. It’s up to your own abilities. Finders keepers!”</p>
<p>Liu Yun was afraid that Zhou Wen would not distribute it fairly. He was alone, and Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were two people. Wouldn’t that mean that two-thirds of the goods would be taken? He might as well strike first to gain the upper hand and take as much as he could.</p>
<p>With his godly thieving skills, even Zhou Wen might not be able to out-snatch him.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, quickly stop him. This fellow is very fast. He’ll snatch everything!” Li Xuan said anxiously.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. Let’s wait and see.” Zhou Wen had no intention of stopping him.</p>
<p>This was because the flower that Liu Yun touched was one of the flowers that the Death Harbinger Crow cawed at.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to know if the Death Harbinger Crow’s cawing was accurate. However, Zhou Wen secretly condensed the power of Human Sovereign. If Liu Yun really encountered danger, he had to help him.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s face was filled with excitement as he reached into the flower to grab the treasure. However, just as his palm reached in, he suddenly let out a strange cry and retracted his palm.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s retracted hand had completely turned black. It was as though it was dyed with ink. Black gas was still emitting from it. No matter how Liu Yun shook it, the black gas couldn’t be shaken off.</p>
<p>The black gas over Liu Yun’s hand rapidly decreased, but it wasn’t eliminated. Instead, it seeped into Liu Yun’s body.</p>
<p>The black gas in Liu Yun’s hand vanished in moments, but his forehead darkened, as though it was enveloped by dark clouds.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, are you alright?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun’s forehead and found it familiar.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, this is a curse! That’s not right. Why did you get a Fire God Robe while I got a curse!” Liu Yun looked at his face in the mirror and immediately, his face turned livid as he screamed.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, everything is fated in life. Don’t force it. This item isn’t destined to be yours,” Zhou Wen said as he shot at another flower.</p>
<p>After the flower was hit, it spewed out white gas and quickly shriveled. However, it didn’t take human form this time. After it dried up, it turned into a ribbon.</p>
<p>The flower fell from the tree and automatically flew in front of Zhou Wen. The withered petals on it dropped as a headband floated towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed the headband. It automatically landed in his hand before transforming into threads of light that fused into Zhou Wen’s body, forming a new tattoo.</p>
<p>Another Calamity-grade Companion Beast. Don’t tell me this place is filled with Calamity-grade Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he sensed the information from the headband.</p>
<p>If they were all Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, he would really be rich.</p>
<p>I see. It cannot be taken by hand… I understand… Liu Yun’s nose bled from the curse. He summoned a dart and shot it at one of the flowers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally thought that since he had agreed to split it 50-50, he couldn’t let Eldest Senior Brother return empty-handed. He would let him take whatever he could.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was because of the previous curse or if Liu Yun’s luck wasn’t good. His dart actually hit a flower tree that the Death Harbinger Crow had called out to.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>The flower was penetrated by the dart. Indeed, just like Zhou Wen’s two attempts, the flower withered and automatically fell, flying towards Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Just as Liu Yun was about to grab the treasure, he saw a gray gas fly out and envelop his head. It was so fast that he couldn’t dodge in time.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s forehead was black to begin with, but now his entire face turned gray. He looked almost no different from a corpse that was about to be buried.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1445'>Chapter 1445: Gifts from the Gods</h3>
<p>“My head is spinning…” Liu Yun felt dizzy. His legs seemed to go limp and he couldn’t stand properly.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he heard a boom. The crystal chandelier above him turned into a 7.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks as their expressions turned solemn.</p>
<p>It was difficult to come up with a countermeasure in advance without knowing what the countdown meant.</p>
<p>I’ll deal with those flower trees first. Zhou Wen held the golden revolver and shot at the flowers that the Death Harbinger Crow didn’t caw at. A few bullets penetrated them.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was a little dizzy from the curse. His nose was still bleeding, so he couldn’t afford to snatch the items.</p>
<p>The flowers fell and transformed into different shapes that headed for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>One of them looked like a necklace, while another looked like a ring. He couldn’t tell what the other four were, but their shapes were rather strange.</p>
<p>The first petal to fall was a flower that Zhou Wen couldn’t identify. After the petal fell, there was a stream of water inside.</p>
<p>The water immediately drilled into Zhou Wen’s body upon contact and spread throughout his body. Zhou Wen felt as though all his cells had been cleansed by holy water as they emitted shocking vitality.</p>
<p>Does this enhance my physique? Zhou Wen immediately realized that this wasn’t a Companion Beast, but something that strengthened his physique. Even without looking at the game’s data, he could sense that his physique had greatly improved.</p>
<p>Following that, the necklace and ring flew out of the petal, turning into streams of light that left a tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Another two Calamity-grade Companion Beasts! Zhou Wen nearly cried out in happiness. These were Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, not run-of-the-mill items. Having obtained four Calamity-grade Companion Beasts at once, the number of Calamity-grade Companion Beasts on Earth combined probably wasn’t as many as his alone.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited, the remaining three flowers opened one by one. The items inside flew towards him.</p>
<p>The three items were a blob of white gas, a crystal slice, and a water droplet.</p>
<p>Could those things enhance Essence Energy, Speed, and Strength? Previously, the water had strengthened his physique. Now, there were three things he couldn’t identify. Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely to enhance the other three attributes.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the three items had already landed on him and fused into his body.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, after the three items fused into his body, his Essence Energy, Strength, and Speed didn’t increase, nor did he obtain any Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Instead, he felt some strange characteristics appear on his body. After the water droplet fused into his body, Zhou Wen immediately produced a strange fragrance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only found the fragrance nice. It was fragrant, but not overwhelming. It was thick and not cloying, but he didn’t know what use it had.</p>
<p>After the crystal slice entered his body, it immediately transformed into two strange energy streams that flowed to his eyes. Zhou Wen felt his eyes turn cool, but his vision didn’t improve.</p>
<p>The white gas was the strangest. After entering Zhou Wen’s body, it quickly fused into him and vanished without a trace. Zhou Wen didn’t sense any changes in his body.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t… Old Zhou… Amazing…” Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what the effects of the three items were, he heard Li Xuan shout.</p>
<p>“What’s amazing?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, why do you look so beautiful all of a sudden? Your eyes look like they can hook people… If you were a woman… I might have married you…” Li Xuan said as he swallowed.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you talking about!” Zhou Wen suddenly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>This was because Su Yi and the cursed Liu Yun were staring intently at him. Their eyes were like lechers who had seen a beauty, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>“No good!” Zhou Wen exclaimed. He immediately took out a mirror from the chaos space and looked at himself.</p>
<p>At a glance, Zhou Wen nearly failed to recognize himself in the mirror.</p>
<p>The first impression the person in the mirror gave him was that he was fair and beautiful. In particular, his eyes had an indescribable charm that made one take a second glance. Those with poor self-restraint would find it difficult to move their gaze away from him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood what the three items were for. The gifts the gods had given Pandora were for her to seduce Prometheus’s younger brother.</p>
<p>Therefore, other than the precious divine artifacts, the gifts given to her by the gods were also gifts like temptation, fragrance, wisdom, curiosity, and so on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already guessed that the drop of water was definitely the aphrodisiac perfume from the Goddess of Love and Beauty. The crystal slice likely gave his eyes some special charm.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t figure out what the white gas was, it definitely had some special effects.</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have been greedy! Zhou Wen regretted it. It was impossible to get those things out now.</p>
<p>On the other side, the way Su Yi and Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen made him shudder.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Li Xuan was rather special to begin with. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated was also rather special, so he wasn’t too affected. All he felt was that Zhou Wen had become better looking.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The crystal chandelier changed again, turning into a number 6.</p>
<p>“Liu Yun, do you know what this crystal chandelier is?” Zhou Wen never believed Liu Yun’s words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he would solely trust Jing Daoxian’s words, resulting in him spending so much effort and using so many means to enter the Pandora Temple without knowing anything.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was already a little confused due to the curse. Now, he was affected by Zhou Wen’s fragrance and charm. He stared intently at Zhou Wen and said in a daze, “I’m guessing that it’s the countdown to the opening of the magic box. If we can’t stop it before the countdown ends, the magic box might open. When that happens, everyone will die.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that there was no need to ask why. Therefore, he hurriedly asked, “Do you know how to stop the countdown?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Liu Yun shook his head and looked at Zhou Wen with an even more infatuated look. Then, he added, “Junior Brother, don’t worry. Even if I die, I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had goosebumps all over his body when he heard that. He had the urge to give him a headshot.</p>
<p>“Wen, it’s the same for me. Even if I have to sacrifice my life, I’ll protect you.” Su Yi also looked at Zhou Wen in a daze.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, when did you learn the art of seduction? Even men are mesmerized?” Li Xuan was dumbfounded as he realized the problem with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s all because of those things. Let’s not talk about this now. We have to quickly think of a way to stop the countdown.” Zhou Wen’s heart raced.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1446'>Chapter 1446: Pandora</h3>
<p>“Why don’t we try and see if we can blast this crystal chandelier apart?” Li Xuan suggested.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch the crystal chandelier for now. I’ll think of another way.” Zhou Wen’s intuition told him that the crystal chandelier was too dangerous. Unless it was absolutely necessary, he wasn’t willing to touch it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had removed all the flowers on the tree. He originally wondered if the crystal chandelier would stop the countdown if he took everything.</p>
<p>That was now apparently not the case. At the very least, him grabbing the benefits was useless.</p>
<p>In theory, the gifts given to Pandora by the gods actually include those curses, right? If I don’t make any distinction and remove all the flowers, will I stop the countdown of the crystal chandelier? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of curses thanks to Truth Listener. Even if he opened a cursed flower, there shouldn’t be much of a problem.</p>
<p>After weighing the pros and cons, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate and shot down a flower that the Death Harbinger Crow had cawed at.</p>
<p>The flower fell and flew towards Zhou Wen. Inside it was a red mist. After it came out, it immediately landed on Zhou Wen, preventing him from dodging.</p>
<p>As expected, it’s still a curse. Zhou Wen felt Truth Listener on his ear constantly heat up as it crazily converted large amounts of Essence Energy. It was obvious that the curse was very high-level.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener had resolved the curse, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He didn’t dare strike down the remaining flowers at once. If the flowers weren’t filled with curses but a few terrifying dimensional creatures, it would be troublesome.</p>
<p>Now that they couldn’t leave and there was a haunting countdown, any mistake could kill them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already used to it. After all, every time he entered an unknown dimensional zone, it was highly unlikely that it would be easy. It was more important to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>I can only hope that there aren’t any hell-grade Calamity creatures in Pandora’s shrine. Zhou Wen had considered it before entering.</p>
<p>The legendary Pandora wasn’t strong in combat. She was just a tool created by the gods, so there shouldn’t be any powerful dimensional creatures here.</p>
<p>The flowers were blasted apart by Zhou Wen one after another, producing all sorts of curses. No matter how fast he was or how fast he instant transmitted, as long as he was in the garden, he would definitely be hit. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t dodge when he saw that it was a curse. He allowed the curse to land on him before resolving it with Truth Listener’s powers.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Another flower dropped, but this time, the falling flower was different from the previous ones. After the petals contracted, it actually took on a human form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he hurriedly said to Li Xuan and company, “Be careful. The item this time is somewhat different.”</p>
<p>“I’ll protect you!” Liu Yun and Su Yi jumped out almost at the same time. They jumped in front of Zhou Wen from both sides, as though they wanted to risk their lives for him and fight to the last drop of blood.</p>
<p>“Protect my ass.” Zhou Wen chopped at them, knocking Su Yi and Liu Yun unconscious and throwing them into the chaos space.</p>
<p>Su Yi was bewitched because her cultivation level was too low, while Liu Yun was affected by the curses. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so easily bewitched.</p>
<p>After resolving the two problems, Zhou Wen sent Ya’er into the chaos space to prevent her from being injured.</p>
<p>He summoned Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate. The Death Harbinger Crow was still standing above Zhou Wen’s head as it cawed at the flower that had contracted into a human form, as though it wanted to scream out its trachea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen unsummoned it. He already knew that there was danger, so it was useless keeping it outside. It was irritating.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy floated beside Zhou Wen as Demonic Neonate ran to a corner of the garden without standing with him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan had already entered his Terror form. His body looked like it was made of data streams. He summoned Planet Devourer and summoned it in its glove form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare call Tai Sui out at such a time. If it imbued any negative effects on him, he would die a grievous death.</p>
<p>He activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation just in case.</p>
<p>The human-shaped flower walked over step by step. The petals on its body gradually withered and peeled off, gradually revealing a woman’s figure.</p>
<p>The woman was wearing a gorgeous Fire God Golden Silk Robe and had a headband that resembled silk made from clouds. The necklace on her neck and the ring on her hand shimmered. Her entire body emitted a soul-stealing charm.</p>
<p>There was a heart-wrenching fragrance lingering over her body. Before he could see her face clearly, he already felt that she was warm and intoxicating.</p>
<p>When the petals that covered her face fell, even Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be attracted to her. He couldn’t move his gaze away from her.</p>
<p>He really couldn’t believe that there was a woman in the world who was so beautiful. Zhou Wen hated that he didn’t have enough words to describe her beauty.</p>
<p>If he had to describe her, Zhou Wen felt that this woman’s beauty was enough to make a chain smoker quit smoking. As long as he could see her, he wouldn’t smoke again.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, when did you have a twin sister?” Li Xuan looked at the woman and then at Zhou Wen as his mouth gaped in surprise.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen looked like the woman, but that their scents and charms were very similar.</p>
<p>“F*ck, you’re the one who’s twins with her,” Zhou Wen cursed, but he was secretly surprised.</p>
<p>Unless something went terribly wrong, this woman was very likely the legendary Pandora. However, even if she was really Pandora, Zhou Wen had already taken the gift that the gods had given her. Why did she have another set?</p>
<p>Could it be that the gods are so generous to give two sets of gifts? I reckon the gods aren’t that generous. Could one of them be fake? Zhou Wen suspected.</p>
<p>He wanted to summon the four Calamity Companion Beasts he had and see if there was a problem, but with this attempt, Zhou Wen’s expression changed.</p>
<p>He couldn’t summon the Companion Beasts that he had clearly contracted.</p>
<p>Could it be that they are really fake? Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. The thought just came to him, but he didn’t really believe so. After all, he was unlikely to be able to contract fake ones. Furthermore, after the contract, the information the Companion Beasts gave him was undoubtedly at the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Even now, the feedback from the four Companion Beasts was still at the Calamity grade, but for some reason, he couldn’t summon them.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The crystal chandelier changed again, turning into a 5.</p>
<p>As for the woman suspected to be Pandora, the petals on her body had completely fallen off. Her eyes opened, and the moment Zhou Wen saw them, he felt as though the entire world had been smitten by her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen now seemed to understand why Epimetheus would fall out with his brother for her in the myths and legends.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1447'>Chapter 1447: Rubik’s Cube</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had the urge to sacrifice everything for the woman, even if it meant sacrificing his life.</p>
<p>Thankfully, his willpower was strong to begin with. He immediately sensed that something was amiss and focused his mind to sever his thoughts, preventing himself from succumbing to temptation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that Pandora’s allure came from her fragrance, eyes, and beauty. It was also a special skill.</p>
<p>Even with Zhou Wen’s willpower, he felt immense pressure. He had to focus to control his mind.</p>
<p>Thinking of Li Xuan still beside him, Zhou Wen thought to himself, Li Xuan is such a lecher. I hope he doesn’t get attracted to Pandora.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried as he turned to look at Li Xuan, but was greatly surprised. Li Xuan didn’t seem to be affected much despite being a lecher. Although he was also looking at Pandora, his eyes were still clear. He didn’t look like he had been mesmerized.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen asked, afraid that he had made a mistake. With Li Xuan’s personality, he couldn’t believe that he hadn’t pounced at Pandora.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t rushed over yet. What can happen to me?” Li Xuan said in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“You don’t find her beautiful?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and knew that he wasn’t affected by Pandora’s seduction. That only served to surprise him even more.</p>
<p>“She’s beautiful, but no matter how beautiful she is, she’s not as important as one’s life. I can’t just bed her now, right?” Li Xuan found Zhou Wen’s words odd. No matter how beautiful a dimensional creature was, it couldn’t be eaten or married. What was there to say?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Could it be that a virgin’s Essence Energy Art makes him invulnerable to such skills?</p>
<p>After confirming that Li Xuan wasn’t affected, Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease. Since they were going to fight, he had to strike first to gain the upper hand. He summoned his two golden guns and shot at Pandora.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s two golden guns fired Explosive Bullets and Frost Bullets. Their destructive power was considered pretty good at the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Pandora did not dodge. When the bullet hit her Fire God Golden Silk Robe, layers of flames immediately appeared. Before the bullets touched her, they melted into a liquid and vaporized.</p>
<p>The freezing power of the Frost Bullets was useless against the Fire God Robe.</p>
<p>What a powerful Fire God Robe. As expected of a Calamity-grade Companion Beast! Why can’t I summon mine? None of the bullets Zhou Wen shot out injured Pandora.</p>
<p>Li Xuan flashed behind Pandora and struck the back of her head with Devourer’s palm.</p>
<p>Pandora’s headband moved by itself and wrapped around Li Xuan’s arm like a snake. Then, it swam up and bound Li Xuan up tightly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the headband was automatically shrinking, trying to snap Li Xuan’s body.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after Li Xuan’s body underwent Terror transformation, he was almost immortal. Li Xuan’s damaged body automatically healed the moment the headband tightened.</p>
<p>Li Xuan, who should have been sliced into several pieces by the headband, remained intact when the headband passed through his body.</p>
<p>“Die!” Zhou Wen saw that the crystal lamp was counting down to four. He didn’t dare waste any more time as he pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at Pandora.</p>
<p>Pandora waved her sleeve, and the flaming cloud-like sleeve met the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>The powerful defense of the Fire God Cloak was ultimately sliced apart by the Immortal Culling Sword. After the blade touched the golden silk robe, it tore through the sleeve.</p>
<p>Pandora retreated like a ghost, preventing herself from being hit by the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Pandora smiled and Zhou Wen immediately felt the terrifying temptation greatly increase. However, it was still useless to Zhou Wen. It couldn’t shake his willpower.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t affected. The two of them attacked Pandora one after another.</p>
<p>Pandora was a Calamity-grade existence after all. Her movement speed was above the two of them. With the help of the Fire God Robe, headband, necklace, and ring, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan weren’t able to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Pandora danced in the air like a fairy as her beautiful leg flicked out from under her dress and kicked Li Xuan in the abdomen, sending him flying.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan slammed into the wall like a cannonball. His flesh and bones were severely deformed as he almost turned into a pancake.</p>
<p>However, when Li Xuan broke free from the wall, his body rapidly recovered. His body completely recovered by the time he landed on the ground. He charged at Pandora again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed his sword art to its limits and used instant transmission to constantly blink around to hold back Pandora.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had the upper hand. Pandora’s strongest strength wasn’t her combat strength, and her Calamity Zone wasn’t a combat-type domain, but the power of temptation.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t buy it. Pandora’s Calamity Zone was basically useless to the two of them; thus, she could only rely on her own strength and divine artifacts to fight them.</p>
<p>If not for the four divine artifacts protecting her, Zhou Wen would have long slain her.</p>
<p>The Fire God Robe focused on defense, while the hairband focused on offense. The necklace had the ability to produce a sun-like flash that blinded her opponents, but this ability didn’t have much effect on Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As for the ring, it seemed to have some kind of augmentation effect on Pandora. It wasn’t a weapon that attacked proactively.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen soon became familiar with Pandora’s various techniques. He struck out more ruthlessly with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The crystal chandelier’s countdown was already at 3. However, Zhou Wen was confident that Pandora wouldn’t be able to last until the countdown ended.</p>
<p>After being held back by Li Xuan, Pandora’s figure came to a momentary halt. The Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand had already stabbed at her chest in a bid to instantly execute her.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword had already pierced through the Fire God Robe and was about to pierce through Pandora’s body, but a metallic clang sounded. Something blocked the Immortal Culling Sword, preventing it from piercing through.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted his sword and instant transmitted, dodging Pandora’s counterattack. He saw something appear from the spot where the sword blade pierced.</p>
<p>It was a black square box that looked similar to a Rubik’s Cube. Furthermore, it was pure black. It was very similar to the huge Rubik’s Cubes that had appeared all over the world, but it was much smaller.</p>
<p>Could that be Pandora’s magic box? Zhou Wen stared at the box and thought.</p>
<p>Without any time to think, the countdown continued. Zhou Wen slashed at Pandora at an even faster speed with his sword art.</p>
<p>However, what happened next left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed.</p>
<p>The magic box seemed to have a life of its own as it floated around Pandora. No matter where Zhou Wen’s Immortal Culling Sword slashed, the magic box would instantly appear and block it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had several sure-kill Immortal Slaying moves, but they were all blocked by the Rubik’s Cube.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1448'>Chapter 1448: Don’t Crowd Around</h3>
<p>The Rubik’s Cube appeared and disappeared unpredictably. No matter what angle Zhou Wen attacked from, the Rubik’s Cube could appear in time to block the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Although the Immortal Culling Sword could leave some sword marks on the Rubik’s Cube, it seemed difficult to slice it open.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Time passed without them realizing it. The crystal chandelier’s countdown had already reached 2. There wasn’t much time left for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly used Time Bandit’s ability to delay the Immortal Culling Sword from stabbing at Pandora. The outcome was the same. The Rubik’s Cube still appeared accurately and blocked the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy and the Golden Battle God also attacked from afar, but their attacks were useless against the Calamity-grade Pandora in the Fire God Robe.</p>
<p>Now, the only threat to Pandora was the Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan!” Zhou Wen kept attacking Pandora as he suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was very familiar with Zhou Wen. When he saw Zhou Wen’s eyes, he knew what he was up to. He immediately gathered his strength and struck the back of Pandora’s head while she was restrained by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>As Pandora’s attention was completely focused on Zhou Wen, she no longer had the time to block Li Xuan’s palm.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wore the Planet Devourer glove on his palm. When he struck Pandora’s head, the Devourer Glove forcefully sucked away a lot of her flames, forming a breakthrough point.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s palm struck down, but it failed to hit Pandora’s head. The magic box strangely appeared and blocked Li Xuan’s palm.</p>
<p>“Perfectly timed!” Li Xuan was waiting for this moment. Strength erupted from his body as the suction force of the Planet Devourer glove increased. He grabbed the magic box and prevented it from budging.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took advantage of the moment when the magic box was grabbed by Li Xuan; he slashed down with Immortal Slaying, producing a rainbow-like beam. The sword beam instantly tore through the Fire God Gold Silk Robe on Pandora.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>The magic box erupted with terrifying power, hoping to escape Li Xuan’s palm. However, Li Xuan desperately held the magic box as the Planet Devourer sucked at it, trying to pull the magic box into the black hole.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s fingers snapped as the Planet Devourer glove was damaged. The magic box moved to block Zhou Wen’s sword again while stained with blood.</p>
<p>However, it was too slow this time.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>When the magic box moved over, the Immortal Culling Sword had already slashed into Pandora’s head. It slashed down from above like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted his sword and retreated. Li Xuan’s injured palm automatically healed.</p>
<p>On the other side, Pandora levitated in midair with the magic box floating in front of her. Both of them were motionless.</p>
<p>A moment later, a bloody gash appeared on Pandora’s forehead. Then, the blood trail quickly spread downwards. Pandora’s body suddenly split into two and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Pandora left nothing, unfortunately. There wasn’t even a dimensional crystal. The divine artifacts on her body quickly shattered after she died, leaving only fragments on the ground.</p>
<p>After Pandora died, the magic box seemed to lose its life. It fell from the sky and rolled to the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s finally done.” Li Xuan heaved a long sigh of relief. Just as he was about to pick up the magic box on the ground, he heard a boom.</p>
<p>The crystal chandelier changed again—1.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Pandora is already dead; why is the crystal chandelier still counting down?” Li Xuan was alarmed. Some countdowns would already activate certain mechanisms when the countdown reached 1.</p>
<p>Even if it did so at 0, there wasn’t much time left.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen realized that there were two flowers that hadn’t been shot down. He hurriedly summoned the two golden guns again and shot at the two flowers at the same time, striking them down.</p>
<p>After the two flowers fell to the ground, Zhou Wen didn’t wait for them to float over as he charged forward and shot at them.</p>
<p>When he arrived in front of the flowers, he reached both hands into them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were no dimensional creatures inside. It was still a curse. When it crept up Zhou Wen’s arm, it immediately triggered Truth Listener’s power and was directly converted into Essence Energy that nourished Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked up and nervously stared at the crystal chandelier to see if it would continue counting down.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. When it was about time for the crystal chandelier to change again, it moved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s faces darkened as their hearts nearly stopped.</p>
<p>Who knew what would happen after the countdown.</p>
<p>Just as the two of them were about to go all out, they saw the crystal lamp’s shape change from 1 to 2. It didn’t turn into 0 as they had imagined.</p>
<p>Their eyes nearly popped out. It was so thrilling as though they had been on a roller coaster.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what the hell? It nearly scared me to death!” Li Xuan cursed.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we have stopped the crystal chandelier’s countdown. If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to leave when the crystal chandelier returns to its original state.” Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Those two shots weren’t bad. When did you start training? Not bad,” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“Please call me a marksman.” Zhou Wen pretended to blow at the muzzle and spun the two golden guns a few times before holstering them. He lowered his head and picked up the Rubik’s Cube on the ground.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, be careful. That’s the legendary Pandora’s box. Opening it might bring a calamity to the world.” Li Xuan was immediately given a fright when he saw Zhou Wen casually grab the magic box.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It won’t be opened so easily. I struck it with the Immortal Culling Sword so many times without splitting it open. It’s even harder to open with just my hand.” Zhou Wen held the magic box and sized it up.</p>
<p>On careful look, the magic box really looked like a three-dimensional cube. Although its color was the same, every face was divided into nine parts. There were almost indiscernible gaps between each part.</p>
<p>“This magic box looks like a Rubik’s Cube no matter how I look at it. Zhou Wen twisted his hand and the magic box really moved. Just like a Rubik’s Cube, Zhou Wen spun it ninety degrees.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, don’t do anything rash!” Li Xuan jumped up in fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected that this thing could really be twisted. He had struck so many times without moving it at all, so he never expected it to be twistable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Rubik’s Cube and didn’t dare move. Cold sweat oozed out of his forehead.</p>
<p>If this thing was really like the legends, he would really be a sinner if all sorts of disasters, plagues, and diseases ravaged the world after it was opened.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Rubik’s Cube had only been twisted a little and showed no signs of opening. It still quietly rested in Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>“Thank god.” Zhou Wen wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and realized his body had broken out into a cold sweat. His clothes were drenched.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1449'>Chapter 1449: New Bamboo Blade</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen held the magic box and didn’t dare move as he waited for the crystal chandelier’s time to change.</p>
<p>The number on the crystal chandelier gradually changed and it soon returned to 9 before finally returning to its original state. Then, he saw the door to the shrine appear on one side of the garden.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went up to push the door, but he couldn’t budge it. Knowing that this thing could only be opened by Su Yi, he released Su Yi and Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Su Yi was still attracted by Zhou Wen’s fragrance and other powers. Liu Yun was much better. The curses inflicted on him had clearly weakened. He also had a certain resistance against Zhou Wen’s attractiveness. At the very least, he no longer had hearts in his eyes. However, he was clearly a little exhausted.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, how can we open the door?” Zhou Wen got the obedient Su Yi to give it a try, but she failed to push the door open.</p>
<p>“You have to get her to press both hands on the unicorn horn on the door and have it pierce through her skin. Only her blood can open the door,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got Su Yi to give it a try. Indeed, when she pressed her hands on the unicorn symbol’s horn at the same time, her palms were pierced by the horn and they stained it with blood. The door immediately opened a crack.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company hurriedly grabbed Su Yi and teleported out of the shrine.</p>
<p>After exiting the shrine, Zhou Wen directly took on his Terror form, preventing the program team who were searching outside from seeing him.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave the matters here to you. I’ll deal with the magic box first,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan before heading for the exit of the Magic Palace.</p>
<p>After instant transmitting out of the Magic Palace, Zhou Wen teleported to the Moon.</p>
<p>“Lady Supreme Yin, do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen brought the magic box to Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.</p>
<p>Lady Supreme Yin’s voice drifted out of the temple. “It looks like a spatial item.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted the origins of the magic box to her. After listening, she pondered for a moment before saying, “According to myths and legends, there are two possibilities for the magic box. One is that the magic box is a Calamity-grade creature, but it doesn’t look like one. The second possibility is that there’s a Calamity creature trapped in the magic box. Once the magic box is opened, the Calamity creature inside will escape and cause a huge disaster. The latter possibility is very likely in my opinion.”</p>
<p>“In that case, there’s a high chance that there’s a dimensional creature with the attribute of Misfortune inside. Is it possible to use the Calamity creature in the Rubik’s Cube to make a Mythical Serum and give it to Little Chan?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Unless you have the ability to suppress the unknown numbers of Calamity creatures inside, you can abandon that thought. From the vantage point of myths, the Calamity creatures in the magic box are probably not ordinary Calamity-grade creatures. Furthermore, it’s very unlikely that there’s more than one. Otherwise, it’s impossible for them to cause such a huge disaster.” Lady Supreme Yin paused before saying, “Besides, I’ve already said it before. It’s best to use Mythical creatures to create Mythical Serum. Otherwise, Wang Chan’s body might not be able to withstand it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He held the magic box and asked, “Any ideas on how we should deal with this thing?”</p>
<p>“What else can you do? If you don’t have the ability to destroy the things inside, seal it forever and never attempt to open it,” said Lady Supreme Yin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that it was best not to open the magic box. He sent it into the Chaos Bead and sealed it in a corner.</p>
<p>After leaving the Moon, he took Ya’er back to Luoyang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally had the time to look at the four newly obtained Calamity-grade Companion Beasts when he returned to his room.</p>
<p>Fire God Golden Silk Cloak: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)</p>
<p>War Headband: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)</p>
<p>Helios Necklace: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)</p>
<p>Hades Ring: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen saw the stats of the four Calamity-grade Companion Eggs, he immediately felt so depressed that he nearly blew a gasket. These four Companion Beasts were limited in their usage. Even if he obtained them, he wouldn’t be able to summon them without a special Life Providence.</p>
<p>What a pity! Zhou Wen carefully studied the stats of the four Calamity-grade Companion Eggs. They were indeed pretty good, but unfortunately, he couldn’t use them.</p>
<p>Wang Chan’s Life Providence has the attribute of Misfortune, but it doesn’t seem to be the Lady of Misfortune. I wonder if she can summon these four Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen thought that he could give it a try if he had the opportunity in the future.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on trying. Firstly, Wang Chan’s level was too low. It wasn’t a good thing for her to have these Calamity-grade Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Secondly, Zhou Wen had a very serious problem to resolve. After being augmented inside Pandora’s shrine, no matter where Zhou Wen went, anyone who saw him would be like a beast in heat. The look in their eyes left Zhou Wen shuddering.</p>
<p>Creatures at the Terror grade and above had a slight resistance to his powers.</p>
<p>I have to resolve this problem. Zhou Wen didn’t dare leave the house. He had to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Even Truth Listener and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were unable to resolve his problem.</p>
<p>After all, these powers were beneficial to Zhou Wen. They weren’t malicious powers like curses. Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder weren’t of much use.</p>
<p>Despite racking his brains, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of any way to completely eliminate the strange powers in him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, your Bamboo Blade has been reforged.” An Sheng brought a rectangular box to Zhou Wen’s yard.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the powers didn’t affect An Sheng at all. An Sheng had been delivering meals over the past few days, and he didn’t dare let anyone enter the yard.</p>
<p>“Leave it there.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>“It’s best you take a look. If there’s anything that’s unsuitable and needs modification, I can take it back and get them to modify it,” An Sheng said as he placed the box in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense and opened the box.</p>
<p>He took a look and didn’t pick it up. However, Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement, “Was the Bamboo Blade’s scabbard also reforged?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the blade and scabbard are one. A reforged blade will be somewhat incompatible with the previous scabbard, so we decided to reforge them together,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out for the Bamboo Blade and couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>The former Bamboo Blade was already heavy enough, but now, it was heavier than before. Zhou Wen found it very heavy.</p>
<p>This was despite his strength. It was obvious that the Bamboo Blade’s weight was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade’s size appeared to have enlarged. It was about four feet long together with the scabbard. Its entire body was gray, unlike the former Bamboo Blade which was closer to black. It looked very strange, but the quality was excellent.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1450'>Chapter 1450: Influence</h3>
<p>The blade was inserted into the scabbard without any gaps. It was like a piece of gray bamboo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the hilt and slowly pulled out the Bamboo Blade from its scabbard. He saw that the blade inside was the same as the scabbard. It was grayish-white in color and looked heavy.</p>
<p>However, a careful look indicated that the blade wasn’t as thick as it looked. The heaviness came from the material itself.</p>
<p>The blade was very thin, but one could only sense its sharpness when facing the blade. Just looking at the blade made one find it excessively heavy.</p>
<p>“Were other materials added to the Bamboo Blade?” Zhou Wen pulled out the Bamboo Blade and brandished it twice. He could clearly sense that the Bamboo Blade’s characteristics were somewhat different from before.</p>
<p>“As there are limited amounts of Essence Gold, we’ve been researching alloys recently. It happened to bear fruit, so we used it on Bamboo Blade,” An Sheng explained. “Be it hardness or toughness, this new alloy has experienced a qualitative leap compared to the former Bamboo Blade. Chick’s help and many technological methods were used during the forging. Only then could we heat the alloy to a state where it could be forged…”</p>
<p>“This shouldn’t be an ordinary alloy, right? Zhou Wen reached out and flicked the blade.” The blade trembled, but it didn’t make any sound. It was rather strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that if there was really such a brilliant alloy technology, the Sunset soldiers would have one in each hand or the technology would be used to create bullets. The dimensional zones near Luoyang would have long been wiped out, making the situation different.</p>
<p>“There isn’t much of the material used to make this alloy. There’s no way to scale up production for the time being. Using it on the Bamboo Blade can be considered an attempt. The outcome isn’t bad.” An Sheng was telling the truth. It was indeed an attempt.</p>
<p>During this period of time, they had also used many methods to fuse the Refined Essence Gold and Holy Metal together. They hadn’t completely relied on Chick’s phoenix flames.</p>
<p>Pure phoenix flames couldn’t completely melt the two.</p>
<p>“How much did you spend on the materials?” Zhou Wen sheathed the Bamboo Blade. Now that there was no suitable dimensional creature to test the saber, he could only test it in the future.</p>
<p>“They are all materials from our own research. They aren’t worth much, so you don’t have to think about it. However, there’s something you have to be careful about,” An Sheng changed the topic.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Although Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng was changing the topic, he was somewhat curious.</p>
<p>“There’s news from the Li family that Xiao isn’t dead. Furthermore, he has advanced to the Calamity grade. There’s a high chance that he will come to seek revenge on you and Overseer,” An Sheng said with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>“Even that explosion didn’t kill him?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that he might not have been able to survive the Guardian’s final explosion. It was indeed surprising that Xiao hadn’t been blasted to death.</p>
<p>“In short, be careful. Even Overseer said that Xiao is very terrifying. If you aren’t careful, he might grab onto your weakness.” An Sheng repeatedly exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful. He couldn’t afford to be careless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had fought Xiao before and knew that Xiao was indeed terrifying. An Tianzuo had actually managed to finish Xiao off without anyone noticing in such a dangerous place like the Holy Land. He had even pulled off such a beautiful ruse, leaving Zhou Wen very surprised.</p>
<p>In fact, even Zhou Wen couldn’t guarantee that he could do better than An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen still hadn’t figured out how An Tianzuo had done it.</p>
<p>Even if he had subdued Xiao, it was unimaginable to be able to control his Guardian and use it like it was his. Furthermore, he had to make the dimensional powerhouses in the Holy Land not notice any flaws.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Zhou Wen knew that even if he offered to pay for the Bamboo Blade, An Sheng probably wouldn’t accept it. Furthermore, it wasn’t easy to estimate the value of such precious materials.</p>
<p>He planned on returning the favor when Luoyang encountered a problem in the future.</p>
<p>What can I do to eliminate these strange powers? Zhou Wen was still fretting over what had happened.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep!</p>
<p>His phone suddenly rang. Zhou Wen picked up his phone and realized that it was a message from The Thearch.</p>
<p>“Have you considered the previous suggestion?” The Thearch’s message puzzled Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Previously, The Thearch wanted him to pull out the stone saber on Fire God Platform, but The Thearch had offered him help in clearing the Venusian dimensional zone back then.</p>
<p>However, he had already obtained the Companion Beast in the Venusian dimensional zone. Furthermore, the Venusian dimensional zone and half of Venus had already shattered. The Thearch’s message now was puzzling.</p>
<p>“The Thearch, how long has it been since you read the news? Don’t you know that the Venusian dimensional zone has been cleared?” Zhou Wen sent a message.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Not only do I know that Venus has been destroyed, but I also know that the Venusian Companion Beast is with you.” The Thearch quickly sent a message.</p>
<p>“You must be joking. I do want it, but unfortunately, I don’t have the standards,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Don’t think you can rest easy just because you have the Venusian Companion Beast. Don’t forget that Venus isn’t the only planet in the Solar System.” The Thearch had clearly determined that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>“That has nothing to do with me. Even if another Companion Beast from another planet appears, a powerhouse like Human Sovereign will naturally snatch it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Your abilities have increased significantly, but unfortunately, you’re still too short-sighted,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“Any advice then? Let me see further.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind and took the opportunity to get some information.</p>
<p>“Do you think you will be fine after snatching the Venusian Companion Beast? I suggest you take a look at the recent news in the Federation.” The Thearch quickly sent another message.</p>
<p>“What news?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>However, The Thearch didn’t reply. Zhou Wen had no choice but to go online to take a look. Soon, he knew what news The Thearch wanted him to read.</p>
<p>Although the matter of Human Sovereign obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast plastered the headlines of all the major media outlets, one could still see many news reports of large-scale break-outs in particular dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched and realized that ever since Venus had shattered, breakouts happened across dimensional zones at a large scale. Although there had been such cases in the past, it hadn’t happened so frequently.</p>
<p>In particular, the frequency at which Calamity creatures appeared increased significantly.</p>
<p>“Are the recent break-out creatures related to Venus?” Zhou Wen sent another message to The Thearch.</p>
<p>“What else could it be? The shattering of any planet in the Solar System will have a huge impact on Earth. If the Companion Beasts in the Sun appear, it won’t be as simple as an influence. If the Sun also shatters, it will be a question if Earth is still suitable for human survival.” The Thearch finally replied.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1451'>Chapter 1451: Metal Seed</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously considered this problem. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. After Venus shattered, many people were thinking about the possibility of Companion Beasts existing inside the other planets or even the sun, as well as worrying what would happen if they were released.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, if there was no sun, humans below the Mythical stage would probably find it difficult to survive on Earth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the sun exploded, the energy produced would have an immeasurable influence on Earth.</p>
<p>“So what if you obtain all the Companion Beasts after they appear?” The Thearch’s message came again.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what The Thearch was up to.</p>
<p>“Help me do a few things and I’ll teach you how to prevent such a situation from happening,” The Thearch said.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Zhou Wen wanted to know what The Thearch was up to.</p>
<p>“I’ve already told you the first matter. I want that stone saber. There are a few other things I need your help with. Of course, with your unyielding character, I’m afraid you won’t be willing to do it now. It’s fine. I can wait. When the planets shatter, you will naturally beg to cooperate with me.” The Thearch knew Zhou Wen’s character quite well, so she wasn’t anxious.</p>
<p>“I do wish to cooperate with you. Why don’t you tell me what you need?” Zhou Wen still wanted to ask.</p>
<p>The Thearch ignored him. There were no more messages from her.</p>
<p>Let’s take it one step at a time. Zhou Wen also knew that the possibility The Thearch mentioned existed, but he could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued studying how to eliminate the strange power on him. Otherwise, it would be too troublesome. Affected by this power, he had no way of concealing himself. It was impossible for him to use other identities.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s impossible to remove it. Is there any way to hide the power of this fragrance? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the mysterious phone vibrated.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Golden Wyrm’s Birth has completed? Zhou Wen picked up his phone and realized that it wasn’t the Golden Wyrm, but a fruit on the Dead Man Tree that had ripened.</p>
<p>The fruit was born after the metal flower was absorbed. It was the first time the Dead Man Tree had absorbed a creature that wasn’t human. Therefore, Zhou Wen had always been looking forward to seeing what kind of Companion Beast the metal flower would give birth to.</p>
<p>Seeing that the metal flower Companion Egg had finally ripened, Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its information.</p>
<p>Metal Seed: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Metal Evolution</p>
<p>Companion Form: Ring</p>
<p>A ring-type Companion Beast is rather rare, but what does this Metal Evolution mean? Zhou Wen studied the annotation and only knew that it was an ability for metal lifeforms to evolve. He didn’t know what it meant.</p>
<p>He hatched it and summoned Metal Seed. Then, a purple metal seed appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. The seed was only the size of a quail egg and was covered in blood-colored patterns. It looked beautiful and mysterious.</p>
<p>However, it appeared to be a dead object. It couldn’t move, nor did it have any offensive or defensive abilities. Zhou Wen studied it for a long time but failed to discover its use.</p>
<p>After making Metal Seed take its ring form, Zhou Wen put the purple metal ring on his left pinky, but he didn’t feel any special effects.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll only know what it’s used for when it advances to a higher level. Zhou Wen attempted to use Essence Crystals to accelerate the ripening of Metal Seed, but he realized that it was useless. Metal Seed didn’t absorb Essence Energy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was studying Metal Seed, Xiao was half-kneeling in front of Holy God in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, I’ve successfully advanced to the Calamity grade. Please permit me to head to Luoyang and eliminate An Tianzuo.” Xiao’s tone was calm, but the raging hatred in his heart was unconcealed.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo naturally has to be eliminated. However, before that, there’s something I need you to do. After doing this, it won’t be too late to eliminate him,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, what are your orders?” Xiao lowered his head.</p>
<p>Holy God glanced at him. “It was a testament of your talent to return from the Lake Frustration alive, but you ultimately failed to reach the Paramita.”</p>
<p>“I was reborn thanks to you, Lord Holy God. I’ll do whatever you say,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>He had ultimately failed to reach Paramita and needed Holy God to pull the dying him out of Lake Frustration.</p>
<p>However, Holy God said, “You lived because of your own abilities. If you couldn’t persist until you had a Mythical body, it would have been difficult for me to pull you back from Lake Frustration even with my supreme means.”</p>
<p>“That may be true, but if it wasn’t for you, Lord Holy God, I would have long sunk to the bottom of the lake. Furthermore, you extended me such great help. To be able to return to the Calamity grade in such a short period of time… No… I should say that I’ve now truly advanced to the Calamity grade…” Xiao had now advanced to the Calamity grade by himself without using any Guardians.</p>
<p>“You have just advanced to the Calamity grade, and with existences like Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo in Luoyang, you might not necessarily succeed. The place I want you to go this time isn’t only for you to complete a mission, but to also boost your strength and give you a chance to improve further. When the time comes, no one will be able to stop you in Luoyang,” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Lord, where are you sending me?” Xiao couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“I want you to go down to Lake Frustration again and reach Paramita,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“But my previous attempt has already proven that I can’t reach Paramita,” Xiao said in a dilemma.</p>
<p>“It was impossible back then, but it doesn’t mean it can’t be done now. You previously used the power of Lake Frustration to advance to a Mythical body. Your body already has the power of Lake Frustration. Its effects on you will be minimized. With your current Calamity-grade power, you will definitely be able to reach Paramita if nothing goes wrong.”</p>
<p>“What happens after I reach Paramita?” Xiao asked.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you before that I saw a person whose survivability was nil swim across Lake Frustration and reach Paramita? After you reach Paramita, find him. No matter what method you use, you have to bring him back.” When Holy God mentioned the person, his eyes looked somewhat strange.</p>
<p>Xiao was slightly surprised. “If that person can really swim to Paramita by himself, he must be an extremely terrifying existence. Can my strength bring him back?”</p>
<p>“Humans are only humans after all. No matter how strong they are, they can’t withstand the power of time. At his age, even if he’s still alive, he’s probably on the brink of death. He’s definitely not your match. Even if he’s dead, bring his corpse back,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“What kind of person is he?” Xiao couldn’t help but ask curiously.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1452'>Chapter 1452: Battle of the Strongest</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“You will naturally know when you see him. Dead or alive, you have to bring him back. After the matter is done, I’ll give you the right to temporarily hold the Trajectory Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact in the name of Holy God,” Holy God said.</p>
<p>“Can I really wield the Holy Artifact?” Xiao was pleasantly surprised. Each of the six Holy Temples had a Holy Artifact. Xiao was from the Trajectory Holy Temple. If he could be in possession of one, his strength would significantly increase. It wouldn’t be difficult to destroy Luoyang.</p>
<p>“The Holy Artifact can’t leave the Holy Temple for long, nor can it stay on Earth for long. You can be in possession of it for a day,” Holy God said.</p>
<p>“It’s enough,” Xiao said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Go,” Holy God said calmly.</p>
<p>Xiao jumped into Lake Frustration again. He still felt his body sink as though many invisible wraith hands were pulling at his body.</p>
<p>However, compared to the first time he entered Lake Frustration, the strength was much weaker. Xiao swam forward with all his might in a desperate attempt to prevent himself from sinking into the bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>The secular world was filled with frustrations.</p>
<p>Strength came from a lack of desire. No desire led to zero frustrations.</p>
<p>However, humans were humans after all. If they didn’t have any desires, what was the difference between living and being a walking corpse?</p>
<p>It was impossible for everyone to not have frustrations. If they had frustrations, it was impossible for them to swim across Lake Frustration alive, much less reach Paramita.</p>
<p>Paramita did not appear far away, but no matter how hard Xiao swam, it remained right in front of him—unreachable.</p>
<p>His body seemed to be entangled by threads in the lake, making it harder and harder for him to move. He slowly sank to the bottom of the lake. It was the ultimate resting place of all mortals.</p>
<p>Xiao felt his consciousness gradually blur. He had long known that even if he had advanced to the Mythical stage in Lake Frustration, reaching Paramita was still a perilous endeavor.</p>
<p>I can’t die yet! Xiao bit the tip of his tongue hard, hoping to use the pain to sober up.</p>
<p>It was useless. He felt numb despite tearing the tip of his tongue. Blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth, but he didn’t realize it.</p>
<p>It’s still not enough to cross the lake? Holy God watched from afar as Xiao gradually sank to the bottom of the lake. He couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>No matter how many powerful creatures there were, it was difficult for them to swim across Lake Frustration. Even dimensional powerhouses were no exception. However, that weak human had managed to swim across Lake Frustration in what was a situation of certain death. Holy God had seen it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Holy God had always attempted to use humans to reach Paramita. Xiao wasn’t the first person to attempt it, nor would he be the last.</p>
<p>What a pity. This person’s talent and will are the best among the Saints. Even Holy God couldn’t rescue Xiao at that depth. Therefore, Holy God felt a little regretful, but it was only a fleeting thought.</p>
<p>After all, he was only a human. He could slowly nurture one in the future. If one died, more Saints would take his place. He had plenty of time.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao was about to sink to the bottom of the lake and Holy God was about to turn around to leave, he suddenly saw Xiao struggling with all his might in the lake.</p>
<p>As he struggled, the invisible threads of frustration that bound his body gradually receded. Just as he was about to sink to the bottom, Xiao gradually floated up.</p>
<p>His consciousness is actually so pure? Could hatred really make a person so pure? Holy God looked at Xiao who was swimming towards Paramita again and was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>However, he really couldn’t think of any power that could make Xiao’s mind so pure other than that.</p>
<p>Xiao slowly recovered memories buried deep within.</p>
<p>On the grassland in the suburbs, two children were fighting.</p>
<p>“I’m the strongest.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m the strongest.”</p>
<p>As the two children were fighting, a tall and thin middle-aged man passed by and watched with interest.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, the middle-aged man lost interest. His figure suddenly flashed as he picked up the two children who were fighting each other by the collar.</p>
<p>“Who are you? What are you trying to do? Let go of me!” The two children kicked and struggled with all their might, but the lanky middle-aged man’s arms were especially long, and their short legs couldn’t reach him.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to determine who’s stronger? That won’t give you an answer. Let me tell you of a way to determine who’s stronger.” As the middle-aged man spoke, his figure flashed and quickly moved towards the distant forest.</p>
<p>On the tip of a mountain that resembled a sword’s edge, someone had placed a plank. It was like a see-saw, other than the fulcrum being the mountain peak.</p>
<p>On both sides of the plank stood a child. Their weight affected the log’s balance, causing it to undulate as though it would fall into a bottomless abyss at any moment.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man stood on an ancient tree’s branch that protruded from a cliff and said to the two children, “If you want a duel, you have to do it in such a place. As long as you strike your opponent down, the other one will naturally be the strongest without any dispute.”</p>
<p>Ordinary youths would probably have peed their pants in fear. They might even fall down due to their fright.</p>
<p>However, although the two children were young and uneasy, they didn’t show the fear of ordinary children. They slowly moved their bodies and tried their best to maintain the plank’s balance so that it wouldn’t fall due to the tilt.</p>
<p>To be able to act so calmly at their age piqued the middle-aged man’s interest.</p>
<p>“It’s actually very simple to kill the opponent. All you need to do is run to the middle faster than the other party. Once the plank is in nonequilibrium, the other party will naturally fall. I’ll send the surviving one back,” the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>The two children exchanged looks and charged towards the center almost at the same time.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” The middle-aged man found it more and more interesting.</p>
<p>The two children reached the center at almost the same time, but the mountain peak was just too sharp. The bottom was filled with slippery cliffs, making it inconducive for standing.</p>
<p>One of the children didn’t hesitate to reach out to push the other child down.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the other child didn’t push forward like him. Instead, he turned his body slightly and jumped up.</p>
<p>The child, who had reached out for the push, never expected such a move. He exerted too much strength and found himself falling forward. Without any counterweight to balance the other side, the plank immediately slid down.</p>
<p>The child plummeted with the plank.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1453'>Chapter 1453: One Life</h3>
<p>The child’s eyes widened in despair.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, a pair of hands reached over and grabbed his hands, pulling him back to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>The mountain peak was sharp, preventing the two children from standing alongside each other. However, they grabbed each other with both arms and lodged themselves on the mountain peak, temporarily saving themselves from the clutches of death.</p>
<p>“Why… Why did you save me?” The rescued child looked at the opposite boy’s chubby face in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“You are my opponent, but not my enemy.” As the boy spoke, he glanced in the middle-aged man’s direction and said, “He’s the enemy. If someone is to be killed, it’s him.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged man smiled when he heard that. “You’re right. In theory, I’m your enemy, but not only do you not have the ability to kill me, but your fate remains in my hands. If I want you dead, you will be dead. If I want you alive, you can remain alive. Only by killing the other can you have a chance to live.”</p>
<p>“You may be right, but I won’t do as you wish.” As the boy spoke, he suddenly pulled the other child with all his might, allowing him to lie over the mountaintop. He released his grip and turned to jump down the cliff.</p>
<p>“Even if I die, it’s done on my own terms. It’s not something others can control.” The boy spread out his arms and fell down the mountain.</p>
<p>The child at the top of the mountain was first taken aback, but without any hesitation, he leaped up without a word and jumped in the direction of the boy’s plummet.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was slightly surprised when he saw the two children throw themselves off the cliff.</p>
<p>Just as the two children were about to fall to the bottom of the valley, their bodies stopped the moment they reached the ground.</p>
<p>Their faces were almost touching the rocks on the ground, but they ultimately didn’t.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man released his grip and the two of them landed on the rocks.</p>
<p>“You may not want to be controlled by me, but I insist on controlling your fate. Our game has just begun.” The middle-aged man glanced at the child who had thrown himself off first and said, “Don’t think that you can easily survive with those tricks. I can give you a chance to live, but whether you can walk out of here alive depends on the two of you. If you can exit here alive, we still have a chance to continue this game in the future.”</p>
<p>With that said, the middle-aged man turned around and vanished into the forest, leaving the two children in the middle of the forest.</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? Why did you jump down?” the boy asked the child.</p>
<p>“From now on, I, Uncrying Li, share the same life as you, An Tianzuo,” the child said seriously.</p>
<p>“In that case, what’s yours is mine?” An Tianzuo said as he looked at Uncrying Li.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Uncrying Li nodded.</p>
<p>“Since it is all mine, can I change your name? I don’t like the name Uncrying. I’ve disliked it for a while,” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Uncrying Li was somewhat stunned.</p>
<p>“Uncrying gives me sad vibes. I don’t like it. Let’s do it this way. Instead of not crying, why not laugh. Just call yourself Laughing Li. In the future, when there’s no one else, I’ll call you Laughing Li,” An Tianzuo said with a smile.</p>
<p>Uncrying Li raised his eyebrows and said spitefully, “I don’t like your name either. I’ll call you Tianyou from now on.”</p>
<p>“Tianyou as in being protected by the heavens? That’s nice. I hope the heavens can really protect us,” An Tianzuo said as he got up from the rubble and looked at the distant forest.</p>
<p>Four days later, someone discovered the two dying children on a mountain trail. They were covered in injuries and were being gnawed by dogs. They were almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p>One of the children protected the other child tightly. His entire back was mangled from the bites. He didn’t budge even when he fainted.</p>
<p>“Live on. Only by living on will we have a chance to make the enemy pay the price.” The person who saved them heard one of the children sleep-talking through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I have to swim over! Xiao swam forward with all his might. He didn’t have any other thoughts. All he knew was that he had to swim over to the other side.</p>
<p>He gradually approached Paramita that seemed to be enveloped by fog and impossible to approach.</p>
<p>Holy God watched Xiao’s figure disappear into the fog of Paramita and muttered to himself, “He really crossed the lake. There’s finally hope of bringing him back.”</p>
<p>Xiao crawled ashore and knelt in a flowerbed like a sea—an endless sea of flowers—panting heavily.</p>
<p>The spots where his body touched the flowers rapidly recovered. His originally exhausted body instantly returned to its optimal state.</p>
<p>Xiao felt that his body was filled with vitality as though he had been reborn. He stopped panting and sized up the flowers with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Only then did he discover something strange. The flowers here had no stem or leaves. They grew on the ground and covered the entire land. They stretched as far as the eye could see, and there were only flowers.</p>
<p>Xiao walked above the sea of flowers and had a strange feeling. It was as though his nerves were connected to the flowers. When he stepped on the flowers, he could actually feel the pain of the flowers being stepped on.</p>
<p>This feeling was very strange. It felt like he was one with the world, one with nature.</p>
<p>Perhaps this strange power had taken effect. Xiao seemed to sense something and walked in a specific direction.</p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, he saw a shackled old man lying in the flowers.</p>
<p>The elder’s hair and beard were completely white. His body was restrained by shackles. From the material of the shackles, one could tell that they were made of Holy Metal.</p>
<p>The elder looked like he was about to die. His body that was covered by the foliage of the sea of flowers grew many flowers. He looked like he was about to become a part of the land.</p>
<p>This scene was extremely strange. Even the knowledgeable Xiao was alarmed.</p>
<p>A living person had flowers parasitizing him. What kind of terrifying experience was that?</p>
<p>“Who are you?” The elder didn’t say a word or make any sound—he couldn’t even open his eyes. However, Xiao sensed his words.</p>
<p>Just like Xiao could sense the emotions of the flowers, he could also sense the information transmitted by the elder’s brain through the flowers.</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m Laughing Li. You are indeed here.” Xiao squatted down and brushed away the hair and flowers on the elder’s face. After carefully identifying him, he was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>overjoyed.</p>
<p>“Laughing[1. Note that Laughing in Chinese is also Xiao, but with a different intonation.]”Laughing…” The elder reached out with great effort to touch Xiao’s cheek. Flowers had already grown on his arm, making it rather difficult for him to move.</p>
<p>Xiao hurriedly grabbed his hand and placed it on his face. He continued, “Sir, Tianyou got me to find you. Don’t worry, we will definitely save you.”</p>
<p>“Laughing… It’s really you…” The elder was immediately overjoyed when he heard Xiao say the word “Tianyou.” This was because there was only one person who would call An Tianzuo that. The elder struggled to get up, but most of his body seemed paralyzed. He couldn’t stand up.</p>
<p>Xiao wanted to help the elder up, but the elder said, “It’s too late. I’m already at the end of my rope. If it wasn’t for that thing, I would have long died. Laughing, there’s something you have to help me take to Tianzuo. No matter what, you have to personally hand it to him.”</p>
<p>[1] Note that Laughing in Chinese is also Xiao, but with a different intonation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1454'>Chapter 1454: Hair</h3>
<p>“Sir, calm down. Tianyou and I have already made plans. We will save you,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“It’s too late. As long as I leave Paramita, I will definitely die without the help of the Paramita Flowers,” Ouyang Ting said.</p>
<p>“Why!?” Xiao was alarmed.</p>
<p>“I should have died a long time ago. It was these Paramita Flowers that sustained me to this day, but at the same time, I endure indescribably inhuman pain at every moment. If I didn’t know that Little Lan and Tianzuo would definitely come for me, I wouldn’t have wanted to live any longer.” Ouyang Ting paused before continuing, “Don’t speak. Listen to me. Even if you take me back, the monsters in the Holy Temple won’t let me off. Only by handing me over to them will you have a chance to expose that matter. Anyway, I’m already a dead person. After I die, it doesn’t matter where this useless body lays. As long as you take the thing to Tianzuo, I can die in peace.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to take the thing out,” Xiao sighed softly.</p>
<p>“Therefore, only by giving me to Holy God will you have a chance to take the item out,” Ouyang Ting said.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Xiao asked.</p>
<p>In fact, Xiao was puzzled. The old sir had already been captured and imprisoned previously. What could he still have on him?</p>
<p>Not only could he not hide it on him, even if it was hidden in his flesh and blood, but it was also impossible to hide it from an existence like Holy God.</p>
<p>“Pull my hair,” Ouyang Ting said.</p>
<p>Xiao reached out to brush away his white hair, but he didn’t discover anything inside.</p>
<p>There was nothing that could be hidden. Even a flea or a flake of dandruff couldn’t be hidden. Perhaps it was because he was in Paramita, but other than the flowers, there wasn’t a speck of dust.</p>
<p>“Sir, there’s nothing,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Cut off the hair on my head,” Ouyang Ting continued.</p>
<p>“Is it here?” Xiao touched the white hair on Ouyang Ting’s head in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“It’s about there.” Ouyang Ting didn’t explain much.</p>
<p>Xiao used his finger as a blade and swept across the white hair. Ouyang Ting’s white hair was immediately sliced off by a finger beam.</p>
<p>“Eh!” Xiao realized that a strand of hair couldn’t be sliced off by his finger beam.</p>
<p>That strand of hair looked no different from the rest. Xiao couldn’t tell what was different. No matter how he looked at it, it was just an ordinary strand of hair. It had originally grown on Ouyang Ting’s head and definitely hadn’t been transplanted.</p>
<p>However, this strand of hair could actually withstand his finger beam. Clearly, it wasn’t ordinary.</p>
<p>Xiao suddenly understood why Holy God hadn’t discovered that there was something wrong with this strand of hair. It was because Holy God was too confident. He believed that he could see everything clearly, but he never expected Ouyang Ting’s strand of hair to be problematic.</p>
<p>“See that? Pull it out and store it well. Take it to Tianzuo,” Ouyang Ting said.</p>
<p>Xiao nodded and pulled out the white hair.</p>
<p>This strand of hair was extremely tenacious. When Xiao pulled it out, he pulled it up by the root. The hair follicle was pulled open and drops of red seeped out.</p>
<p>However, due to the effects of the flowers, the wound was quickly healed.</p>
<p>“Sir, is there anything else you need to tell Tianzuo?” Xiao asked again.</p>
<p>“Tell Tianzuo to take good care of his mother and Little Jing. I, Ouyang Ting, owe them too much in this life. If they don’t mind, I’ll be their children in my next life…” Ouyang Ting sighed.</p>
<p>“How is this repayment? This is a debt collection, right?” Xiao was speechless.</p>
<p>Ouyang Ting chuckled and said, “Regardless of whether it’s to repay a debt or to collect a debt, as long as we have this affinity, even if it’s a negative one, it’s better than being strangers.”</p>
<p>“Sir, don’t be so tragic. What about you? Just wait here. We’ll rescue you when we come up with a plan,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>Ouyang Ting shook his head. “I’ve said what needs to be said. A person who should be dead will only suffer endless pain if they continue living. Just help me take the thing to Tianzuo. Furthermore, without me as your cover, it’s impossible for you to take the strand of hair out.”</p>
<p>“Sir, do you have anything else to say about this strand of hair?” Xiao asked again.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. When that strand of hair reaches the right person, it will naturally show its use,” Ouyang Ting said.</p>
<p>“Alright, Sir, bear with it here. I’ll think of a way to save you soon.” Xiao put away the hair, placed Ouyang Ting down, and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>“No, without me, those monsters from the Holy Temple won’t let you off. You can’t escape their surveillance with the item on you,” Ouyang Ting said anxiously.</p>
<p>“I have my ways. Furthermore, things are ultimately worldly possessions. Even if we forgo this thing, we have to keep you alive,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“No, absolutely not. That thing concerns the fate of Earth’s future—the lives of billions of people. That thing must not fall into the hands of the Holy Temple no matter what. Only by taking me back can you obtain their trust and have a chance to take my hair out. You mustn’t take the risk,” Ouyang Ting said anxiously.</p>
<p>Xiao looked at Ouyang Ting and was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>“Child, outsiders think that you and Tianzuo are at odds. They even suspect that Tianzuo harmed you. However, only I know that you are his best friend. Even if the entire world is against Tianzuo, you won’t be. Accept my request on behalf of Tianzuo, I beg you to take me to the Holy Temple.” Ouyang Ting’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p>“We aren’t friends. We are opponents.” Xiao paused before saying, “If I take you to the Holy Temple, Tianyou will probably hate me forever.”</p>
<p>“Then are you willing to bear this grudge?” Ouyang Ting asked.</p>
<p>“Sir, you are already forgoing your life. Such resentment is nothing,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Then take me back,” Ouyang Ting said firmly.</p>
<p>Xiao bowed three times at Ouyang Ting before lifting him up from the flowers. “Sir, let’s go.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been studying the fragrance for days, hoping to mask it, but the invisible allure didn’t change much. All he could do was restrain it a little.</p>
<p>Now, I finally understand why it’s said that the most deceptive people are never enemies, but people who say that it’s for your own good, but do despicable things. Zhou Wen was very depressed.</p>
<p>If the strange powers on him were negative, he would have eliminated them long ago. However, these strange powers, of all things, were beneficial to him, so it was very difficult to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Just as he was pondering over his next step, Zhou Wen suddenly winced. He used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping’s teleportation method. The coordinates were the Companion Egg he had left with Tsukuyomi. He sensed that the Companion Egg had been injured.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1455'>Chapter 1455: That’s Not How You Use It</h3>
<p>As Zhou Wen used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, he wore the Prisoned Dragon armor and gripped the Immortal Culling Sword tightly.</p>
<p>With Tsukuyomi’s strength, an existence that could threaten her was definitely not an ordinary creature. Zhou Wen didn’t dare let his guard down lest it killed him.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen teleported over and saw the situation in front of him, his mouth gaped open in shock. Words failed him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what planet it was—it looked huge and its gravity was much stronger than Earth’s. It also had an atmosphere, but it was clearly different from Earth’s.</p>
<p>There were rocks everywhere here, and between the two mountains ahead, there was a rod made of some unknown material. Pierced through the rod was a huge alien beast.</p>
<p>Flames flared into the sky between the two mountains. It looked like they were roasting the alien beast.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had seen the alien beast before. Its body was like a cosmic stingray. Its flesh was transparent with blue veins circulating through its body.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had only seen it twice, the powerful Calamity aura from its body had left a deep impression on him. It was definitely not an ordinary Human Realm Calamity creature.</p>
<p>For it to be roasted and wafting out a vague meat fragrance clearly meant that it was dead.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi sat on a rock by the side with one hand supporting her chin. In her other hand, she held the Companion Egg that Zhou Wen had given her. The Companion Egg was already damaged. From the nail marks on it, it was obvious that Tsukuyomi had cracked it herself.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Barbecue. There are no barbecue condiments or alcohol here. You should have some, right?” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s not how you should use the Companion Egg…” Zhou Wen said as he took out the condiments and alcohol he had placed in the chaos space.</p>
<p>“I don’t like red wine. Is there any sake?” Tsukuyomi looked at the red wine Zhou Wen took out and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I thought women liked that.” Zhou Wen put away the red wine and took out a large bottle of sake. He also took out a tokkuri flask and cups.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain where the beast was barbecued, Hashihime cut off a piece of meat from the beast’s body and delivered it over on a tray.</p>
<p>The meat that was crystalline and transparent like a river shrimp was charred yellow with milky-white insides after being roasted by the fire. Although it wasn’t laced with seasonings, it was already emitting a fragrant combination of meat and oil.</p>
<p>The difference between the alien beast meat and shrimp meat was that it had a lot of fat. After the roasting, the fat melted and dripped into the firm flesh. Not only did it keep the meat juicy, but it also made the meat even more fragrant and tender.</p>
<p>Hashihime placed a wooden table between Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi. She knelt in front of the table and sliced the roasted meat. As it wasn’t ordinary meat, the temperature was extremely high. Hashihime opened the alcohol flask and poured some sake into it. Immediately, there was a sizzling sound, as well as the rising vapor and the fragrance of the melted fat.</p>
<p>When the temperature of the meat dropped to a certain level, Hashihime began to add seasonings.</p>
<p>After preparing the roasted meat, Hashihime placed the cups and poured Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi some sake before waiting by the side.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the alcohol.” Tsukuyomi pinched the jade-like sake cup and covered her face with her sleeve. She downed the alcohol and smiled at Zhou Wen before placing the sake cup on the table.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the meat.” Zhou Wen raised his sake cup and downed it in one mouthful.</p>
<p>The kneeling Hashihime picked up the sake flask and filled their cups.</p>
<p>“Try it and see if it’s delicious,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“Then I won’t stand on ceremony.” Zhou Wen was hungry. He took the chopsticks offered by Hashihime and picked up a piece of roasted meat and placed it in his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard that in ancient times, immortals cultivated to a point where they didn’t need to eat or drink.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it was just a gimmick that had no truth in it. The higher the evolution of a creature’s body, the stronger the explosive power it could produce. The more energy it needed, the more it had to eat.</p>
<p>Of course, it might not be food. Those immortals might have higher-level food, such as concentrated Essence Energy serums.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Wen wasn’t capable of inedia. Although he could fast for a long period of time, it required him to expend the energy he had accumulated. There were no benefits.</p>
<p>When the roasted meat entered his mouth, he bit into the meat and immediately felt the juices seep out. It mixed with the seasoning and filled Zhou Wen’s mouth with fragrance.</p>
<p>“Delicious!” Zhou Wen chewed a few times and found the meat fragrant, tender, and smooth. It was indescribably delicious.</p>
<p>“Have more. I can’t finish so much.” Tsukuyomi pinched the sake cup with her fingers and stopped after taking a sip.</p>
<p>“This meat is pretty good,” Zhou Wen praised as he ate.</p>
<p>In any case, the alien beast’s body was as huge as a mountain. He couldn’t eat all of it even if he let himself go. It wasn’t even a drop in the ocean, so there was no need to stand on ceremony.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi watched Zhou Wen eat from the side without touching her chopsticks. Occasionally, she would take a sip of sake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had eaten four or five slices of roasted meat when he felt that something was amiss. In his stomach, cold air seeped out and spread to his limbs as though he had swallowed ice in summer.</p>
<p>Why does this meat contain so much Essence Energy? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised to discover that it was Essence Energy that surged out. Furthermore, it was extremely pure Essence Energy.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t just pure. It was a kind of high-level Essence Energy. The Essence Energy had a strange characteristic that was of a much higher level than Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy.</p>
<p>When the Essence Energy fused into his body, it affected him significantly. He could clearly sense that his physique was improving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was increasingly alarmed. Typically, after a dimensional creature died, most of its Essence Energy would dissipate. Only a very small portion could be stored in a corpse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to ask Tsukuyomi, but it was too late. The roasted meat he had eaten erupted with large amounts of Essence Energy as it swept through his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only focus on circulating his Essence Energy Art to direct the Essence Energy. Otherwise, his body would probably be destroyed by the massive amounts of Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s body became crystalline. He was still constantly emitting Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi waved her sleeve and Hashihime immediately flew towards the alien beast. The hundred ghosts descended at the same time and pounced at the alien beast’s corpse.</p>
<p>Under the devouring of the hundred ghosts, the alien beast’s flesh rapidly decreased. As for the hundred ghosts, they emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi only looked at Zhou Wen with a smile as she drank. It was unknown what was on her mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that his various qualities had probably reached the limit of the Terror grade. There was no way of raising it any further.</p>
<p>However, the Essence Energy continued fusing into his body, making him feel that some quality of his was still becoming stronger.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1456'>Chapter 1456: Stone-Elemental Zone</h3>
<p>After Zhou Wen had completely digested the Essence Energy, he opened his eyes and realized that Tsukuyomi was still sitting opposite him, looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>“Is the flesh and blood of Calamity creatures so nutritious?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>He had killed Calamity-grade creatures before, but he didn’t realize that their flesh was so invigorating.</p>
<p>“That’s not always the case.” Tsukuyomi put down her sake cup and said, “Only a portion of Human Realm creatures can preserve most of their energy in their bodies after death. It’s always the case for Hell level creatures.”</p>
<p>“This fellow is at the Hell level?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he turned to look at the roasted alien beast, but he realized that there was no sign of the alien beast’s corpse. The flames below had vanished, leaving only two bare stone mountains.</p>
<p>“You’re done eating?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I don’t like meat, but the ghosts in my domain like it very much,” Tsukuyomi answered.</p>
<p>“I never expected a Companion Beast to be edible. Furthermore, it’s so delicious!” The image of the Great Might Vajra Bull surfaced in his mind. He wondered if he could turn it into steak.</p>
<p>As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Tsukuyomi said with a smile, “Typical Companion Beasts are pure energy bodies. They can be treated as Essence Energy Crystals, but if you want to eat them, they have to at least reach the Human Realm. They might not be edible even at the Human Realm.”</p>
<p>“I see!” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>“Are you full?” Tsukuyomi put down her sake cup and asked.</p>
<p>“I’m stuffed. Thank you.” Zhou Wen thanked Tsukuyomi for treating him to the meat. It was very likely Hell-level meat. Ordinary people didn’t have a chance to eat it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that there were differences between Hell-level meat. The few pieces he ate weren’t meat from the ordinary parts.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to thank me. Follow me if you’re done.” Tsukuyomi got up and led him to a mountain range.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“There’s a dimensional zone here that I can’t deal with myself. You will help me, right?” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What kind of dimensional zone is it? Let’s study it first. How far have you explored it?” Zhou Wen couldn’t reject it since he had just eaten the meat.</p>
<p>“I’ve already explored the situation inside. It’s just that it’s not easy to kill a particular dimensional creature. Your sword should be useful. You just need to help me with the sword,” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt relieved when he heard Tsukuyomi’s words. Since Tsukuyomi was so confident, there shouldn’t be any problems.</p>
<p>He followed Tsukuyomi deeper into the mountain range. There were rocks everywhere, and there were no signs of life.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, it made sense. Apart from Earth, Zhou Wen had never heard of any planet having ordinary lifeforms. Even if there were, they were basically dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi stopped in front of a cave and pointed inside. “This is the entrance to the dimensional zone. The dimensional creatures inside are all stone-elemental. You can deal with the ordinary dimensional creatures, but leave the final Calamity-grade creature to me. After I hold it down, you can kill it with that sword.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally nodded in agreement and followed Tsukuyomi into the cave. He didn’t discover any dimensional creatures at first. When the rocks in the cave came to life and transformed into stone beasts, Zhou Wen realized that the dimensional creatures here were purely stone-elemental.</p>
<p>These ordinary stone beasts were at least at the Mythical stage. Occasionally, he would encounter a Terror-grade stone beast.</p>
<p>It gave Zhou Wen the perfect opportunity to test the new Bamboo Blade. He drew his blade and started slashing. The Mythical stone beast’s defense was rather powerful, but Zhou Wen didn’t use much strength before the Bamboo Blade sliced through their bodies.</p>
<p>The blade of the Bamboo Blade was very thin, making it non-optimal to use against stone beasts with all sorts of defensive skills. However, the new Bamboo Blade’s performance left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>A jade-like stone beast pounced at him. It was like a Luck Beast. It remained visible after its Terror transformation, but its body was extremely hard. The defensive halos on its body made it obvious that it was a dimensional creature that was very good at defense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would be difficult for the new Bamboo Blade to kill such a creature.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen managed to behead the beast by slashing out the saber with all his might.</p>
<p>What alloy did Ah Sheng add to the Bamboo Blade? The strength of this Bamboo Blade is probably comparable to the Immortal Culling Sword! Zhou Wen looked at the blade and couldn’t help but be surprised that it wasn’t damaged at all.</p>
<p>“That blade isn’t bad,” Tsukuyomi said as she glanced at the blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Even an existence like Tsukuyomi acknowledged its quality, exceeding Zhou Wen’s expectations. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy to return the favor.</p>
<p>After slicing open the Terror-grade stone beast’s body, he discovered a stone egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the stone egg and looked at Tsukuyomi. Tsukuyomi said indifferently, “That thing is useless to me. Keep it if you want it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he put away the Companion Egg and continued following Tsukuyomi deeper into the cave.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhou Wen picked up quite a number of dimensional crystals and Companion Beasts, but only one Terror-grade Companion Egg dropped.</p>
<p>The stone-type dimensional creatures here had very high Strength and Constitution. There were many defensive and Strength-type skills, but they weren’t the types Zhou Wen needed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When they arrived at a huge underground space, the underground rocks trembled as a stone behemoth crawled out of the cracks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that it was a huge stone turtle. However, it wasn’t strictly one. Its head was covered in horns and there was a stone beard under its chin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a huge stone monument on its back.</p>
<p>This appearance made Zhou Wen recall the mythical son of the dragon, Ba Xia. The dragon had given birth to nine sons, and each one was different. Ba Xia had the image of a turtle carrying a stone monument—it looked rather similar to this huge fellow.</p>
<p>The stone monument on the stone beast’s back lit up while Zhou Wen was still observing it.</p>
<p>There were many symbols engraved on the stone monument that Zhou Wen couldn’t understand. The symbols emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly used the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to block the light, but Tsukuyomi remained motionless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen soon realized that the light emitted by the stone monument wasn’t lethal to them, but the rocks that were illuminated by the light grew strangely.</p>
<p>The originally huge underground space shrank due to the growth of the rocks. The stone tunnel they had entered was completely blocked by the burgeoning rocks.</p>
<p>This fellow’s strength is really special, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi had already activated her Hundred Ghost Zone, and her surroundings seemed to turn black. Only Tsukuyomi’s body emitted a holy light like the bright moon.</p>
<p>Ghouls appeared in the cave and charged at the stone beast.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1457'>Chapter 1457: I Won’t Make It</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Despite being besieged by all sorts of strange ghosts like Crow Tengu, Hashihime, and Umibōzu, the stone beast remained motionless like a mountain. When all sorts of forces struck it, it was like a water spray gun hitting a steel plate—no damage was dealt.</p>
<p>What powerful defense! Zhou Wen began to worry if the Immortal Culling Sword could kill the stone beast.</p>
<p>Since Tsukuyomi could kill a Hell-level alien beast, it meant that even if she hadn’t reached the Hell level, she was definitely a top powerhouse at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>In her domain, all the ghosts possessed Calamity-grade power.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t sufficient to injure the stone beast at all. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he could slice open such a defense with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword was very strong, but its true might could only be unleashed when matched with a sufficiently strong user.</p>
<p>All Zhou Wen could do now was to pull it out and use it in battle. There was no need to talk about unleashing its true might; it was already a problem for him to rouse its might. It was really difficult to say if he could kill a Calamity stone beast with such powerful defense.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask Tsukuyomi when he saw that the attacks of the hundred ghosts were ineffective against the stone beast.</p>
<p>The stone beast’s domain was showing its effects. The surrounding space became smaller and smaller. When the entire space was filled with rocks, their movements would be greatly restricted.</p>
<p>Even if the rocks didn’t crush them, tearing through the rocks would clearly slow them down. Instant transmission was not even an option.</p>
<p>There were rocks everywhere. In an instant, his body would be stuck in the rocks.</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t be said he would be stuck. To be precise, the rocks would be him, and he would be the rocks. The situation would only turn even more perilous.</p>
<p>“I just need to hold it down, not kill it, so its strong defense is useless,” Tsukuyomi said calmly.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask Tsukuyomi how she was planning on holding down the stone beast, he saw a ghost suddenly fly above it.</p>
<p>The stone beast had been fighting the ghosts the entire time and had killed many ghosts, but in Tsukuyomi’s domain, the ghosts were immortal. It killed the ghosts again and again, but the ghosts continued to revive. They kept pestering the stone beast, preventing it from attacking its true opponent, Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>The ghost that flew above the stone beast was a wrinkled granny ghost. She extended her withered hands that resembled bird claws and pulled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately noticed fine threads that resembled strands of hair appearing on the stone beast’s body. The threads were countless and quickly intertwined. Soon, they weaved into hair ropes that bound the stone beast.</p>
<p>The hair ropes formed a net again, trapping the stone beast. The stone beast tried to tear the net, but like a fish, the more it struggled, the tighter the net became. The hair rope bound its limbs, making it abnormally difficult to move.</p>
<p>The hundred ghosts split into four teams and each team grabbed one end of the hair net. No matter which direction the stone beast charged in, the ghosts would exert their strength to hold it back.</p>
<p>The stone beast charged left and right, but found it difficult to escape. The hair net was extremely tenacious and elastic, perfectly restraining a powerful creature like the stone turtle.</p>
<p>More importantly, after being caught by the net, the stone turtle could no longer use the power of the Stone Escape to teleport. It lost its most effective teleportation method.</p>
<p>“That’s the legendary Kokuri babā, right?” Zhou Wen had previously studied the Ghost Parade. He roughly guessed her identity from her abilities.</p>
<p>Kokuri babā was the wife of a monk. Due to her dishonorable actions, she became a demon and specially gathered the hair of the dead to braid.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The attack of the hundred ghosts is only to create time for Kokuri babā. Only with enough ghost hair forming a net can we trap the stone beast,” Tsukuyomi explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally understood what was happening as he thought to himself, The ghosts in Tsukuyomi’s domain have their own characteristics and abilities. Such a Calamity Zone is clearly more terrifying than the stone beast’s singular domain. I wonder what kind of domain power I can produce in the future.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen were to make a choice, he would definitely be biased towards Tsukuyomi’s domain. It had more variation and allowed him to use different methods to restrain different enemies.</p>
<p>However, a domain wasn’t something Zhou Wen could decide.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that the type of domain was related to his talent, bloodline, and Essence Energy Art. He also needed to see what dimensional zone he used to advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how to use the dimensional zones’ powers to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? Let’s see if your sword can kill it now,” Tsukuyomi warned when she saw Zhou Wen standing there in a daze.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen snap to his senses. Realizing that the stone beast had been restrained, its speed no longer fast among Calamity-grade creatures, it was impossible for it to dodge Zhou Wen’s attack thanks to the ghost hair net’s restraints.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword without any hesitation and slashed at the stone beast’s neck with Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword slashed at its neck, leaving a gash. Rubble splattered, causing the stone beast to roar in pain.</p>
<p>Although the injury wasn’t serious to the stone beast, killing it was only a matter of time since damage was possible. It was a matter of how many strikes were needed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gripped the Immortal Culling Sword tightly as his figure flashed erratically. He slashed at the stone beast’s neck again and again, causing the wound to widen.</p>
<p>The stone beast was a dimensional creature that focused on physical attacks after all. Unable to close the distance with Stone Escape, it could only be thrashed by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“This fellow’s defense is really terrifying. If this continues, I’ll probably need another thirty to forty strikes to sever its neck!” Zhou Wen had already slashed dozens of times, but he only managed to slice off a small chunk of the stone beast’s neck.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to slash again, he saw the stone beast suddenly roar at the sky. The stone monument on its back flew up by itself. Without the stone monument’s suppression, the stone beast’s Strength and Speed increased drastically. It shook its body crazily and sent the ghosts that were pulling the net flying.</p>
<p>He dragged the ghost hair net into the rocks. Some of the remaining ghosts continued clinging onto the ghost hair net, but were unable to stop it. They slammed into the rocky ground.</p>
<p>The stone beast vanished. Only the stone monument floated in the air and emitted a strange light. The surrounding rocks grew crazily.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” Zhou Wen was searching for the stone beast when Tsukuyomi suddenly instant transmitted to his side and pushed him away.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the stone beast tore out from the rocks below. The horn on its head slammed into Tsukuyomi, sending her flying.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s body slammed into a stone wall, causing a large chunk to collapse. The ghosts and domain also vanished.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi!” Zhou Wen instant transmitted into the rubble and swept away the surrounding rocks. He realized that Tsukuyomi was held down on the ground and was on her last breath. He reached out to pull her body and realized that her body was limp as though she had no bones. Her bones had probably been shattered by the stone beast’s strike.</p>
<p>“I… I won’t make it… Before I die… Can you satisfy my last wish…” Tsukuyomi forced her eyes open and said with great difficulty..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1458'>Chapter 1458: Last Wishes</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Don’t talk; I’ll help treat you,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to use the power of Human Sovereign to treat Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi reached out to grab Zhou Wen’s hand and coughed out blood. “It’s useless… Cough… I know my situation… Cough… A body of Calamity… Cough… It’s not something that can be treated with powers below the Calamity grade… Cough… Zhou Wen…”</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s fingers tightened their grip over Zhou Wen’s hand, but because her fingers were fractured, she couldn’t grip it tightly no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>“I’m here. Tell me.” Zhou Wen hurriedly held her hand with both hands and sent the power of Human Sovereign over.</p>
<p>“I… never knew what fear was in the past… but I’m afraid now… I’m really afraid…” Tsukuyomi’s face was pale and her breathing was weak. Her dim eyes were filled with fear. “You humans have this saying of reincarnation… That there’s a next life… Cough, cough… However, creatures like us have no family or friends. We have no connection to this world. Once we die, we will truly vanish into thin air. We won’t leave any traces in this world… Cough, cough… No one can prove that I existed in this world. It’s as if I never existed… I… I’m afraid… so, so afraid… I don’t know if I had ever existed… Cough, cough… Or should I say… My existence… was just a meaningless dream…”</p>
<p>“No, you exist.” Zhou Wen felt Tsukuyomi’s vitality weaken. It was useless even if he injected the power of Human Sovereign into her body. It was difficult to stop her vitality from weakening.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen… You humans won’t understand… I’m not afraid of death… But I’m really afraid… I’m so afraid that I’ll be completely forgotten by this world… Can you help me leave something in this world… Even if it’s the most trivial thing…” Tsukuyomi spoke between breaths. From her situation, she seemed to be losing herself, her eyes about to close at any moment for all eternity.</p>
<p>“Tell me, what should I do?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I should have been satisfied… to be able to die in the arms of the person I love… Cough… But I’m a little greedy… I want more… I want to leave something in your life… Am I too greedy?” It felt like Tsukuyomi would stop breathing several times.</p>
<p>“No, humans are greedy to begin with. Your greed means that you are already someone like me,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh when he saw that Tsukuyomi’s situation wasn’t looking good.</p>
<p>“I’m really happy to hear you say that… Cough… Only you are willing to treat me as a person… If possible… I want to die as a person like you… As your wife… Even if it’s only in name… Cough… Even if there aren’t any traces of my existence in this world… At the very least, I’m still Mrs. Zhou…” As Tsukuyomi spoke, she kept coughing out blood.</p>
<p>“This…” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Tsukuyomi to make such a request.</p>
<p>“Sorry… I’ve made things difficult for you… I’m ultimately an anomaly… How am I qualified to be your wife… I’m not worthy of being Mrs. Zhou… Sorry… I… shouldn’t… have… said… these…” Tsukuyomi’s voice gradually weakened as her vitality was on the brink of drying up.</p>
<p>“No… You can of course…” Zhou Wen felt upset. He felt that he shouldn’t let Tsukuyomi die like this as he hugged her tightly.</p>
<p>“Don’t just talk… Use the ways you humans do it… to tell me the answer… It’s also the final farewell…” Tsukuyomi closed her eyes and pursed her blood-stained lips slightly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt ambivalent. Seeing Tsukuyomi’s pale face which seemed to have blood receding from it, he couldn’t help but pity her. He lowered his head slightly and was about to plant it on her red lips.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen lowered his head, the stone beast that hadn’t rushed over for some reason suddenly roared and swept down from the sky like a huge meteor that could destroy a planet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to carry Tsukuyomi and instant transmit away to dodge the stone beast’s pounce.</p>
<p>“I… won’t… make it soon…” Tsukuyomi’s breathing quickened as though her throat was stuffed.</p>
<p>“No…” Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi and reached out to stroke her hair.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The stone beast roared again, but this time, it didn’t lunge over. The stone monument that had been emitting light in midair suddenly shimmered as beams shot into the rocks. Stone pillars protruded from the surrounding stone walls and ground as they constantly struck Zhou Wen from all directions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued his instant transmission, but the stone pillars were almost everywhere. The moment Zhou Wen phased into existence, a large number of stone pillars bombarded him, giving him no time to stop.</p>
<p>“I… I… I…” Tsukuyomi repeated the word a few times, but she failed to continue because Zhou Wen kept dodging the attacks of the stone beast and stone pillars.</p>
<p>She looked like she would stop breathing at any moment, but she didn’t expire.</p>
<p>“I…” Zhou Wen instant transmitted again. Tsukuyomi, who was about to speak, was interrupted again. Her face flushed red as she suddenly struggled out of Zhou Wen’s embrace. Her body floated in the air as her long hair danced. Her body emitted terrifying moonlight as she stared at the stone beast with eyes like a cold moon.</p>
<p>“Die!” Tsukuyomi gritted her teeth in extreme anger.</p>
<p>Accompanying her furious cry, the Calamity Zone was unleashed again. The surroundings turned black as she stood in midair like a bright moon. Countless ghosts appeared under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The stone pillars that rushed out were shattered by the ghosts. The ghosts pounced at the stone beast and surrounded it, biting and attacking it.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>More than a hundred ghosts struck the stone beast with all sorts of strange forces, shattering the rocks on its body.</p>
<p>Although the offensive strength of every ghost wasn’t enough to severely injure the stone beast, more than a hundred ghosts kept bombarding it. The dense forces of various colors struck the stone beast, riddling it with holes.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In just a few minutes, the stone beast’s body exploded, and the shattered rocks fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open as he looked at Tsukuyomi in a daze. The power of the ghosts was clearly much stronger than before.</p>
<p>More importantly, Zhou Wen really couldn’t associate the present Tsukuyomi with the dying Tsukuyomi from a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>“What… What’s going on…” Zhou Wen stared at Tsukuyomi and asked.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s angry emotions calmed down from shattering the stone beast. When she saw Zhou Wen’s questioning gaze, her body immediately turned limp. Like a weak and delicate princess, she held her forehead and fell into Zhou Wen’s arms.</p>
<p>“That was my last burst of strength… I really can’t make it now… Cough…” Tsukuyomi said as she leaned towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Then continue with that final burst.” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless as he dodged and instant transmitted to the stone monument.</p>
<p>The stone beast’s body exploded as the stone monument fell to the ground. However, the symbols on it were still emitting light, allowing the surrounding rocks to continue growing.</p>
<p>If he didn’t finish off the stone monument, the entire dimensional zone would soon be filled with rocks..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1459'>Chapter 1459: Source of Calamity</h3>
<p>Tsukuyomi twisted her waist and did a spin, preventing herself from falling. She was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>If the stone beast had broken through her restrictions a little later, she would have succeeded. All was for naught now. She couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at the stone monument, leaving a sword mark. However, the stone monument instantly healed as though it had never been injured.</p>
<p>“What’s engraved on the stone monument is its merits it has done for all eternity. No power can erase it. Not even the power of a mighty immortal can do so,” Tsukuyomi said as she walked over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just raised his sword to slash at the stone monument again. Upon hearing Tsukuyomi’s words, he had thoughts of unsummoning his sword when, to his surprise, a force was suddenly released from the Immortal Culling Sword. It tugged at his hand and drove him to slash at the stone monument.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword struck the stone monument, splitting it apart instead of just leaving a sword mark like before. What was even stranger was that after the Immortal Culling Sword slashed, the engraved words on the stone monument appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>The stone monument turned into a stone slab. There were no longer any signs of carving on it, as though the engravings had never existed.</p>
<p>The two halves of the stone monument fell onto the rocks and shattered, turning into rubble.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but be stunned as she looked at the rocks on the ground.</p>
<p>“What’s the origin of that sword?” Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but look at the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword automatically returned to its scabbard after the slash. Zhou Wen held it in surprise.</p>
<p>He had always treated the Immortal Culling Sword as a nuke that was in the form of a cold weapon. He didn’t expect the Immortal Culling Sword to have such special effects other than its powerful destructive power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this effect clearly needed triggering. The numerous strikes he had delivered hadn’t triggered such a strange effect.</p>
<p>Could it be that Tsukuyomi’s words triggered its power? In that case, the Immortal Culling Sword’s intelligence is probably much higher than I imagined, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The moment the stone monument collapsed, the growing rocks slowly shrank back. The underground space gradually returned to its original state as the passageway that allowed departure from the dimensional zone appeared again.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi walked to the shattered stone beast’s corpse and picked up a fist-sized crystalline jade. She walked to Zhou Wen’s side and handed it to him. “Unfortunately, there aren’t any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals. This is the part of its body that has undergone the Calamity grade. It’s usually known as the Source of Calamity. It contains immense energy and can enhance the special attributes of one’s body.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to take the Calamity jade and looked at it before throwing it to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“I was just joking. Are you still mad?” Tsukuyomi caught the Source of the Calamity and said.</p>
<p>“This item is your food, right? I can live without it, but you can’t,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Are you concerned about me?” Tsukuyomi’s eyes were filled with joy.</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to see you die.” Zhou Wen turned around and headed for the exit of the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi smiled and put away the Source of Calamity before following him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word along the way. After leaving the dimensional zone, Tsukuyomi said, “There are some beautiful planets nearby. Furthermore, there shouldn’t be any other creatures on them for the time being. Do you want to take a look?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I still have matters waiting for me on my return.” Zhou Wen rejected Tsukuyomi and was about to teleport back to Earth.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was somewhat disappointed, but there was nothing she could do. All she could do was watch Zhou Wen leave as she sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>“Don’t damage it for no reason. It’s the last one.” Zhou Wen turned his head and threw a Companion Egg with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping mark to Tsukuyomi before teleporting back to Earth.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi caught the Companion Egg and was taken aback. After a while, she revealed a smile and muttered to herself, “The ancient humans didn’t lie to me. There’s some use to reading after all.”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to Earth, he took out his phone to look at his stats.</p>
<p>Indeed, he realized that his four basic stats had reached 99 points. That wasn’t all. The spatial attribute in the special attribute column had also reached 99 points. This was the first time Zhou Wen’s special attribute had reached the maximum value of his current level.</p>
<p>I never expected the Origin of Calamity to have such benefits. I have to think of a way to obtain some in the future. Zhou Wen organized his Companion Beasts again.</p>
<p>Quite a number of Companion Eggs had dropped during his recent grinding of dungeons. He had already obtained four Mythical Golden Battle God Halberds and three Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly realized that Companion Eggs with the word “Golden Battle God” seemed to drop especially easily. The other Mythical and Terror-grade Companion Eggs didn’t drop that easily.</p>
<p>Just after obtaining a Terror-grade Stone Beast Companion Egg, Zhou Wen looked at its stats and saw that it was indeed a strength- and defense-type Companion Beast. It had an armor form, but he didn’t lack such Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The stone beast’s stats were inferior to Prisoned Dragon’s, so Prisoned Dragon remained a prime choice.</p>
<p>Sell them? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to give the batch of stone beast eggs to An Sheng. He could leave it to him.</p>
<p>For the new Bamboo Blade to have such an effect, the materials used were definitely not simple. The value of this batch of Stone Beast Companion Eggs was far from enough. And this defensive armor-type Companion Beast could save the lives of many soldiers.</p>
<p>What’s the use of this Metal Seed? Don’t tell me I should bury it in the ground? Zhou Wen played with the Metal Seed Companion Beast.</p>
<p>He had studied this thing for a long time, but he didn’t find any way to grow it.</p>
<p>Thinking of the might of the metal flower on Venus, Zhou Wen felt that it was a waste to not do anything to it. He had to think of a way to advance it.</p>
<p>After some thought, he felt that he might need to plant it and produce a metal flower. Therefore, Zhou Wen dug a hole in his yard and buried the Metal Seed to see if he could end up with a metal flower.</p>
<p>After planting the Metal Seed, Zhou Wen deliberately poured some water on it, but he didn’t discover any reaction.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t grow so quickly. I’ll wait a few days. Zhou Wen turned around and prepared to find An Sheng to give him the Stone Beast Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen walked out of the yard, the Metal Seed tore out of the ground and flew back to him, returning to its tattoo form.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work? Zhou Wen summoned the Metal Seed again and saw zero changes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He thought to himself, This thing is a Metal Seed. Do I have to plant it in metal?</p>
<p>Seeing that there wasn’t any metal around him, Zhou Wen touched the Bamboo Blade with Metal Seed. He was only giving it a try and didn’t expect it to be of any use.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, after the Metal Seed came into contact with the Bamboo Blade, it stuck to it firmly like a magnet..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1460'>Chapter 1460 Fusion</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly retracted his hand, hoping to separate Metal Seed from the Bamboo Blade. A precious weapon like the Bamboo Blade couldn’t be used as fertilizer.</p>
<p>However, it was too late. The Metal Seed seeped into the scabbard like water, preventing Zhou Wen from grabbing it.</p>
<p>No! Zhou Wen was beyond tears. If Bamboo Blade was really expended as fertilizer, he would be beyond anguish.</p>
<p>After Metal Seed fused with the Bamboo Blade, the originally grayish-white Bamboo Blade scabbard rapidly darkened. In the blink of an eye, Bamboo Blade turned black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to pull the Bamboo Blade out of its scabbard, but he realized that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>After the entire Bamboo Blade turned black, the color gradually lightened. Soon, it turned pure white.</p>
<p>What’s going on now? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the Bamboo Blade flicked out of his hand. The originally extremely hard Bamboo Blade scabbard that couldn’t bend at all was now twisting in the air like a noodle.</p>
<p>After gyrating for a while, the Bamboo Blade curved into a circle with its head and tail connected, turning into a bamboo ring.</p>
<p>The bamboo ring shrank until it became the size of a ring that floated in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his finger with an odd expression. The bamboo ring automatically wrapped around his pinky. It was the finger he wore Metal Seed when it was in the form of a</p>
<p>ring.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade has become fertilizer just like that? Zhou Wen attempted to unsummon the ring. Indeed, it was like the Metal Seed from before. It returned to his body and became a tattoo. The tattoo looked like a straight piece of bamboo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone to take a look and his mouth gaped open.</p>
<p>Metal Bamboo Blade: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Jinxes Master</p>
<p>Life Soul: Inauspicious Wheel of Destiny: Holy Saber</p>
<p>Terror Form: Ferocious Saber</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Metal Evolution, Blood Calamity, Jinxes Master, Fusion</p>
<p>Companion Form: Ring</p>
<p>This… Zhou Wen nearly blew a gasket. It would be fine if Bamboo Blade was really absorbed as fertilizer, but this thing had actually fused with Metal Seed and become a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that there was a Jinxes Master in this skill. It was fine if there was a Jinxes Master in the skill, but its Life Providence was also Jinxes Master. This meant double Jinxes Master. It was way worse than the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, it was fine if it had double Jinxes Master, but its Life Soul was Inauspicious. It looked ominous regardless. Furthermore, the Terror transformation power</p>
<p>– Ferocious Saber-didn’t make things any better.</p>
<p>There was also a Bloody Calamity skill? Apart from Holy Saber that looked a little acceptable, this saber was practically a suicide weapon. Anyone who got sick of living could just bring it along with them.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already verified that Jinxes Master didn’t seem to be of much use to him, he still felt a little unconfident when he saw such a ferocious saber.</p>
<p>However, Jinxes Master definitely couldn’t be removed through fusion. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was used to using Bamboo Blade. He couldn’t bear to destroy it.</p>
<p>Metal Seed made Bamboo Blade a Companion Beast. As for Metal Seed, it directly advanced to the Terror grade because of Bamboo Blade. This can be considered mutually beneficial, but these attributes… Zhou Wen was in a dilemma when he looked at the Metal Bamboo Blade’s stats.</p>
<p>However, what’s done was done. Zhou Wen could only silently put away the Bamboo Blade. It was best not to use such an ominous blade. Who can withstand the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and the Metal Bamboo Blade! Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to summon the two at the same time unless necessary. After putting away the Metal Bamboo Blade, Zhou Wen went to look for An Sheng. Unfortunately, An Sheng wasn’t in Overseer Manor. Zhou Wen asked a few elders in Overseer Manor and learned that An Sheng had gone out to do something. It was unknown when he would return.</p>
<p>Forget it. I’ll wait for Ah Sheng’s return. Zhou Wen wanted to give the Stone Beast Companion Egg to An Tianzuo, but just the thought of An Tianzuo made him uncomfortable. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to go to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his yard and took out his phone again, planning on finding a dungeon to stroll around.</p>
<p>This dungeon wasn’t a random choice. Zhou Wen’s four stats had reached their limits. He needed to break through to the Calamity grade to continue advancing, so advancing to the Calamity grade was an imminent problem. From the looks of it, the only way to advance to the Calamity grade was to rely on a dimensional zone. Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could find a way to advance to the Calamity grade in a dimensional zone. I’ve entered quite a number of dimensional zones, but I’ve never seen anything that can advance a Terror-grade to the Calamity grade. Now, I can only try my luck and see if I can find any clues. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to head to Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>The reason he chose Mount Laojun was that the Dao Sutra came from Mount Laojun. Perhaps the opportunity for the Dao Sutra to advance to the Calamity grade was there.</p>
<p>After launching the Mount Laojun instance dungeon, Zhou Wen felt somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he was afraid of death. Death in-game was nothing. It was mainly because he had attempted to enter Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak in the past, but the outcome was somewhat wanting. Even though he had advanced to the Terror grade, he still felt that Mount Laojun wasn’t a place where he could do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>If Mount Laojun is really the place where Taishang Laojun has secluded himself, I’m afraid even an Apocalypse-grade creature might not be able to gain the upper hand. Zhou Wen entered the dungeon and activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder before walking to Golden Peak.</p>
<p>With the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of the taboo pressure from the Golden Peak. He walked all the way up the stairs and saw jade buildings everywhere. Beautiful clouds surrounded him as immortal cranes danced in the clouds. It was like a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare have any thoughts about the immortal cranes. He had come here when he was at the Mythical stage, hoping to kill one for fun. The outcome was extremely tragic. Ever since then, Zhou Wen no longer had any intention of killing the immortal cranes.</p>
<p>Clouds swirled above Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak as Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk between the pavilions. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder emitted a mysterious glow as it converted the taboo power into Essence Energy and injected it into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Just from the amount of Essence Energy received, he knew how terrifying the taboo in Golden Peak was. If not for the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen would have long died.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, mastering the Dao Sutra is a necessary condition to enter Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak. However, I wonder if Taishang Laojun is really on Mount Laojun, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar came to a stone pavilion. Along the way, other than the immortal cranes, there were no other dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>However, there was a dimensional creature in front of the stone pavilion.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1461'>Chapter 1461 Azure Bull</h3>
<p>Azure Bull! Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw the dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Sleeping soundly in the stone pavilion was an Azure Bull. Although he didn’t know its level, an Azure Bull that appeared on Mount Laojun was undoubtedly terrifying.</p>
<p>Legend had it that the Azure Bull was Taishang Laojun’s mount. Back when he rode the bull out of seclusion, he engraved his name in the history books.</p>
<p>Although it was only a mount, it depended on whose mount it was. Taishang Laojun was the founder of the universe, the ancestor of chaos, the parent of the world, the ruler of Yin and Yang, and the imperial lord of the myriad gods. His mount was much more terrifying than ordinary immortals.</p>
<p>Even the weakest possibility placed it as a Calamity creature, and definitely not a low-level Calamity creature at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>If it were in reality, Zhou Wen would immediately turn around and run as fast as he could. However, in-game, he didn’t have any qualms.</p>
<p>Let me see if this is Taishang Laojun’s Azure Bull. Zhou Wen summoned the three Golden Battle Gods and retreated a little. He activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and held the Bamboo Blade, prepared for the ensuing battle.</p>
<p>The three Golden Battle Gods used their golden pistols and aimed at the sleeping Azure Bull as they fired together.</p>
<p>The three bullets of different attributes hit the Azure Bull only to ricochet. The characteristics of freezing, exploding, and lightning were completely useless.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle Gods kept firing, but the bullets were like flies. They were useless. They couldn’t even wake the Azure Bull.</p>
<p>That’s way too powerful! Zhou Wen was even more alarmed.</p>
<p>The Golden Battle Gods were Terror-grade existences after all, but they failed to do a thing to the Azure Bull.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’m no match for the Azure Bull. I should head elsewhere to take a look. Zhou Wen decided to ignore the Azure Bull. Even if it wasn’t Taishang Laojun’s mount, Zhou Wen wasn’t its match with such terrifying strength.</p>
<p>He controlled the blood-colored avatar and turned to walk towards the stone steps on the other side.</p>
<p>However, just as the blood-colored avatar turned around, Zhou Wen heard a snap. A whip-like azure shadow flashed before the blood-colored avatar was diced to pieces. The game screen dimmed.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, that Azure Bull is sinister! Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the Azure Bull had definitely woken up, but it continued feigning sleep. It only attacked when Zhou Wen lowered his guard and turned to leave.</p>
<p>Although it was a sneak attack, to be able to penetrate the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation with one strike, such strength was definitely not ordinary at the Calamity grade. No matter how strong you are, you definitely have a weakness. I don’t believe I can’t kill you. Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and entered Mount Laojun again. Zhou Wen rushed to the stone pavilion where the Azure Bull was and summoned his Companion Beasts. He also attacked by summoning the Bamboo Blade and slashing out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally saw the Azure Bull look up. It looked like an ordinary bull with a huge steel hoop attached to its nose.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>With an azure flash, the Companion Beasts and the blood-colored avatar were torn apart. Zhou Wen finally saw the weapon the Azure Bull used for its attack—its tail.</p>
<p>This fellow is a little too powerful. Could it be that I can’t even withstand a single strike? Zhou Wen refused to believe it as he entered the dungeon again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen died again and again. It had been a long time since he had suffered such deaths. He resigned himself after the Azure Bull’s repeated kills. He had lost count of his attempts. At best, he could only dodge one tail strike. The second tail strike meant certain death.</p>
<p>If he used instant transmission, the bull’s tail would whip him to death when he phased into existence. Even the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation couldn’t defend against it.</p>
<p>The bull’s tail could extend and retract freely. It was like a divine whip.</p>
<p>If this is really that Azure Bull, then the bull ring on its nose might be Taishang Laojun’s Vajra Bracelet. That thing is an invincible treasure. If I can obtain it, I’ll really be able to live in the lap of luxury in the future. But how can I kill the Azure Bull? Zhou Wen tried again and again. Although he had The Disqualified that allowed him to spy on the Azure Bull’s weakness, the Azure Bull was too fast. Even though Zhou Wen saw an opportunity, he still couldn’t dodge the bull’s tail. Zhou Wen could only patiently carry out all sorts of tests in exchange for more understanding of the Azure Bull through death.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to circle around the Azure Bull, but the fellow seemed to be guarding the path that led behind it. Zhou Wen couldn’t circle around it no matter what. As long as he stepped onto that path, he would be killed by the Azure Bull even if he used instant transmission.</p>
<p>What’s behind Mount Laojun? The more he couldn’t cross the obstacle, the more Zhou Wen wanted to know what lay ahead. This required him to deal with the Azure Bull.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stayed at home the next few days and hardly left his room. Before he figured out how to kill the Azure Bull, the Soul Mirror had completed its evolution.</p>
<p>Soul Mirror: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: God of Unkilling</p>
<p>Life Soul: Mirror Immortal</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Soul Mirror</p>
<p>Terror Form: Mirror Deflection (S-grade) Calamity Zone: Mirror World (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 100</p>
<p>Speed: 100</p>
<p>Constitution: 100</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 100</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Soul-Washing Divine Light, Soul-Suppression Divine Light, Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, Soul-Illuminating Divine Light.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mirror</p>
<p>The stats and abilities of this Companion Beast are rather interesting. Zhou Wen carefully studied the various skills of the Soul Mirror and realized that it was indeed interesting.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Soul Mirror itself couldn’t kill any creature. The existence of the God of Unkilling Life Providence had already severed the possibility of it being a lethal weapon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Soul Mirror itself didn’t have the ability to kill.</p>
<p>The four types of divine light didn’t possess any physical lethality, but their effects on the soul were very obvious.</p>
<p>The Soul-Washing Divine Light could wash away memories. The Soul-Suppression Divine Light could suppress the soul, preventing the soul from controlling the body. It could achieve a near immobilization effect.</p>
<p>The Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light was the most domineering of all. It could directly destroy souls. Once the soul was destroyed, what remained was basically an empty shell.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen suspected that the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light’s ability would clash with the God of Unkilling.</p>
<p>The Soul-Illumination Divine Light was the strangest. This divine light didn’t harm the soul, but it could pull the other party’s soul into the Soul Mirror.</p>
<p>Of course, the strength of the four divine lights depended on the strength of the other party’s soul and whether there were any soul-type Companion Beasts putting up a defense.</p>
<p>The Mirror Deflection ability of the Terror form could reflect the opponent’s attack. The Mirror Realm was also a very strange domain. It could turn everything nearby into a mirror world, but Zhou Wen was still studying its exact effects.</p>
<p>As expected of a Calamity. This ability is too sick! Zhou Wen experimented for a period of time and figured out the various abilities of the Soul Mirror. He planned on taking the Soul Mirror to Mount Laojun to give it a try. Perhaps he could use the Soul Mirror’s power to kill the Azure Bull.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1462'>Chapter 1462 Soul Mirror</h3>
<p>Before heading to Mount Laojun, Zhou Wen went to Venus.</p>
<p>Although the Venusian dimensional zone in reality had been destroyed and half of Venus was gone, the Venusian dimensional zone in-game still existed. Everything in the dungeon was intact.</p>
<p>In reality, Zhou Wen could use Li Mobai’s Ghost God Eyes to lock onto the Calamity gunner’s location.</p>
<p>However, after using the Ghost God Eyes once, they became inoperative and turned into two jade eyeballs that showed zero reaction. Zhou Wen got Li Xuan to take them back and return them to Li Mobai.</p>
<p>He still didn’t understand why the Li family would help them up to this day.</p>
<p>Although his relationship with Li Xuan was indeed good, Li Mobai’s various actions couldn’t be explained by this relationship.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the Ghost God Eyes were useless, even if they could still be used, Zhou Wen couldn’t take them into the game. Therefore, he still couldn’t kill the Calamity gunner in-game.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner had the ability to escape through the metal. Furthermore, his body could fuse with the metal. It was very difficult for Zhou Wen to catch him in the Venusian instance dungeon.</p>
<p>However, things were different with the Soul Mirror. Zhou Wen believed that the Soul Mirror’s ability could restrain the Calamity gunner very well, but he still needed to test it to verify his idea.</p>
<p>After entering the Venusian instance dungeon, Zhou Wen summoned the Soul Mirror and shot a white beam at the Metal Guard. It moved at the true speed of light—the standard speed of a Calamity-grade.</p>
<p>When the white light shone on the Metal Guard, the latter immediately revealed a look of confusion and stopped firing at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Soul Mirror can’t kill. Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon the Golden Battle God to finish off the Metal Guard.</p>
<p>A group of Metal Guards rushed out. Zhou Wen tried the effects of the Soul-Suppression Divine Light next. A black beam shot out from the mirror. The Metal Guards that were illuminated immediately froze as they stood there motionless.</p>
<p>However, once the Soul-Suppression Divine Light moved away from them, they would immediately regain their mobility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen then tried the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. The moment the rainbow beam appeared, the Metal Guard that was illuminated by the beam suddenly collapsed to the ground as though it had lost its soul. It didn’t get up again.</p>
<p>The effects of the Soul-Suppression Divine Light seem to be much weaker than the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. There’s some overlap between the abilities, so it doesn’t seem like there’s any need for it to exist. I wonder if the Soul-Suppression Divine Light has other uses, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light on a Metal Guard. He originally imagined that he would only pull his soul into the mirror, but to his surprise, the Metal Guard’s entire body was moved into the mirror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could see the Metal Guard spinning in the mirror as though it was sleepwalking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it fun, he used the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light to suck the Metal Guards into the mirror. Soon, the Golden Battle Gods came out, but they failed to escape the might of the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light. They were all sucked in.</p>
<p>Seeing the Golden Battle Gods and the Metal Guards spinning in the mirror world like trapped ants on a circle was amusing.</p>
<p>Wait! Zhou Wen looked at the Golden Battle Gods and Metal Guards circling the mirror world as a thought suddenly flashed in his mind. If I suck dimensional creatures in-game, can I release the dimensional creatures I suck in reality?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wished he could quit the game immediately to give it a try, but he decided against it after some thought. He could do it later. He quickly walked into the tunnel.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner’s bullets were blocked by Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation as they spun around him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly moved. By analyzing the trajectory of the Calamity gunner’s bullet, he determined its general location.</p>
<p>After locking onto a certain area, Zhou Wen suddenly used instant transmission. At the same time, he got the Soul Mirror to activate its Mirror World domain.</p>
<p>At that instant, all the nearby metal walls turned into mirrors. The mirrors reflected the blood-colored avatar, but there was no sign of the Soul Mirror.</p>
<p>As there were mirrors everywhere, they reflected each other as though countless blood-colored avatars had appeared.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>A mirror shattered as a black metal robot rushed out of it with a large sniper rifle.</p>
<p>As all the metal walls had turned into mirrors, the Calamity gunner’s Metal Escape technique failed. It was stuck in the mirror-like wall and could only rush out.</p>
<p>It was useless for him to rush out. There were mirrors everywhere and with him unable to use Metal Escape, the Calamity gunner’s mobility was much weaker.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light at the Calamity gunner, but the latter quickly dodged. Despite both being at the Calamity grade, the Soul Mirror’s mirror light was not faster than the Calamity gunner.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was originally somewhat disappointed, believing that he had to rely on himself to kill the Calamity gunner.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the Soul Mirror beside the blood-colored avatar vanished the next second.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror soon appeared in a wall that had turned into a mirror. It used the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light on the Calamity gunner’s back.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner reacted very quickly as he moved and dodged the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. The last time Zhou Wen could stab him, he had used the opportunity of him being unable to move the moment he fired.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that easy to stab him when he wasn’t shooting</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As the Calamity gunner moved, it even fired a shot. The bullet flew towards the Soul Mirror, shattering the mirror wall. Mirror shards flew everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still worried that the Soul Mirror would die just like that, but he suddenly realized that a Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light had shot out from the mirror shards that flew into the sky.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner clearly didn’t expect such a development. It was too late to react as it was illuminated by the rainbow beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly saw the Calamity gunner freeze for a moment, but it didn’t collapse like the Metal Guard. As it roared in pain, it forced itself to move and rushed out of the range of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror was like a ghost in a mirror. It moved in different mirrors and shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light from different spots from time to time, making it impossible to guard against.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner could still withstand the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light in the beginning, but as time went on, after repeatedly being illuminated by the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, its resistance became increasingly weaker. It started to become more sluggish. The Calamity gunner finally lost the ability to dodge the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. Under the continuous illumination of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, it finally collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned Bamboo Blade and chopped off the Calamity gunner’s head.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner’s defense wasn’t high. It was much easier than killing Kui. With a full-powered Immortal Slaying, he managed to behead him.</p>
<p>With the Calamity gunner dead, Zhou Wen was still wondering if a Companion Egg would drop when he heard a boom. The Golden Palace’s door opened.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1463'>Chapter 1463 Something Happened in Guide Ancient City</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had never entered the Golden Palace in reality. In reality, even if he succeeded in clearing the level, the metal ball would automatically fly out of the Golden Palace before transferring out of it.</p>
<p>Even during the final attempt, a stream of energy spewed out of the Golden Palace and injected into the metal ball before the Golden Palace self-destructed. Up to now, no one knew what the Golden Palace looked like.</p>
<p>That was clearly not the case in-game. He wouldn’t obtain the metal ball before reaching the Golden Palace, nor would there be any energy gushing out. In-game, this was the first time the Golden Palace had opened its door, but nothing came out. There was only a resplendent golden light inside, and nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>The Calamity gunner dropped a Strength Crystal which Zhou Wen fed to a Companion Beast. Without any hesitation, he walked through the door and quickly blended into the golden light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared for battle as he pushed the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to its limits.</p>
<p>He guessed that there might be a Golden Wyrm in the Golden Palace, and it might not only be at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw the situation in front of him.</p>
<p>The huge metallic palace was cylindrical. On the surrounding circular walls, there were huge Golden Wyrm statues hanging down at fixed distances. There were a total of thirteen.</p>
<p>All the Golden Wyrms looked down towards the center of the palace with their tails up.</p>
<p>There was a strange metal artifact there. It looked a little like a tripod cauldron, but it didn’t have feet. Furthermore, it was wide at the top and very narrow at the bottom.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the strange metal artifact, the door automatically closed. He then saw the Golden Wyrm statues come to life.</p>
<p>The Golden Wyrms swooped down at Zhou Wen. In the air, they transformed into shears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly took out the Soul Mirror, but the Soul Mirror only managed to illuminate one of the shears with the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. The other scissors had already arrived beside him.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>A few shears snipped at the Soul Mirror, shattering it.</p>
<p>The shears possessed potent destructive power. The Soul Mirror’s defense wasn’t weak at the Human Realm, but it couldn’t even withstand three strikes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that summoning other Companion Beasts wasn’t of much use now, so he decided to circulate the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation with all his might and donned the Dragon King armor.</p>
<p>The Dragon King armor was transformed from the Limitless Demon Dragon King. Although its defense couldn’t compare to the Prisoned Dragon armor, it had a very powerful ability. It could combine the powers of different creatures.</p>
<p>With the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s Limitless Wheel, Zhou Wen could share the strength of eight Companion Beasts. With their strength, he was essentially nine in one. Unfortunately, the Soul Mirror had just been shattered. Otherwise, with the power of the Soul Mirror, Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation would have been even stronger.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had borrowed the power of eight Terror-grade Companion Beasts and had similarly obtained a huge improvement. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation’s range was much bigger.</p>
<p>The shears formed by the Golden Wyrms rushed in front of Zhou Wen and ended up trapped by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They constantly spun around Zhou Wen, failing to injure him.</p>
<p>There’s a chance! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The thirteen shears charged one after another into the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, but they failed to break through.</p>
<p>Thirteen sharp golden beams rapidly spun around Zhou Wen like circles of golden light.</p>
<p>My Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation is the nemesis of such physical offensive weapons. As expected of a skill I developed. It only needs one word to describe it-strong. Zhou Wen was somewhat smug.</p>
<p>A Terror-grade creature could withstand the siege of thirteen Calamity-grade creatures without being damaged at all. Anyone would be somewhat smug.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen could only trap them and didn’t have the ability to kill them. All he could do was watch them charge left and right in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Array.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my Golden Wyrm is still giving birth. Otherwise, I could have tried killing them. Bamboo Blade is only at the Terror grade after all. I probably won’t be able to gain an advantage when facing a Calamity-grade shear. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and ignored the shears as he walked towards the metal artifact in the middle of the hall.</p>
<p>Apart from the thirteen Golden Wyrms, there was only one artifact in the hall. Zhou Wen wanted to see if there was anything inside. His senses were sharp, much less Truth Listener’s, but he couldn’t sense what was inside the metal artifact.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to approach the metal artifact. After taking a few steps, he suddenly saw a strange light flash from it. Before Zhou Wen could figure out what had happened, the game screen went black.</p>
<p>What the hell was that? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He didn’t even understand how he had died.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he could only enter the Venusian instance dungeon once a day. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to continue studying it, he had to wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>He summoned the Soul Mirror but didn’t discover the Metal Guards or the Golden Battle Gods in it. Zhou Wen was even more disappointed.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the dimensional creatures that are stored in the mirror world in-game can’t be brought to the real world. Zhou Wen put away the Soul Mirror and was about to head to Mount Laojun to take a look when he suddenly heard An Sheng’s voice.</p>
<p>“Young Master, there’s news from Guide City. It’s said that a large number of break-out creatures have rushed out of Guide Ancient City,” An Sheng said outside his room.</p>
<p>“Guide Ancient City has been breached? How’s the situation now?” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he hurriedly opened the door and asked An Sheng</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City was called Ancient Sovereign City in-game. Even The Thearch wanted the stone saber there.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even dare pull out the stone saber. With the stone saber’s suppression, it was unlikely for Guide Ancient City’s seal to undergo a break-out. Now that a large number of break-out creatures had suddenly appeared, Zhou Wen was afraid that someone had pulled out the stone saber.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if others pulled out the stone saber. Zhou Wen was most afraid that the stone saber would fall into The Thearch’s hands.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t good. In the past, there were only some low-level dimensional creatures in Guide Ancient City. Even Epic creatures were rare. However, among the dimensional creatures that rushed out this time, there are many Mythical creatures. The local garrison can’t deal with them at all. They are retreating in defeat. Overseer has already sent reinforcements.” An Sheng gave a situation report. “Ah Sheng, help me inform Sis Lan that I won’t be eating with her tonight. I need to return to Guide City.” Zhou Wen walked out of the door and wanted to teleport over, but after some hesitation, he decided to take Chick along.</p>
<p>There were many skeleton creatures in Guide Ancient City. Chick’s phoenix flames were the nemesis of such creatures.</p>
<p>I hope the stone saber is still there! Zhou Wen used his teleportation ability and headed for the vicinity of Guide Ancient City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1464'>Chapter 1464 Rainstorm Cleansing</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s long-distance teleportation still had some level of deviations. He teleported to a spot about fifteen kilometers away from Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>There were a large number of skeleton soldiers wandering around. Dozens of them rushed over when they saw Zhou Wen appear. Zhou Wen waved his hand and killed all the nearby skeleton soldiers before quickly instant transmitting. However, he wasn’t instant transmitting in the direction of Guide Ancient City, but his alma mater, Guide High School.</p>
<p>With so many skeleton soldiers appearing, it meant that the situation in Guide City was probably terrible. Compared to the stone saber, he was more worried about Yu Qiubai’s safety.</p>
<p>After the former principal left, Yu Qiubai had taken good care of him. If not for Yu Qiubai’s introduction, he wouldn’t have known Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Although Ouyang Lan would definitely let him enter Sunset College even if he didn’t team up with Li Xuan, that wasn’t what Zhou Wen wanted. He wanted to enter through his own efforts. Otherwise, he would rather not be enrolled.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, Yu Qiubai lived in the school’s staff dormitory. He had a wife, but he didn’t have any children. If he hadn’t moved out, he could be found the moment Zhou Wen returned to school.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s speed, it only took him the blink of an eye to travel twenty to thirty kilometers. When he arrived at Guide High School, he saw that it had turned into a battlefield. Soldiers were fighting Skeleton Soldiers on the streets.</p>
<p>With the school as the base, the soldiers and the teachers were fighting waves of Skeleton Soldiers and Skeleton Generals.</p>
<p>There were hordes of Skeleton Soldiers everywhere on the streets. There were also quite a number of Skeleton Generals. There were even some Skeleton Generals that were emitting flames. They were all Epic existences.</p>
<p>The school’s defense line was retreating in defeat and could collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw Yu Qiubai at a glance. Yu Qiubai was only at the Epic stage, but now, he was riding on a wild goose and shooting arrows from midair. He was engaged in a battle with a blood-colored caped and blood-stained armor-wearing general riding a skeleton horse.</p>
<p>Although it was called a battle, Yu Qiubai was only trying to attract the general’s attention and prevent him from rushing towards the school. The general had already reached the Mythical stage. This was only a high school. Among the teachers and reinforcing soldiers, there was no one who could match him.</p>
<p>The general raised the spear in his hand into the sky as the blood flames tore through the air. Yu Qiubai had to use all his might to dodge the attack.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai was already injured in several spots. The wild goose beneath him had also been injured, making the battle extremely strenuous. As he attracted the general’s attention, he shouted, “Run… Take the back door…”</p>
<p>The students on campus retreated from the back door under the cover of the soldiers. However, although there weren’t any Mythical generals at the back door, there were still hordes of skeletons. Most of the soldiers and teachers were fighting at the main entrance. Only a small number of soldiers were here. After a few attempts, they failed to charge out.</p>
<p>Many timid girls were already crying. Many of the men were on the brink of collapse. The soldiers also knew that under such circumstances, it was only a matter of time before the defense line was breached. If there were no reinforcements, probably no one here could escape alive.</p>
<p>However, there were skeleton creatures everywhere in Guide City. Reinforcements were needed everywhere. Who could spare their forces to help them?</p>
<p>“Old Wu, lead Bravo Team to the back door and forge a path. Help those students rush out and lead them to the administrative area in the east.”</p>
<p>“Captain, we can’t hold on any longer. If we leave, are we going to give up on this defense line?” Old Wu, who was covered in blood, shouted as he killed.</p>
<p>“The defense line will be breached sooner or later. When the time comes, we will all die. Let’s hold on for a while. Escape with them and forge a way out. Every life saved is an achievement in itself.” The captain’s Essence Gold bullets had been used up. He held his Companion Beast saber and slashed with all his might. “If we leave, you are all dead!” Old Wu refused to retreat. “If you don’t leave, all of us will be dead. Go. This is an order. Take those students east. They should be able to last for a while longer. As long as we can last until the reinforcements arrive, a few of us will survive…” “I’m not leaving. If we die, we die together. Death is only a matter of time. Wait for reinforcements? My ass! Who around Guide City can reinforce us?” Old Wu continued fighting with all his might as he roared.</p>
<p>The captain still wanted to say something, but after opening his blood-stained lips, he ultimately held his tongue.</p>
<p>In the nearby area, the strongest military force was in Guide City. Now that Guide City couldn’t even fend for itself, who could reinforce them?</p>
<p>The only exception was the Sunset Army’s reinforcements. However, Luoyang was too far from Guide City. They wouldn’t be able to last long enough for the Sunset Army to arrive.</p>
<p>“Captain, I heard that there was a famous general in Guide City, Zhang Xun, who defended the city without retreating. He defended the city without any rations internally or any reinforcements externally. With hundreds of soldiers, he held off tens of thousands of rebel soldiers outside the city and fought more than four hundred bloody battles without being defeated. He managed to defend half of the Great Tang dynasty. Although we don’t have Zhang Xun’s abilities, to be able to die in battle on the same land as him, we might not be considered heroes, but we can be considered as people following in the footsteps of heroes, right?” Old Wu shouted as he continued killing.</p>
<p>The captain gave a wry smile and said, “If it’s possible, I’d rather you not be that hero.”</p>
<p>“So what if we die? Who doesn’t die? We brothers will have company in our eternal peace. We won’t be lonely on the way…” As Old Wu spoke, he saw the defense line breach. A tide of skeletons surged into the school.</p>
<p>“It’s over!” The soldiers and teachers looked at the skeleton legion that charged in like predators. They knew that the situation was hopeless, and their eyes were filled with despair. Yu Qiubai sighed and looked into the school. Not only were his students there, but his wife was also there.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange buzzing sound sounded in the air. It was as though countless bees were flapping their wings and flying, but no one saw them.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>The horde of skeletons that rushed into the school was instantly shattered by an invisible force that descended from the sky. Large swaths of them were instantly diced into fragments.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the school. The tidal-like skeletons outside were also diced to pieces by the power that descended from the sky. Be it the lowest-level Skeleton Soldiers or the flaming Skeleton Generals, none of them could withstand a single strike.</p>
<p>It was as though an invisible sword rain had enveloped the entire land, instantly destroying all the skeletons as though it was purging the land.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Everyone watched in a daze as the waves of skeletons were killed. Even the seemingly invincible Mythical skeleton general failed to withstand the invisible force. His body was sliced into pieces by the invisible sword beams that descended from the sky.</p>
<p>Everyone looked into the sky and saw a figure levitating there. His clothes and black hair fluttered in the wind. He was the one who had released the invisible sword beams that purged the land like a storm.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Yu Qiubai couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised when he saw the figure.</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m sorry for being late,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment when he arrived in front of Yu Qiubai. All the skeletons within his reach had been killed. The distant skeleton legion had yet to charge over.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1465'>Chapter 1465 Ancient City Anomaly</h3>
<p>“It’s good that you’re back.” Looking at the youth in front of him, Yu Qiubai had a thousand things to say, but he was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
<p>The youth who had painstakingly left this place had finally returned. However, he was no longer the same Zhou Wen from back then. No one had expected such a scene to happen today.</p>
<p>“Sir, guard the school for now. Don’t leave the area to go out. I’ll be back soon,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned two Terror-form Golden Battle Gods to stand guard outside the school. He then flew towards the distant skeleton horde.</p>
<p>As the Golden Battle Gods had already undergone Terror transformation, ordinary people couldn’t see them.</p>
<p>The soldiers and teachers saw Zhou Wen fly into the sky and charge at a skeleton legion in the distance. Wherever he passed, the skeleton legion collapsed like dust washed away by a storm.</p>
<p>“That… looks like Zhou Wen, right? Why is he here?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know? Zhou Wen graduated from our school.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, for real? Zhou Wen was from our school?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that obvious? Didn’t you hear how he greeted our principal? He used to be a student under him.”</p>
<p>“In that case, Zhou Wen is our senior?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, I think that Mythical creature dropped a Companion Egg. He didn’t even pick it up!”</p>
<p>“There are many dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs outside. They are everywhere!”</p>
<p>Old Wu held a wrinkled cigarette in his mouth as he took a deep drag and spat it out. He looked in the direction Zhou Wen had flown in and said, “Talent is really desirable! Talent allows you to do whatever you want. I love it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wiped out the nearby skeleton legion, but he still saw skeleton creatures rushing out of Guide Ancient City. He knew that if he didn’t resolve the problem of Guide Ancient City, it would be useless no matter how many skeletons he killed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of the skeleton creatures had been wiped out by him with only a few escaping. The skeletons that rushed out of Guide Ancient City were unable to form a legion.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen flew in the direction of Guide Ancient City, hoping to root out the problem.</p>
<p>Guide Ancient City hadn’t had any obvious changes to its appearance since Zhou Wen first entered. However, there were skeleton creatures everywhere. Even the moat was filled with skeletons, as though it was a river that led to hell.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure streaked across the sky as large swaths of skeleton creatures were culled. Plenty of dimensional crystals dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to pick up the low-level dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs as he charged straight for the ancient city’s door. After rushing into the ancient city, Zhou Wen realized that ancient buildings stretched out like a mountain range. The ancient city was many times bigger than before with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the skeleton creatures had come out from inside the ancient city, but after entering, he realized that there weren’t any skeleton creatures in the ancient city. In fact, most of the skeleton creatures had crawled out from the ground and moat outside the city.</p>
<p>Strange, why don’t I see a single skeleton creature? Zhou Wen looked around. Unlike the flames of war outside, the ancient city was terrifyingly quiet. It was virtually silent, as though it was a different world from the outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen failed to discover a single creature in the city the entire time.</p>
<p>He found it somewhat odd. All he could do was don the Prisoned Dragon armor and stick the Substitute Talisman on him. He continued keeping the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around at its limits before heading for the Fire God Platform.</p>
<p>As the ancient city was many times bigger than before, the possibility of the Fire God Platform still being in its original spot wasn’t high, but the general direction couldn’t be wrong.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen swept past the roofs of the ancient buildings. To his surprise, they seemed to be enveloped by a mysterious force. Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t hear anything inside.</p>
<p>There was nothing. Apart from the ancient buildings that resembled a palace complex, this place seemed to be a ghost city. Zhou Wen didn’t see anything as he traveled.</p>
<p>I’ve finally found it! Zhou Wen finally discovered the Fire God Platform. It hadn’t changed much and still looked the same. It didn’t seem different from the last time he came.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen went straight to the Fire God Platform and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he found the stone saber still embedded in the furnace.</p>
<p>Strange, the stone saber is still there. It wasn’t pulled out. Why did the ancient city undergo such a large-scale breakout? Furthermore, the ancient city itself has undergone a huge change? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>The first reason Zhou Wen hadn’t pulled out the saber was that he was afraid that it would lead to the destruction of Guide City. Secondly, it was also because of The Thearch.</p>
<p>However, there was another important reason. Zhou Wen knew that only people who had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra could pull out the stone saber. It wasn’t that easy to gain basic mastery in the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Furthermore, to pull out the stone saber, one needed to reach the Mythical stage with the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Otherwise, The Thearch wouldn’t have specially negotiated with him.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra wasn’t a Qi Refinement Art. One couldn’t raise it by loading up resources, so Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried about the stone saber being pulled out.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the stone saber hadn’t been pulled out.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He subconsciously turned around.</p>
<p>A figure was standing on the roof of an ancient building amidst the stretch of buildings, staring at him.</p>
<p>Humanoid dimensional creature? Zhou Wen’s heart tightened. Among dimensional creatures, there weren’t many that were similar to humans in size, but the more human-like a dimensional creature was, the more terrifying it was. For example, the main gods of many pantheons were in human form. Although there were some exceptions, Zhou Wen still paid attention to humanoid creatures. The dimensional creature on the roof was no different from a human. He was tall and muscular, and his hair was disheveled. He was covered in animal hide, and his exposed skin showed a healthy tan.</p>
<p>None of these mattered. The main point was that Zhou Wen sensed a special aura from him. This aura was something only people who cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had. The other party was a dimensional creature; yet, he actually had the aura of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. This was somewhat strange.</p>
<p>The dimensional creature was casually standing on the roof, but it had an aura that made it appear like an apex predator. It made Zhou Wen feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flicked his finger and the Bamboo Blade that had transformed into a ring bounced out. Like a bent spring, it instantly returned to its straight form. It was already the size of the normal Bamboo Blade by the time it landed in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade and stared at the humanoid dimensional creature. The ominous feeling didn’t weaken.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1466'>Chapter 1466 Terrifying Humanoid Dimensional Creature</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the Immortal Culling Sword as well. He held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and the Immortal Culling Sword in the other as he stared intently at the humanoid dimensional creature.</p>
<p>The humanoid dimensional creature stared at Zhou Wen as it exerted strength in its legs. Instantly, its figure blurred and vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without any hesitation, he used instant transmission and headed for the ancient city’s exit.</p>
<p>How terrifying was a speed that even his vision couldn’t keep up?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, his heart skipped a beat. He saw the humanoid creature standing in front of him with its nose almost touching his. Its black pupils met Zhou Wen’s pupils as its long gray hair swayed slightly in the wind.</p>
<p>The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation failed to show an effect? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he quickly retreated. He wanted to simultaneously draw both the Bamboo Blade and Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>There was only one possibility for his opponent to ignore the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. The other party’s strength was enough to tear through the void.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could draw the saber and sword, the humanoid creature pressed down with both hands and forcefully sheathed the saber and sword back. At the same time, it turned around and kicked Zhou Wen in the chest.</p>
<p>These actions were done in one fell swoop, so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t react despite seeing him move. His body flew out like a cannonball and slammed into a wall.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An ancient building collapsed under Zhou Wen’s weight. Despite having Absolute Defense, his Prisoned Dragon armor had a footprint-shaped hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sternum fractured in numerous areas. All his bones seemed to have fallen apart during the collision. If not for the Prisoned Dragon armor’s protection, all his bones would have shattered.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen endured the pain from his injuries and instant transmitted away. Almost at the same time, the collapsed building was blasted apart by a terrifying force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ducked left the moment he finished instant transmission. At the same time, he pointed an ancient mirror at the spot where he had appeared, shooting out rainbow beams.</p>
<p>The humanoid creature was already there as expected. At such a close distance and with the Soul Mirror’s mirror beam traveling at the speed of light, the humanoid creature’s reaction time was minute, almost negligiblein theory.</p>
<p>Despite being so close, the humanoid creature managed to react. Its figure blurred in Zhou Wen’s vision as it dodged the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the Soul Mirror’s divine light to stop, Zhou Wen used instant transmission. He knew that he was in deep sh*t.</p>
<p>To be able to dodge the Soul Mirror’s light at such a distance meant that he was at least at the Hell level or above. He might even be at the Heaven Realm.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that the other party’s strength came from the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. It was unadulterated physical strength. To be able to cultivate his body to such a level, be it speed or strength, was not something Zhou Wen could match.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to follow up his instant transmission with another. The gap between them wasn’t even a tenth of a second, but in that split second, he was grabbed by the humanoid creature and punched in the face.</p>
<p>Half of the Prisoned Dragon helmet cratered in, along with half of Zhou Wen’s face as his body flew to the side.</p>
<p>In midair, before Zhou Wen even slammed into the wall, the humanoid creature appeared in front of him again and kicked his head.</p>
<p>Half of Zhou Wen’s face was deformed as his cheekbones collapsed. His head had been severely injured and the other party’s speed was very fast, but Zhou Wen ultimately reacted. When he was in midair, he used another instant transmission.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The humanoid creature had already sent a punch over the moment he phased into existence, giving him no chance to dodge. However, Zhou Wen crossed his saber and sword and blocked the incoming punch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the humanoid creature had immense strength. The saber and sword slammed into Zhou Wen’s chest, sending him flying. He lost his grip on the saber and sword as they fell. Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to draw them out of their scabbards. Otherwise, the saber and sword would have sliced him apart. He might have been diced to pieces.</p>
<p>“Come out!” Zhou Wen summoned a Golden Battle God and shielded himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, the humanoid creature had already arrived behind him and struck at the Golden Battle God. The Terror-grade Golden Battle God was shattered by his strike as his palm continued in its trajectory towards Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>Using the instant he won from sacrificing the Golden Battle God, Zhou Wen finally instant transmitted out again. The Soul Mirror he had thrown into the air also shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light at the humanoid creature.</p>
<p>It was useless. His speed was too fast. The Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light couldn’t keep up with him.</p>
<p>The humanoid figure flashed behind the Soul Mirror and threw a punch at it.</p>
<p>With the strength of his fist, even the Soul Mirror probably couldn’t withstand it. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had expected this and had already unsummoned the Soul Mirror ahead of time. When his fist struck down, the Soul Mirror transformed into a stream of light that returned to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately summoned it again. He held the Soul Mirror with both hands and activated the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light.</p>
<p>The four types of divine light traveled at the speed of light. In theory, their speeds were the same, but Zhou Wen felt that the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light was clearly faster than the other three types of divine light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directed the Soul Mirror to emit divine light in the direction where the humanoid creature wasn’t standing, but when the divine light shot out, the humanoid creature appeared in its path.</p>
<p>Success! Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that he had successfully predicted the humanoid creature’s movement.</p>
<p>If the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light could store the humanoid creature in the Soul Mirror, his life would be saved.</p>
<p>However, when the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light shone on the humanoid creature, he only paused for a moment before immediately rushing out of its range. What the hell is this fellow? Why would such a creature appear in Guide Ancient City? Zhou Wen didn’t just want to vomit blood-in fact, blood kept gushing out of his mouth as half his face was mangled. He threw out the Soul Mirror with his left hand and grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword with his right hand. Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed backwards with Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>The humanoid creature was indeed there. When it saw Zhou Wen slash at it, it didn’t dodge. It extended its hand and grabbed at the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The sword beam shattered like glass. The humanoid creature’s palm grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade without suffering any damage.</p>
<p>It’s over! Just as Zhou Wen had this thought, he felt an unstoppable force coming from the hilt.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was thrown into the air and smashed into the ground, shattering the stone slabs there. The stone fragments mixed with the armor fragments flew up. As for Zhou Wen who was spitting out blood, his eyes were bloodshot as his body rapidly plummeted into the ground.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1467'>Chapter 1467 A Narrow Escape</h3>
<p>As he was smashed into the ground, Zhou Wen used the Chaos Egg to protect himself. This was his strongest defense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Spacetime Bandit inside the Chaos Egg and slashed out Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg bounced upon hitting the bottom. The power of Immortal Slaying under the effects of Spacetime Bandit was simultaneously released from its previous spot and slashed at the spot where the humanoid monster was standing.</p>
<p>Even the Soul Mirror’s speed couldn’t keep up with the humanoid monster, much less Immortal Slaying’s speed.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster’s body flashed. Not only did he dodge the power of Immortal Slaying, but he also appeared above the Chaos Egg. He clenched his fingers into a fist and punched the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was severely deformed and nearly turned into an awl. It slammed into the ground, blasting open a huge crater. The Chaos Egg didn’t shatter as it bounced back and bounced everywhere in the ancient building.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was instantly filled with solid Essence Energy crystals. They inflated the Chaos Egg, pushing it to the brink.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Another punch struck the Chaos Egg, causing it to explode. The Essence Energy Crystals inside exploded like stars as Zhou Wen’s body fell out.</p>
<p>Blood spewed out of Zhou Wen’s mouth amidst his horror. Even the Chaos Egg had only managed to block two punches. With his damaged body, he probably couldn’t even withstand a single strike. Even if he wasn’t hit in a vital spot, he would probably die. Sigh of the King… I’ll really die if you don’t come out… From the looks of it, I can only use that move… Zhou Wen had already predicted the location of the humanoid monster’s appearance, but in his present state, he couldn’t even dodge. Even if he barely teleported, he would probably be killed by the humanoid monster the moment he phased into existence.</p>
<p>Instead of dying when the time came, he might as well risk it and use his ultimate move.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster instantly arrived at a speed beyond Zhou Wen’s senses. Zhou Wen stopped looking and summoned all his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“Truth Listener… Come out…” Zhou Wen’s will shouted crazily, but Truth Listener in its earring form remained unmoved. It had no intention of coming out.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>In an instant, countless Companion Beasts that stood in front of the humanoid monster were killed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, when Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beasts, he deliberately placed them like the Golden Battle God Halberd on the front. His main combat pets like Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate were summoned to the side.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. He bent his legs and wanted to kneel down to force the silent Sigh of the King out. At this critical moment, he couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>However, the humanoid monster was too fast. Just as Zhou Wen’s knees bent, the humanoid monster’s fist arrived in front of him.</p>
<p>Oh no, it’s too late! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although Banana Fairy and the other Companion Beasts had already attacked the humanoid monster’s location with all their might, Banana Fairy’s terrifying Chaos Wind and Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World failed to injure him. To the humanoid monster, the Chaos Wind was no different from a breeze in spring. It couldn’t even stop him for an instant.</p>
<p>Just as the blurry fist was about to land on Zhou Wen’s face, it suddenly stopped as though something had blocked it. However, there was nothing in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>That humanoid monster suddenly showed kindness? Or did he suddenly realize that I resemble his long-lost father and can’t bear to attack me? Zhou Wen saw the monster stop there with its fist hanging in front of him without advancing. Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Ring!</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, the attacks of Banana Fairy and the other Companion Beasts landed on the humanoid monster, but they were useless.</p>
<p>However, when a strange chime sounded, the humanoid monster suddenly hugged his head as though he was in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he was delighted. He looked up and saw Demonic Neonate holding the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand. She was rapidly shaking it. The sound waves that undulated from the Heaven Shrouding Bell spread out like water ripples, forming a strange spatial barrier. No senses could pass through the barrier formed by the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy, Torch Dragon, Limitless Demon Dragon King, and other attacks constantly struck the humanoid creature, but he didn’t dodge or counterattack. All he did was hug his head with both hands as his body constantly trembled.</p>
<p>However, the attacks were useless against the humanoid monster. Even when the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Light shone on the humanoid monster, it only made him roar as though he was in extreme pain. It didn’t wipe away his soul.</p>
<p>“Neonate, well done!” No matter how stupid Zhou Wen was, he could tell that the power that really affected the humanoid monster was the Heaven Shrouding Bell in Demonic Neonate’s hand.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate hadn’t used the Heaven Shrouding Bell much since she had obtained it. She had never used it against powerful creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power had weakened in her hands. After all, Demonic Neonate’s level was too low. It was normal for the Heaven Shrouding Bell she had absorbed to suffer a loss in level.</p>
<p>He never expected the Heaven Shrouding Bell to be effective at such a critical moment.</p>
<p>“Neonate, continue maintaining it.” Zhou Wen unsummoned his Companion Beasts and only left Soul Mirror and Demonic Neonate out. The Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light was still effective against the humanoid monster.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated towards the ancient city’s exit as Demonic Neonate rang the bell. At the same time, he picked up the Immortal Culling Sword that had flown out of his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed the humanoid monster as he retreated. The Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power didn’t injure him, but what puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power wasn’t a psyche attack, but from the looks of it, the humanoid monster seemed to be suffering from a psyche attack.</p>
<p>Strange, the Heaven Shrouding Bell is clearly a spatial power. How can it have such an effect? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>The Soul Mirror’s attacks were clearly psychic in nature, but its effects weren’t as good as the Heaven Shrouding Bell.</p>
<p>Although the Heaven Shrouding Bell was indeed effective, it didn’t seem like it could kill the humanoid monster. All Zhou Wen wanted to do now was leave Guide Ancient City and survive.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster kept hugging his head and trembling. In the beginning, he would let out a low roar due to the power of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. However, behind him, only his body trembled. There was silence.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that his vitality had weakened. On the contrary, the humanoid monster showed no signs of dying. Instead, his vitality increased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to reach the entrance. Just as he was about to unsummon Demonic Neonate and the Soul Mirror before escaping, he suddenly heard a voice. “Wait, child.” Zhou Wen’s body shook as he realized that the humanoid monster had stopped trembling. He straightened his back and stared at him. The person who spoke was none other than the humanoid monster.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1468'>Chapter 1468 Demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra</h3>
<p>“Child, don’t be afraid. I won’t harm you. At least not now,” the humanoid monster said faintly as he stood there without any intention of attacking Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept his back against the door. Although he didn’t immediately rush out, he was fully focused. If anything went wrong, he would immediately rush out the door.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the humanoid monster. He could sense that the humanoid monster was somewhat different from before, but he couldn’t tell what was different.</p>
<p>“I’m no longer worthy of having a name.” The humanoid monster sighed and said, “Child, I don’t have much time. I have some questions for you. In this world, are humans still human?” “What else can humans be if they aren’t humans?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster seemed to understand something as he said in enlightenment, “Are there still pure-blooded humans in this world?”</p>
<p>“Am I not a pure-blooded human?” Seeing that the Soul Mirror was useless against him, Zhou Wen wanted to unsummon it. “Don’t unsummon the mirror. Its existence gives me more time,” the humanoid monster seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts and spoke first.</p>
<p>The Heaven Shrouding Bell in Demonic Neonate’s heart continued to shake without any intention of stopping.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as though he had figured out something. He got the Soul Mirror to continue spewing out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light at the humanoid monster.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster sized up Zhou Wen and shook its head. “No, you aren’t a pure human. Although I can’t sense the dimension’s bloodline in you, pure humans are unable to break through the limits of the Deva Realm. As for you, you have long passed the limits of the Deva Realm.”</p>
<p>“What’s the Deva Realm? Are you referring to the advancement to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen pondered.</p>
<p>“Mythical? You can say that.” The humanoid monster thought for a moment and nodded slightly. Then, it asked, “Are there any pure-blooded humans left in this world?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Can you tell me who you are?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I’m ashamed to continue having a name.” The humanoid monster refused to say anything. He sighed and said, “As long as there are pure-blooded humans, there’s still hope. Although the chances are slim, there’s still a chance.”</p>
<p>After a pause, the humanoid monster pondered and said, “Child, I don’t have much time left. Now, you have to remember every word I say. Although you aren’t a pure human, human blood flows in you. Remember my words. Tell it to every human. This will affect the fate of the entire human race.” “Tell me.” Zhou Wen sized up the humanoid monster in puzzlement, guessing his origins and how trustworthy his words were.</p>
<p>“Firstly, humans have to maintain a pure bloodline. Under no circumstances are they to fuse with dimensional bloodlines. Otherwise, the entire human race will be wiped out.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gaped his mouth to say something, but he was interrupted by the humanoid monster. Then, he continued, “Secondly, kill all the invading dimensional creatures. We can’t let them control the land.”</p>
<p>“Third, find a ship with such a mark. There’s a woman on that ship. Kill her,” the humanoid monster said as he extended his finger and drew a symbol on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nearly cried out when he saw the symbol.</p>
<p>This was because the symbol drawn by the humanoid monster was the symbol of the anchor and the woman’s side profile.</p>
<p>“The woman you want killed is the woman in the symbol?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the drawing on the ground.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The humanoid monster nodded slightly. “You have to do these three things. If you can’t do any of them, the entire human race might very well be destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Why must these three things be done? Who’s that woman?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. I don’t have that much time. I’ll next demonstrate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra for you. This is the second half of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. With this second half, pure humans will have a chance to break through the limit of the Deva Realm. Although it’s still extremely unlikely, there’s still that rare chance…”</p>
<p>As the humanoid monster spoke, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra over his body bloomed. One could clearly sense the Essence Energy circulation in his body. “Everything in the world has its specialty. The tiger has claws; the bird has wings; the fish has scales and gills, but only humans don’t have any specialties. They don’t have sharp claws or teeth, nor do they have wings that can fly, nor do they have the ability to secrete poison, much less survive in water. Humans are so incompatible in this world as though they don’t belong to this world.”</p>
<p>The humanoid monster continued while circulating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, “As long as everything in the world evolves to a certain level, they can easily break through the limits of the Deva Realm. However, no matter how hard humans work, they are unable to break through this step. Countless human sages have tried their best their entire lives, but they failed to take that step.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign once comprehended the Dao. He said that the land is a cage for humans. Humans are trapped here to suffer all kinds of suffering. It’s difficult for them to transcend even across generations. They are nothing but prisoners.” The power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra over the humanoid monster became stronger and stronger. He was like a sun that emitted a terrifying vitality.</p>
<p>“Only by exceeding the limits of the Deva Realm can one be liberated from this cage of suffering. However, the human body seems to be shackled, or perhaps it has some flaws. Even a genius can’t break through the limits of the Deva Realm by themselves.”</p>
<p>When the humanoid monster said that, he became spirited. “I transformed into a devil and broke through the limits of the Deva Realm. Although this body has been crippled and I can’t recover my human body, I’ve also figured out a way to help my race break through the shackles. I’ve completed the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and obtained a sliver of life for the human race. You have to remember this method and pass it on to the world. As long as a pure human can advance to the Mythical stage, it will be the hope of all humanity…”</p>
<p>“Well… Can I interrupt…” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything else. Listen to me and sense my realm. Although you can no longer cultivate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, as a human evangelist of the Dao, you will definitely leave your name in history…” The humanoid monster then demonstrated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra as he chanted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to tell the humanoid monster that he was a pure-blooded human, but he failed to interject.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster’s strength was unimaginably terrifying. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra he demonstrated had a domineering aura that defied the heavens. Zhou Wen could even sense the scene of a battle forged through blood and fire, one that could collapse the world.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra he recited was something that wasn’t on the monument.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen however realized that the supplementary parts of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra were clearly different from what he had figured out.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra only had content after the Mythical stage, so Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was a path he had taken himself. The other party had also taken a path himself. The two paths were completely different.</p>
<p>Despite having the same foundation, the Essence Energy Art developed in two completely different directions.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1469'>Chapter 1469 Two Versions of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen watched the humanoid monster demonstrate. Although the humanoid monster’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was different from his, the other party’s realm and level were much higher than his. He could draw some experience from him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss after watching for some time. Although the humanoid monster’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was indeed very powerful and high-level, it was too different from Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra. There wasn’t much point in referencing it. “Excuse me…” Zhou Wen wanted to ask the question on his mind.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak. Engrave every word I say firmly in your soul. These are the fruits of labor earned from the sacrifices of generations of human sages. You have to pass it down. It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand it. Just remember it…” The humanoid monster’s expression was solemn as he continued demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue listening as he thought to himself, Even if it’s useless for me, I can find a human to inherit this Essence Energy Art in the future.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s demonstration, the aura of the humanoid creature was so powerful that it nearly broke through the firmaments.</p>
<p>This was thankfully a dimensional zone. If they were outside, it would probably quake areas thousands of kilometers away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, however, vaguely felt that with the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s demonstration, the aura of the humanoid creature gradually began to turn odd. If it was purely the Ancient Sovereign’s aura in the beginning, it was almost impossible to tell if he was a human or a dimensional creature. The dimensional creature’s aura became more and more obvious with time.</p>
<p>The humanoid creature finally finished demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and stopped. The aura from his body continued surging like a stormy sea.</p>
<p>“Have you memorized it? There’s not much time left. If there’s anything you can’t remember, quickly ask.” The humanoid creature seemed to be enduring some pain as his voice trembled.</p>
<p>“I’ve memorized it, but I have an important question to ask,” Zhou Wen said as he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to prevent the humanoid creature from interrupting him again.</p>
<p>The sun-like Ancient Sovereign appeared in front of Zhou Wen before he asked, “I’ve also cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the stone monument, but the path I took later was somewhat different from what you demonstrated. It’s even at odds with yours. Can you tell me why?”.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster wanted to interrupt him when he heard the first half of the sentence, hoping to finish explaining everything as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, his eyes widened as he lost control of his emotions and cried out when he saw the Human Sovereign projection that Zhou Wen had summoned. “How is this possible? You managed to raise the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to the Terror grade? But I can’t sense any dimensional power from you. That’s impossible!”</p>
<p>Sovereign Sutra was actually simulated in the beginning. As long as he didn’t switch to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, he wouldn’t possess the aura of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Although the humanoid monster had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to an extremely high realm, he still couldn’t sense it.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe it when he suddenly saw Zhou Wen summon the Human Sovereign projection.</p>
<p>“Yes, it hasn’t been long since my Ancient Sovereign Sutra advanced to the Terror grade, but there’s a problem with it. Anyone injured by the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra will rapidly recover from their injuries. Even an ant can’t be killed. Is there any way to resolve this problem?” Zhou Wen had always found the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s characteristic depressing. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s augmentation of strength was potent, but it couldn’t kill anyone. It was useless no matter how much it strengthened him.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster looked at Zhou Wen with an ambivalent look. He was clearly the monster, but now, he looked at Zhou Wen like he was looking at a monster.</p>
<p>“Are humans nowadays like you? How many people have mastered the Ancient Sovereign Sutra? How many have relied on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to break through the limits of</p>
<p>with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of anyone. Perhaps there might be some, but I don’t know of them.” Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if anyone else had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. The stone monument was sitting right there after all. Anyone could see it. Perhaps someone had mastered it.</p>
<p>“In other words, you learned the Ancient Sovereign Sutra completely independently. No one guided you to reach basic mastery?” the humanoid monster asked again. “No.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “Is there a problem? Could it be that my Ancient Sovereign Sutra can’t injure others because I’ve cultivated it wrongly?” The humanoid monster said with a strange expression, “The ancient Human Sovereign is the sovereign of humanity. Every Human Sovereign is the sovereign that humanity pins its hopes on, and they are willing to sacrifice everything for humanity. Every Human Sovereign has the determination to sacrifice themselves to achieve righteousness. What they want is not to kill, but to let humanity live.”</p>
<p>With that said, the humanoid monster sighed softly. “However, this path isn’t feasible. Even the sovereigns of humanity like Suirenshi and Shennong, who had risked everything for humans, were unable to break through the limits of the Deva Realm. In the end, they had no choice but to sacrifice themselves to transform into a devil and seek other paths. That’s how I have the Ancient Sovereign Sutra I cultivate now.”</p>
<p>The humanoid monster gave Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign a deep look before sighing. “If I had known that someone could cultivate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra with a pure human body, I wouldn’t have taken so many detours.”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. Since they are the sovereigns of humanity, they have to lead the human race to fight foreign enemies. If they can’t kill the enemy, wouldn’t the Ancient Sovereign Sutra be mostly crippled?” Zhou Wen still felt that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra he cultivated was somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>“Sovereigns are different from emperors. Emperors kill, but sovereigns subdue the enemy without fighting. Killing is just a temporary solution, a highly ineffective plan. If one can really make the opponent submit and be used, wouldn’t that be a boon? Rearing livestock and planting food are all ways to turn enemies into friends. They are many times stronger than the person who only knows how to kill. How can they be on the same level?</p>
<p>“Wrong… It’s all wrong… I never expected that the efforts of generations of people, who even</p>
<p>have taken the wrong path…” The humanoid monster’s voice gradually became strange. It was as though he had gradually lost his feelings and had become cold and heartless.</p>
<p>“GO… Live on with your Ancient Sovereign Sutra… I’m almost unable to control this body… Remember the three things I said… If you can’t do it… Don’t ever return to Ancient Sovereign City… Find someone suitable to pass on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra… until someone can do it… Then, let him return to Ancient Sovereign City…” The humanoid monster’s eyes became more and more ferocious as though he had changed into a different person.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen still had many questions to ask, he could tell that the humanoid monster was about to lose control. The Heaven Shrouding Bell’s isolation ability couldn’t help the humanoid monster resist the control of some force.</p>
<p>“Farewell!” Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. He wasn’t the humanoid monster’s match, so he could only escape.</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen unsummoned Demonic Neonate and the Soul Mirror, the humanoid monster completely lost control and vanished. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already instant transmitted with Spacetime Bandit. As he unsummoned his Companion Beasts, he rushed out of Guide City.</p>
<p>The interior and exterior of the city were almost two different worlds. Large numbers of skeleton creatures constantly crawled out of the moat outside the city. There was no lack of Mythical creatures among them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to clean up the nearby skeleton creatures. When he arrived at an uninhabited area in the city, he suddenly shouted, “Come out!”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1470'>Chapter 1470 Touch</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for a while, but no one came out. He said, “Sweetie, I know you’re here. Come out.”</p>
<p>Sweetie walked out of a tree not far away after a while. She lowered her head and avoided eye contact like a child who had made a mistake.</p>
<p>“You were the one who helped me block that punch, right?” Zhou Wen immediately understood that his guess was right when he saw Sweetie.</p>
<p>Before Demonic Neonate could ring the Heaven Shrouding Bell and before Zhou Wen could kneel, the humanoid monster’s fist had suddenly stopped. It definitely wasn’t a coincidence.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that Sweetie was the most likely candidate.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to save you. It’s just a coincidence. Yes, a coincidence.” Sweetie lowered her head and fiddled with her clothes, not daring to look up at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but pity Sweetie when he saw that she was like a child who wasn’t good at expressing herself. He reached out to stroke her hair.</p>
<p>This was because Zhou Wen was an introverted person. Even though he treated others well, he wasn’t willing to say it out loud. Sweetie reminded Zhou Wen of himself.</p>
<p>Sweetie was flustered and didn’t think too much. When Zhou Wen touched her hair, she suddenly recalled that sinners couldn’t be touched-they would be turned into gold.</p>
<p>“No!” Sweetie exclaimed as she retreated. However, she knew that it was too late. She looked at Zhou Wen and was alarmed to discover him standing there with his hand still in the air. He looked extremely puzzled as though he was surprised by Sweetie’s reaction.</p>
<p>“You… you’re fine?” Sweetie realized that Zhou Wen hadn’t turned into gold. He didn’t have any metal on him, much less turn into gold.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Only then did Zhou Wen recall that the people who had turned into gold seemed to be related to Sweetie. He couldn’t help but break out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“Try touching me again.” Sweetie still couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen hadn’t turned into gold when he touched her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was a big baddie from every angle she could tell. He was definitely riddled with sins, but she found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen wouldn’t turn into a golden statue.</p>
<p>“There’s no need, right?” Zhou Wen took half a step back. He was afraid that it had been an accident. An adverse outcome would be bad if he touched her again.</p>
<p>“It’ll be fine.” Sweetie stubbornly walked in front of Zhou Wen and reached out to grab his hand before placing it on her head.</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhou Wen didn’t show any signs of turning into gold. Not only did he not turn into gold, but there was also a mysterious force that quickly healed Zhou Wen’s injuries.</p>
<p>Such serious injuries recovered in just moments. There were no longer any signs of injury.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he heaved a sigh of relief. He bent his fingers slightly and ruffled Sweetie’s hair. “Thank you for saving me. Tell me what you want. I’ll definitely deliver it to you as long as I can obtain it.” Sweetie shook her head and said with a strange expression, “I don’t want anything. Furthermore, I’ve already broken the rules. Someone will soon take me away. I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to meet again in the future.”</p>
<p>“What rules did you violate? Who will take you away? With your abilities, who can take you away if you don’t wish to leave?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Sweetie only shook her head and didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. She pushed away his hand that was pressing on her head and glared at him. “Don’t let me know about any evil you do in the future, or I won’t spare you.” With that said, Sweetie turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Wait.” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and stopped Sweetie.</p>
<p>“What for?” Sweetie turned her head and asked.</p>
<p>“This is yours, right?” Zhou Wen took out the candy box and lemon candy and threw them at Sweetie.</p>
<p>“So it was with you. Where did you get it?” Sweetie caught the candy box and the lemon candy and couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recounted the process of obtaining the candy box and the lemon candy. After Sweetie heard that, she muttered to herself thoughtfully, “I see. So that’s how it is. It’s no wonder I couldn’t find it despite searching for so long. So she stole it.”</p>
<p>“Now that the item has returned to its rightful owner, you should be at ease,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What’s there to worry about? I’ve never been worried.” Sweetie didn’t know why, but she suddenly felt angry. She threw the candy box and lemon candy at Zhou Wen and said angrily, “Who wants your things? Since you painstakingly obtained them, keep them for yourself.”</p>
<p>With that said, she vanished without giving Zhou Wen a chance to speak.</p>
<p>“Since you’re here to find these things, why don’t you want them?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out what Sweetie was up to. However, since it was Sweetie’s, the candy probably wasn’t ordinary. Zhou Wen didn’t dare use it recklessly as he put away the candy and candy box.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen stormed back to the city, he saw that Luoyang’s reinforcements had arrived. They were setting up the defenses, gradually bringing the skeleton army in the vicinity of Guide Ancient City under control.</p>
<p>“Young Master, the situation is already under control. You don’t have to worry.” An Sheng had personally led his men over to provide support. It was obvious that Luoyang valued this matter greatly. “Guide Ancient City has a terrifying creature inside. Don’t let anyone in,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.</p>
<p>“What creature is it?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of creature the humanoid monster was. Perhaps he had been human in the past, but now, he existed as a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>Up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand what the three conditions he mentioned meant. Why were there three conditions?</p>
<p>“Young Master, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to stay in Guide City. Overseer has the intention of migrating everyone in Guide City to Luoyang,” An Sheng whispered.</p>
<p>“Why? Isn’t the situation under control now?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Young Master, you are from Guide City. You should know how many terrifying legends there are in this place. Guide Ancient City is only the beginning. Places like Butterfly Valley will definitely suffer a breakout in the future. Ignoring the fact that Guide City’s military can’t hold the line now, if all the mysteries here break out, they probably won’t be able to hold on even if all of Luoyang’s army is deployed,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew how terrifying the myths in Guide City were. From the ancient mythical era to the feudal dynasty, this place had once been under the dazzling spotlight. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were more or less related to this area. There were also countless famous and virtuous paragons like Lao Tze who were born in this area. The Butterfly Valley with the Essence Crystal mine was also near Guide City. Zhou Wen had always suspected that it had something to do with Master Zhuang.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1471'>Chapter 1471 Sovereign Sui’s Tomb</h3>
<p>Are we abandoning Guide? Zhou Wen looked at the distant Guide Ancient City as he guessed.</p>
<p>Humans were at a disadvantage and were unable to gain a foothold in the vicinity. However, as humanity grew stronger, a place with rich dimensional zones like Guide City would definitely become a place the various factions would vie for.</p>
<p>Compared to Luoyang, Zhou Wen actually wished to stay in Guide City. After all, this was his hometown.</p>
<p>It’s indeed impossible to defend Guide City now. Is there a way to first settle down inside a dimensional zone? Zhou Wen kept thinking.</p>
<p>However, the nearby dimensional zones didn’t have suitable locations. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to occupy a dimensional zone, he couldn’t find a suitable place.</p>
<p>Originally, Guide Ancient City was most suitable, but there was an extremely terrifying existence inside. Even Zhou Wen would die if he entered, much less ordinary people.</p>
<p>He didn’t stay any longer and headed for school since the situation had stabilized.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately recognized by the students and people who had come to seek refuge after he entered the school. However, they didn’t dare surround him. They only whispered from afar and secretly discussed him.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no threat here, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Golden Battle God that was guarding the area. Just as he was about to seek out Yu Qiubai, he saw him walk over.</p>
<p>“It’s quieter over at my side. Let’s have a seat over there,” Yu Qiubai said consolingly as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Back then, the school’s management had persuaded him not to interfere with Zhou Wen’s matters to prevent him from offending Overseer An. Despite the immense pressure, he had still helped Zhou Wen get into Sunset College.</p>
<p>No one expected that the student back then would now stand at the top of the human pyramid and would even save the school from destruction.</p>
<p>Even Yu Qiubai himself sometimes wondered if this was a dream-it was simply too beautiful.</p>
<p>“Sir, have some tea.” Zhou Wen served the brewed tea to Yu Qiubai before interrupting his thoughts.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to your timely return. Otherwise, none of these students would have survived,” Yu Qiubai said as he held the teacup.</p>
<p>“This is what I, as a student, should do.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “Sir, Luoyang plans on moving all the people from Guide City to Luoyang. What are your thoughts on this?”</p>
<p>“Guide City has plenty of dimensional zones. However, no one can hold down these dimensional zones at present. However, with humanity’s overall strength increasing, it will definitely be a treasure land in the future. It’s best if we occupy it sooner rather than later,” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>“Sir, I share your thoughts, but I’m just one person. I don’t have people under me, so I’m afraid we won’t be able to have a foothold,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to occupy the entire Guide City now even if there are people and food. Furthermore, those dimensional zones are changing. It’s hard to tell what will happen in the future. If we want to seek quick success, I’m afraid it will end in failure.” Yu Qiubai added after some thought, “If you really wish to stay in Guide City, I have a suggestion. You can first occupy a dimensional zone and gain a foothold before slowly developing it.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I had in mind too, but I wonder which dimensional zone is more suitable. Do you have any suggestions?” Zhou Wen really wanted to stay in Guide City.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, just the humanoid monster and stone saber in Guide Ancient City was worth Zhou Wen staying behind.</p>
<p>“I do have an idea.” Yu Qiubai got up and took out a map of Guide City from a bookshelf. Then, he spread it out on the table and pointed at a location. “If you can take down this dimensional zone, it will be a boon for both offense and defense in the future. Even if a powerful enemy attacks, you can use the dimensional zones’ powers to fend them off…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction Yu Qiubai had pointed, and saw that the name was “Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.”</p>
<p>“Sovereign Sui’s Tomb?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai in surprise.</p>
<p>Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was Suirenshi’s mausoleum. It was very close to the ancient city and was almost right beside Fire God Platform. Later on, after the dimensional zones transformed, Fire God Platform ended up connected to Ancient City. However, the Sovereign Sui’s Tomb wasn’t connected to Ancient City, forming an independent dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Although Sovereign Sui had brought fire to humanity, Fire God Platform wasn’t his territory. Fire God Platform was actually the earliest star observatory in the East District. It belonged to E Bo.</p>
<p>The reason Zhou Wen was surprised was that ever since the dimensional storms, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had become extremely mysterious. It was said that one couldn’t even enter, so how could one build a base there?</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.” Seeing Zhou Wen’s puzzled look, Yu Qiubai laughed heartily. “Over the years in Guide City, I haven’t done much, but I’ve studied Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Although I don’t know it like the back of my hand, I do know it well. If you have any ideas, I can take you in to take a look.”</p>
<p>“Sir, do you have a way of entering? That’s great.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was beside Ancient City and was considered the center of Guide City. With this as a base, it would be convenient for him to develop his surroundings in the future.</p>
<p>Being close to Ancient City was what Zhou Wen wanted the most.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll take you there.” Yu Qiubai stood up with a smile. “Sir, sorry for troubling you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly got up. “I don’t wish to leave after living here for so many years either. It’s naturally best if I can stay,” Yu Qiubai said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Yu Qiubai to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Along the way, he encountered some sporadic skeleton creatures that he easily killed.</p>
<p>Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was perennially enveloped by clouds. It was impossible to fly in directly. Those who did never came out.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had spatial powers, he didn’t dare use instant transmission.</p>
<p>Strangely, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb didn’t have a door. It was said that there was a door in the past. After it became a dimensional zone, the door vanished. All that could be seen was a long wall.</p>
<p>Even if one circled Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, they wouldn’t find any entrance.</p>
<p>“Sir, how do we enter?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai said with a smile, “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed Yu Qiubai forward, but Yu Qiubai didn’t approach Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Instead, he arrived in front of a very short stone temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that it was an Earth temple, but when he got closer, he realized that it wasn’t earth, but a tiny strange beast.</p>
<p>The tiny beast was carved from stone. The workmanship was very crude, and it had been weathered by the ravages of time.</p>
<p>It looked like a fox squatting there.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1472'>Chapter 1472 Sovereign Sui’s Tomb Transformation</h3>
<p>Yu Qiubai took out incense sticks he had prepared and lit three of them. He then handed the remaining three sticks to Zhou Wen and said, “Offer the incense with three bows and you’ll be teleported into the tomb.”</p>
<p>“Offer incense with three bows?” Zhou Wen took the incense sticks as his expression turned odd.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of this and was willing to offer incense, but based on his past experience, nothing good would come from him offering incense.</p>
<p>Only those who offer incense can enter. If I blow up the stone statue, will I be able to enter? Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped Yu Qiubai when he saw that he was about to offer incense.</p>
<p>“Sir, it’s best you let me go first.” Zhou Wen was afraid that Yu Qiubai would be trapped inside if he blew up the stone statue.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Although he didn’t know why Zhou Wen wanted to bow first, Yu Qiubai stepped aside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lit the incense sticks before walking towards the stone temple. He held the incense sticks with both hands and was about to bow to the stone statue.</p>
<p>He heard a boom just as he bent his waist slightly. The stone statue had shifted several feet to the side, revealing a stone staircase that led down.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Yu Qiubai had entered Sovereign Sui’s Tomb quite a number of times, but he had never encountered such a situation. He had no idea that there was a passageway behind the stone statue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t continue bowing as he turned to ask Yu Qiubai, “Sir, is this the path to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb?”</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea. When I previously entered Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, I would enter the tomb like I was riding on clouds as long as I offered incense. I’ve never seen this stone staircase,” Yu Qiubai said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go in and take a look. Sir, wait for me outside,” Zhou Wen said as he walked into the stone temple and walked down the stone steps.</p>
<p>The stone steps weren’t wide, allowing only one person to walk through. Furthermore, the tunnel’s height was too short, so Zhou Wen had to bend his body to walk through. Thankfully, he didn’t discover anything dangerous. When he reached the end of the stone steps, he discovered a pool.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen scanned it and knew that the pool was connected to the outside. After diving into the water, he quickly crawled out of a fountain.</p>
<p>This is Sovereign Sui’s Tomb? Zhou Wen sized up his surroundings and discovered many strange statues. The statues were split into two rows that lined the sides of the stone path. Their shapes were extremely strange, making it impossible to tell what creatures they were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the end of the stone path and saw a huge stone statue. It was a statue of a man holding a torch.</p>
<p>Is that Sovereign Sui’s statue? Zhou Wen realized that although Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was huge, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature inside.</p>
<p>The stone statues didn’t seem like anything else. Even if Zhou Wen reached out to touch them, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai walked in and looked around as he said, “How’s this place? Only by passing through the small temple can one enter. It’s very difficult for outsiders to enter, and there aren’t any dimensional creatures inside. The dimensional creatures outside can’t enter either, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem to use it as a residential area.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if there will be any changes in the future,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the stone statues and Sovereign Sui’s statue.</p>
<p>“Suirenshi is a sovereign of humanity. Even if something happens, it shouldn’t be too dangerous, right?” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Zhou Wen would have shared the same thoughts as Yu Qiubai, but ever since he met the humanoid monster in the ancient city, he no longer had such thoughts.</p>
<p>Suirenshi was indeed a sovereign of humanity, but it was hard to say if he would harm humans after his demonization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Sovereign Sui’s Tomb looked safe, there was actually a hidden danger. Zhou Wen had already scanned the entire cemetery several times, but he didn’t even find any bugs.</p>
<p>How strange. It’s such a huge cemetery that’s big enough to build a city, but there aren’t any dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen felt that this place wasn’t as safe as it looked.</p>
<p>“After I discovered a way to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, I studied it many times, but failed to find any dimensional creatures. Furthermore, dimensional creatures from other dimensional zones seldom approach Sovereign Sui’s Tomb,” Yu Qiubai explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also noticed this. They had encountered quite a number of skeleton creatures on their trip here, but they didn’t see a single one near Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. “Let’s talk outside.” Without discovering any problems, Zhou Wen left Sovereign Sui’s Tomb with Yu Qiubai. He planned on searching the vicinity to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>After leaving via the stone passageway, he arrived in front of the stone temple again. Zhou Wen scanned the stone temple several times, but he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>He circled the outer wall of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to no avail. He couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Could this Sovereign Sui’s Tomb really be a cemetery used to commemorate ancient sages? Although Zhou Wen felt that it couldn’t be that simple, he really couldn’t tell what was wrong.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what do you think?” Yu Qiubai asked.</p>
<p>“It does look very suitable for human habitation. The space is large enough and the entrance is hidden. Dimensional creatures don’t seem to approach this place. It’s very safe,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“If you plan on building a human city here, I believe many people will be willing to stay,” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>“Let me think it through again.” After Zhou Wen sent Yu Qiubai back, he returned to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb alone. He set up a lounge chair and a table under the statue. As he rested, he observed the situation inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also released Chick. He originally brought it here hoping that it could help, but he didn’t manage to use it in the beginning. Later on, the humanoid monster was too powerful, so Zhou Wen didn’t dare release it.</p>
<p>Chick was standing on the table, pecking at the nuts Zhou Wen had placed on the plate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for more than ten hours without discovering any problems when Chick suddenly flapped its wings and flew up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Chick wanted to get some exercise, but to his surprise, Chick flew towards Sovereign Sui’s and landed on the torch held by it.</p>
<p>Chick spat out a ball of phoenix flames. When the phoenix flames touched the torch, the torch that was originally made of stone started burning “Chick, what are you doing?” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly realized that the entire cemetery seemed to undergo a strange change due to the burning of the torch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned his Companion Beast in alarm and prepared for combat.</p>
<p>However, no dimensional creature appeared in the cemetery even after a while. Instead, the weeds and trees in the cemetery seemed to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1473'>Chapter 1473 Zhou Wen’s Decision</h3>
<p>In a corner of the cemetery, there was a wild pear tree. It hadn’t been long since the fruiting season, but now, it was beginning to bloom again. Furthermore, it didn’t take long before fruits began to fall.</p>
<p>The various vegetation in the cemetery grew crazily. The originally short weeds had grown to the height of a person. The entire cemetery was covered in green.</p>
<p>Not long after, pears grew on the wild pear tree. It took only slightly more than half an hour. At the speed the pears grew, they would completely ripen in less than an hour.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for a while and indeed, he saw the pear ripen. It looked plump and juicy. He reached out and plucked one and took a bite. Immediately, his mouth was filled with sweetness as though he had drunk honey.</p>
<p>It’s so sweet! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>He was delighted that the Sovereign Sui statue had such might, allowing vegetation to grow rapidly. If they could occupy this place, they wouldn’t have to worry about food in the future. They would be self-sufficient and no one could besiege the people in here. It was the best place to build a base.</p>
<p>What was surprising was that this power wasn’t only effective against plants. If humans were also affected by this power, then what humans welcomed wasn’t rapid growth, but rapid aging.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how many times a pear tree bore fruit a year. Even if it happened twice a year, it was very likely that half a year had passed in less than an hour.</p>
<p>If humans experienced time with similar ratios, how long could they last?</p>
<p>This was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps the power of Sovereign Sui’s statue didn’t make animals age, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature or animal in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. This didn’t seem to be a coincidence. According to these points of suspicion, the power of Sovereign Sui’s statue might very well have an effect on animals. Therefore, no dimensional creature dared to stay in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Or rather, those dimensional creatures had already died due to the influence of the statue.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that this power wasn’t as simple as a temporal power. If time was accelerated, Zhou Wen would definitely be able to sense it. However, other than sensing the blazing vitality emitted by the torch, he couldn’t sense any negative energy.</p>
<p>After being affected by the power of blessings, Zhou Wen knew that the most terrifying power in the world wasn’t necessarily the ferocious and vicious ones.</p>
<p>Instead, some seemingly beneficial powers were likely terrifying murderers hidden in the shadows.</p>
<p>“Chick, put out the fire,” Zhou Wen shouted at Chick who had landed on the top of Sovereign Sui’s statue. He didn’t dare take the risk. If the accelerating power was equally effective on him, wouldn’t he quickly become an old man?</p>
<p>When Chick heard Zhou Wen, it opened its mouth and sucked at the flames. The flames on the torch immediately transformed into a thin pillar that charged into Chick’s mouth like a fountain.</p>
<p>Moments later, all the flames were devoured by Chick. The torch in the hand of the Sovereign Sui statue stopped burning, and the plants in the cemetery stopped growing crazily. Zhou Wen waited for a while and was pleasantly surprised when he saw that nothing abnormal had happened to the plants. They just stopped growing rapidly. Such accelerated ripening would usually result in a rapid decline after losing the energy supply.</p>
<p>The plants didn’t show any signs of withering. This meant that they hadn’t been excessively drained of their vitality, and was undoubtedly good news.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, grabbed some wild animals, and sent them inside before getting Chick to light the torch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. He left with Chick and planned on returning in a few days to take a look. If the animals died of old age, it would mean that Sovereign Sui’s Tomb wasn’t suitable as a human base.</p>
<p>Of course, even if it couldn’t be used as a human base, the power of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was still very useful. Zhou Wen already planned on staying in Guide City. Regardless, he had to have Sovereign Sui’s Tomb under his control.</p>
<p>After returning to the Sunset Army’s temporary command post and meeting An Sheng, Zhou Wen told him about his wish to stay in Guide City.</p>
<p>“Young Master, with your strength, it’s not a problem for you to stay anywhere. However, have you ever thought that if you were the only one, what’s the difference between staying or not? You are just one person, so even if you stay here, Guide City doesn’t belong to you,” An Sheng said. Zhou Wen understood what An Sheng meant. If no one else worked for him and defended the plundering of the resources from the area, it didn’t matter if he stayed or not. Even if he didn’t stay, he could come over anytime he needed in the future. There was no point in staying here. “I want to establish a human city here.” Zhou Wen had already thought it through. There was the stone saber here that even The Thearch coveted. There was the humanoid monster, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, Butterfly Valley, and other dimensional zones. He didn’t know how many dimensional zones had yet to be explored.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly most suitable to establish a human city here.</p>
<p>It might be a little difficult in the beginning, but the value would increase with time. If it were only Zhou Wen himself, he had no intention of establishing a human city that belonged to him. However, the three conditions mentioned by the humanoid monster weren’t something he could complete alone. This required the efforts of many humans.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only had the thought of establishing a city after leaving Ancient City.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult to build houses, but to truly make those houses a city needs people. With Guide City’s present dire environment, how many people will be willing to stay here?” An Sheng persuaded.</p>
<p>“I know it’ll be very difficult, but I still want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, An Sheng smiled and said, “Young Master, since you’ve already decided, I won’t say another word. Just tell me what resources you need and how many people you need. I’ll do my best to help you obtain them.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Ah Sheng. However, I wish to do it by myself to the greatest extent.” Although Zhou Wen was very grateful, he still rejected An Sheng “Alright, but you have to remember that we are family. No matter where you are, the people from Overseer Manor and I are always worth relying on. Don’t shoulder burdens alone,” An Sheng said seriously.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. If I can’t do it, I’ll definitely head to Luoyang to freeload. If there’s really a need, I won’t stand on ceremony with you and Sis Lan,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>An Sheng laughed out loud. “Young Master Wen, how long are you going to keep up your spite with Overseer?”</p>
<p>“You have to ask An Tianzuo that. I’m very easygoing. I never get into trouble with anyone, nor have I ever taken that particular person to heart,” Zhou Wen said seriously.</p>
<p>An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen without a word, but his eyes seemed to have a hint of contempt, making Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1474'>Chapter 1474 Reality</h3>
<p>“Preposterous!” An Tianzuo slammed his palm on the desk, nearly smashing it to pieces. It was obvious that he was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad thing for Young Master Wen to stay in Guide City. It has plenty of dimensional zones and resources. It will definitely be an important place for all parties to vie for in the future. If Young Master Wen can successfully gain a foothold there, the benefits he will receive in the future will be hundreds of times greater,” An Sheng explained on the phone. “Who doesn’t know that Guide City will definitely become one of the most important places in the world in the future? But look at the six families. Who dares to occupy it? Without the corresponding strength, entering too early will only make them cannon fodder for the other factions,” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen isn’t an ordinary person. His strength isn’t something the six families can compare with. Perhaps he can gain control of Guide City ahead of time.” An Sheng continued speaking up for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong a person is, he’s only one person. What’s the point of him staying there alone?” An Tianzuo thought nothing of An Sheng’s words. “Yu Qiubai has the intention of staying in Guide City. He’s lobbying the other teachers and locals to stay behind. If it really succeeds, it will be a good starting point. There will be a chance for development in the future.” An Sheng reported the situation in Guide City to An Tianzuo in detail.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo snorted coldly. “You don’t need to wait for the outcome to know that it’s impossible. 99% of people won’t choose to stay in Guide City.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said it with certainty, sounding very confident.</p>
<p>An Sheng naturally knew that the success rate of this matter was very low. It was useless even with Zhou Wen’s reputation. Most people would still choose to move to Luoyang. It wasn’t that people didn’t have confidence in Zhou Wen’s strength, but everyone knew very well that no matter how strong Zhou Wen was, it was impossible for him to stay in the city 24/7 to protect them.</p>
<p>The average person needed a stable and orderly society. This was something Zhou Wen couldn’t provide to them now, but Luoyang had everything Even if An Tianzuo wasn’t in Luoyang, Luoyang still had the strength to withstand a large-scale attack from the dimensional creatures. There was a comprehensive city defense system, the famous Sunset Army of the Federation, and many famous experts in the Federation.</p>
<p>Luoyang was basically safe as long as the Sunset Army didn’t fall.</p>
<p>Humans were selfish. No one was willing to bet their lives, so An Tianzuo and An Sheng knew very well that most people wouldn’t stay in Guide City.</p>
<p>The reality was as they imagined. Things didn’t go well when Yu Qiubai went to discuss with the teachers. Although most of the teachers respected him, they still tactfully rejected him.</p>
<p>Even the school management who had a good relationship with Yu Qiubai privately persuaded him not to risk his life and said that he should join everyone in Luoyang for future development.</p>
<p>If even the teachers acted this way, it was even more impossible for the people from Guide City who didn’t have a good relationship with Yu Qiubai to stay.</p>
<p>Most people had already registered with the Sunset Army and were waiting to migrate to Luoyang. Yu Qiubai was very anxious, but there was nothing he could do. The situation in Guide City was indeed wanting. Furthermore, they had yet to confirm if they could build a human city in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, so they were unable to use it as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p>This was within Zhou Wen’s expectations, but he never expected the results to be so tragic. Up to now, there were only a handful of people who were willing to stay. Humans are indeed pragmatic. Zhou Wen originally imagined that with Yu Qiubai’s reputation, he would be able to retain a few hundred people. He never expected there to be so few.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart. Although he really needed people, it wasn’t unacceptable if there weren’t any. As long as he could establish the city, he still had a chance of attracting other humans to join in the future.</p>
<p>However, if there was no one in the early stages, it would indeed be more difficult, making many things inconvenient. No matter how strong Zhou Wen was, he wasn’t omnipotent. Some things needed professionals, and those professionals were what Zhou Wen wanted the most.</p>
<p>For example, for the construction of buildings, Zhou Wen could build a wooden hut or stone building, but the dense buildings with well-planned layouts weren’t something Zhou Wen could do.</p>
<p>An Sheng already knew the outcome of this matter from the applications the Sunset Army received, but he had no solution.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just An Sheng. The various factions in Guide City had long known about this matter. “Zhou Wen sure has wild ideas to dare think of establishing a human city in Guide City.” Xia Liuchuan couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the news.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue pondered for a moment before saying, “I wonder if this is An Tianzuo’s idea. If it’s his idea, he has really taken a terrible step. Guide City is great, and the surroundings are like a breeding ground for myths and legends. Although there aren’t any clear pantheons, what’s available to them is in no way inferior to Jerusalem in terms of dimensional zone resources. They are even more terrifying in certain aspects. However, the overall strength of humanity isn’t enough to establish a human city in such a place. If we were to interfere too early, we would only become the target of public criticism. The An family has already done their best to defend Luoyang. If they still wish to interfere with Guide City, they will probably suffer a double loss.”</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan said, “With my understanding of An Tianzuo, he definitely wouldn’t do such a thing. Furthermore, Zhou Wen comes from Guide City. This matter is probably his idea.” “Although Zhou Wen is strong, establishing a city isn’t something a single person can do. I wonder what he plans on doing.” Xia Xuanyue sighed. Xia Liuchuan suddenly stopped smiling and said to Xia Xuanyue, “Zhou Wen must be lacking manpower now. Are you interested in having a vacation over there?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Xia Xuanyue knew that it wasn’t as simple as sending her on a vacation.</p>
<p>“No one wants Guide City now, but people will be vying for it in the future. If that kid, Zhou Wen, really occupies it, we might be able to reap immense benefits by helping him when he’s most in need. It doesn’t cost us much after all. Just treat it as an investment,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay a visit then.” Xia Xuanyue thought for a moment and nodded.</p>
<p>An Sheng was thinking of a way to help Zhou Wen retain some people. Otherwise, it would be too difficult for him. However, no matter how much he racked his brains, there was no good solution.</p>
<p>It was not like he could force the unwilling to stay at gunpoint.</p>
<p>“You’re so mean… You’re so mean… You’re so mean…” An Sheng heard a ringtone and knew that it was from An Tianzuo. He hurriedly answered the call.</p>
<p>“Overseer, what are your orders?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo’s voice didn’t have any emotion as he said indifferently, “Recently, an unknown break-out creature appeared around Luoyang. We are suffering from a shortage of manpower. Quickly return with the troops to provide support.”</p>
<p>“All of them?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to leave some of them there?” An Tianzuo grunted coldly.</p>
<p>“Then what about Guide City? There are still many people who haven’t registered. Furthermore, it’s impossible to take all of them away at once. Even if we split them into batches, it will probably require dozens of batches for the evacuation…” An Sheng felt that there was a problem.</p>
<p>They couldn’t take so many people with them. Those who couldn’t leave would probably find it difficult to survive. After all, there were still skeleton creatures constantly charging out of Ancient City.</p>
<p>Now, it was all thanks to their suppression that such a situation could be maintained.</p>
<p>“At this point in time, are those people or Luoyang’s safety more important?” An Tianzuo said angrily.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to understand something as he carefully asked, “Overseer, are you implying?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious enough? Don’t bring any of them. Return as quickly as possible. If anything happens to Luoyang, I’ll behead you,” An Tianzuo said coldly.</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll send the troops back now. I won’t take anyone with me and leave them in Guide City.” An Sheng’s expression was odd as he thought to himself, Overseer is really ruthless! There’s still much to learn.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1475'>Chapter 1475 Sovereign Sui’s Statue</h3>
<p>“Zhou Wen… Not good…” Yu Qiubai anxiously sought out Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai in puzzlement, unsure what had happened to make him so nervous.</p>
<p>“A large-scale break-out has happened in Luoyang. An Sheng has returned to Luoyang with his troops to provide reinforcements. The troops have already left Guide City…” Yu Qiubai said worriedly.</p>
<p>“How many people did An Sheng and company take with them?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. “As they left in a hurry, they didn’t take anyone with them. After the skeleton creatures lost their suppression, they charged out en masse. With our present strength, it’s very difficult to stop all the skeletons from rushing out…” Yu Qiubai explained the situation clearly.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he knew what had happened. The so-called situation of break-out creatures in Luoyang wreaking havoc everywhere was just an excuse. An Sheng had long made up his mind to keep them behind.</p>
<p>“Sir, lead your men to the school’s main entrance and set up a signboard. If anyone wishes to enter the school and receive our protection, get them to sign this contract.” Zhou Wen handed a document to Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai unfolded the document and carefully read the content. Then, his expression gradually turned odd.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a little inhuman?” Yu Qiubai said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Since they had already chosen to leave, they naturally have to pay a price if they wish to stay. Otherwise, they will think that we are a place that only takes in the rejected in the future, a place they can come and go as they wish. Then how can rules be implemented?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only use the school as his base as a front to recruit people. He could then establish his city when he found a suitable place. Zhou Wen’s idea was good, but there were too few people under him who could carry out his vision. There were too many people who came to seek refuge under him. Many of them entered secretly. They did not take the initiative to sign a contract with Zhou Wen, believing that they could bluff their way through. Zhou Wen also knew that many people had sneaked in. It could even be said that less than a tenth of the people had signed a contract. Most of them had sneaked in without signing a contract.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart. All he did was tell Yu Qiubai to give more classes and tell them the consequences of not signing a contract.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got his Companion Beasts to guard the area near the school. Humans from the nearby area kept coming to seek refuge.</p>
<p>Most people had no choice but to join Zhou Wen. It was impossible to travel the distance between Guide and Luoyang without sufficient strength. All they could do was join him. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about such matters. When he arrived at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb again, it had been about four days since he had left the animals inside.</p>
<p>In theory, if the power of the torch could really affect them, they should be close to death. Or rather, they should be dead.</p>
<p>Don’t die… Please don’t die… Zhou Wen prayed silently as he walked into Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.</p>
<p>If those tiny animals died due to the influence of the torch’s power, it would be impossible for them to build a human city here. Zhou Wen would have no choice but to find other suitable dimensional zones which might not exist.</p>
<p>After entering Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, the scene Zhou Wen saw left him stunned.</p>
<p>Not only had the animals not died, but they were also shockingly healthy and energetic. What was even more terrifying was that there were many babies in the grass.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. From the looks of it, the power of Sovereign Sui’s torch wasn’t Time Acceleration, nor would it kill animals.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the vitality emitted by the torch made animals stronger and healthier.</p>
<p>I’ll experiment a few more times. If there aren’t any accidents, I should be able to begin building the city. Zhou Wen watched as Chick sucked away the flames on the torch. He clearly saw that the feathers on Chick’s body seemed to glow brighter. Not daring to be careless, Zhou Wen carried out a few more tests. The results showed that the power in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had a very potent effect on plants and animals, but it didn’t age them.</p>
<p>This is somewhat similar to my Human Sovereign power. Zhou Wen suspected that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was likely created by Sovereign Sui. And his original intention was similar to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra that Zhou Wen had comprehended. However, because no human could take this path, he took another.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the opportunity to study Sovereign Sui’s statue. Typical flames couldn’t ignite a torch. The torch looked like it was carved from stone and didn’t have any fuel. Typical flames naturally couldn’t make the stone burn.</p>
<p>When Chick’s phoenix flames touched the torch, it would immediately ignite. However, no matter how long it burned, it wouldn’t damage the torch carved from stone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chick was very interested in the phoenix flames that burned on the torch. Every time Zhou Wen made it absorb the flames, Chick would appear thrilled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used a few fire abilities, but he failed to ignite the torch. Unwilling to give up, he switched to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and the sun-like Human Sovereign appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The moment Human Sovereign appeared, Zhou Wen immediately discovered something strange.</p>
<p>The originally motionless Sovereign Sui statue began to emit vitality.</p>
<p>Previously, when Chick used its phoenix flames to ignite the torch, it only emitted vitality and flames. The Sovereign Sui statue’s main body didn’t undergo an anomaly.</p>
<p>However, the Sovereign Sui statue’s body now began emitting vitality. Although it wasn’t as intense as before, it delighted Zhou Wen. With a thought, Human Sovereign reached out and pressed down on the flaming torch in the statue’s hand.</p>
<p>The torch that ordinary flames couldn’t ignite immediately ignited upon contact with Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the torch. The entire Sovereign Sui statue burned as though gasoline had been poured over it.</p>
<p>The flames and vitality over Sovereign Sui’s body transmitted to Human Sovereign at the same time, making the originally dazzling Human Sovereign even more dazzling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra in his body was circulating crazily as the surrounding vitality constantly surged into his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A deafening boom suddenly entered Zhou Wen’s ears as the burning Sovereign Sui statue moved.</p>
<p>The statue that was clearly made of stone slowly raised its leg and stood up from its stone throne. The flames of vitality on its body intensified, making it difficult to see its body clearly.</p>
<p>In particular, the pair of eyes stared at Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign like two two-million-watt searchlights.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1476'>Chapter 1476 Extinguishing Hope</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed as he instantly transmitted to dodge the flames from Sovereign Sui’s statue, but the flames were too fast, giving him no room to dodge. Before he could activate instant transmission, the flames had already shone on him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom drank, nor did he have any experience of getting drunk. However, when the flames shone on him, he felt intoxicated.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>All of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb began spewing flames. The flames here were very strange. Although they were hot, they didn’t injure anyone.</p>
<p>Infinite flames condensed towards Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra in Zhou Wen’s body seemed to circulate uncontrollably.</p>
<p>As the flames surged into him, Zhou Wen felt the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and Human Sovereign crazily absorb the flames from Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he felt Human Sovereign’s transformation.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra had already reached the Terror grade. If it could improve further, it would definitely be the Calamity grade. Human Sovereign’s sun-like body had already turned into a blob of magma after absorbing a large amount of flames. His body was no longer limited to just being a projection; instead, it became more and more corporeal.</p>
<p>As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra circulated and absorbed large amounts of flames, Zhou Wen vaguely understood something.</p>
<p>Previously, the humanoid monster had demonstrated the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra. However, his Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s path was different from the Ancient Sovereign Sutra Zhou Wen had comprehended, so it wasn’t worth much as a reference.</p>
<p>The power of fire in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had a similar attribute to Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but it wasn’t completely the same. It had its own unique traits.</p>
<p>Due to the similar attributes, Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was perfectly compatible with these flames. It was very easy for him to resonate with it.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen vaguely understood that to use the dimensional zones’ powers to raise his Essence Energy Art didn’t require any special methods. All he needed to do was find a dimensional zone that was compatible with his Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that finding such a dimensional zone was considered a success. Just like how Essence Energy Arts varied in strength, dimensional zones were the same.</p>
<p>There were countless fire-elemental dimensional zones in the four districts of the Federation, but not every dimensional zone could help a Terror-grade creature advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>There was another key point. Zhou Wen didn’t know what to call an existence like the Human Sovereign statue, but only by finding it and using an Essence Energy Art to resonate with it could he use the dimensional zones’ powers to advance to the Calamity grade. Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was filled with flames that resembled bonfires that had flames surging into the sky. From the outside of the cemetery, it looked like a huge grave made of flames.</p>
<p>However, inside Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, the plants that had rapidly grown due to the influence of Sovereign Sui’s flames were also ignited. Soon, they were burned to ashes. They didn’t grow again due to the powerful vitality in the flames.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed all of this and came to a realization. To humans, Sovereign Sui created the way to create fire from rubbing wood. It brought light and fire to humans, but to plants, it’s a destructive blow. Problems should be viewed from different angles-good things might not necessarily be good.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s comprehension, the flames in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb spewed out more and more violently as they surged towards Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai was filled with zeal. When he previously tried to persuade people to stay, they had ignored him and even rejected him. Those were the better ones. Those whose moral standards were lacking nearly cursed Yu Qiubai in the face.</p>
<p>Yet, in just a few days, the people who had been berating him cried and begged to stay. The changes were so fast that Yu Qiubai found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>This also gave Yu Qiubai hope. With Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, so many people, and with Zhou Wen presiding over it, Guide City might be rebuilt.</p>
<p>As there were too many people, the school couldn’t accommodate them anymore. Even the school’s vicinity was filled with people. The weather wasn’t too cold now, so they could stay outside for the time being.</p>
<p>Even if the skeleton legion didn’t mount an attack, it would be difficult for them to survive once the weather worsened.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with so many people, food, lodging, and transportation were problems. They had to quickly resolve the problem of the base. With a base, everyone could take up their own responsibilities to ensure order.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai was thankfully the principal of the school. He had previously been in charge of managing the school’s various operations. The teachers and school management immediately came back under Yu Qiubai’s management.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai could temporarily maintain order with their help.</p>
<p>After making the arrangements, Yu Qiubai went to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to look for Zhou Wen. He wanted to discuss with him if he could get a group of people to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to carry out the early construction work.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai arrived at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Before he could head to the stone temple, he saw the flaming tomb.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Could something have happened in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb? Yu Qiubai was alarmed because Zhou Wen was still inside. If something had happened to him, everyone in Guide City would be doomed.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai turned around and ran towards the stone temple, hoping to rush in to see what had happened. If Zhou Wen needed help, he might be able to do something.</p>
<p>However, before Yu Qiubai could rush to the stone temple, he heard a loud boom coming from Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Turning his head, he saw rows of collapsed walls.</p>
<p>The flames in the wall had already vanished. In the past, when he looked at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb from the outside, he could only see the walls and fog. Now, he could take in everything inside with a glance.</p>
<p>The scene inside left Yu Qiubai stunned.</p>
<p>The cemetery that was originally filled with all sorts of weeds and vegetation had now turned into scorched earth. There was no sign of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the various stone sculptures in the cemetery had already been charred black. Even the Sovereign Sui statue had vanished, leaving behind a pile of rubble. Only Zhou Wen was standing in the cemetery unharmed.</p>
<p>It’s over! Yu Qiubai was delighted when he saw that Zhou Wen was fine, but when he saw Sovereign Sui’s Tomb present state, his face turned ashen.</p>
<p>They originally wanted to establish a human city in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, but now that it was in such a state, they naturally couldn’t count on it.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if he could find another suitable dimensional zone. Even if he could find one in the future, with so many people waiting outside the school and constantly being harassed by the skeleton legion, who knew how many people could last until then.</p>
<p>Helpless, Yu Qiubai was just about to head over to take a look at Zhou Wen when he suddenly saw him emit a sun-like brilliance.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1477'>Chapter 1477 Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens</h3>
<p>Although Zhou Wen knew that the birth of every Calamity-grade creature would be accompanied by the descent of a Calamity, he never expected that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s advancement to the Calamity grade would destroy the Sovereign Sui Tomb dimensional zone.</p>
<p>At the instant the Ancient Sovereign Sutra advanced to the Calamity grade, Human Sovereign automatically fused with Zhou Wen, causing his entire body to emit light and heat. It was like a spring sun that brought warmth to the world, but it wasn’t too hot.</p>
<p>Under the illumination from Zhou Wen’s body, tender sprouts crawled out of the ashes of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb that had already turned into a charred ruin.</p>
<p>In just moments, the sprouts grew into different plants. There were weeds that were more than a meter tall and saplings that constantly grew until they soon reached into the sky, blooming with flowers.</p>
<p>The cemetery that had turned into scorched earth now looked like a flora paradise in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai stood outside, staring blankly at the oasis-like existence in front of him. The vegetation inside grew lusher and luxuriant. It was unimaginable that a moment ago, it was still scorched earth.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen… Are you okay…” Finding it all bizarre, Yu Qiubai worried for Zhou Wen. Yu Qiubai had heard some stories in the past. For example, the death of a whale would give many lifeforms in the sea a chance of survival.</p>
<p>There were also similar records in many myths. For example, after Pangu split the heavens and earth, he transformed into all things. Only when a powerhouse died would all things obtain the chance to grow.</p>
<p>Now that everything was growing here, Yu Qiubai was truly afraid that something untoward had happened to Zhou Wen. He rushed into the forest worriedly as he searched for him, constantly calling out his name.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai squeezed through the grass and trees, traversing a few hundred meters before finally arriving at a circular clearing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there, emitting a sun-like brilliance. He looked almost inhuman.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen… Zhou Wen…” Yu Qiubai called out a few times, but when he didn’t receive a response from Zhou Wen, he suddenly felt something amiss.</p>
<p>He was advanced in age. Although he couldn’t be considered ailing, he wasn’t young anymore.</p>
<p>Coupled with the previous battles and recent work, it was normal for him to feel exhausted.</p>
<p>But now, he felt as though his entire body was filled with energy. It was similar to when he woke up in his prime. It was as though he had infinite energy. Even the pain and side effects from the previous battle had unknowingly vanished. It was as though he had healed himself.</p>
<p>Just as Yu Qiubai was feeling alarmed, he saw the light in front of him dim. Zhou Wen had already returned to his original appearance and was looking at him.</p>
<p>“Sir, why are you here?” Zhou Wen was first alarmed when he saw that it was Yu Qiubai. Only when he saw that Yu Qiubai was fine did he relax.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sovereign Sutra had just advanced to the Calamity grade and formed a domain. He didn’t know if the Calamity Zone would harm humans, so he was given a fright when he saw Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>“I came to look for you to discuss if we can send a group of people into Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. From the looks of it, there’s no need for any discussion.” Yu Qiubai asked with a bitter smile, “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. In short, there’s no way to build a human city here. We have to find another place as soon as possible. Teacher Yu, do you have any other suggestions?” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that things would turn out this way. With Sovereign Sui’s Tomb destroyed, he could only find another place.</p>
<p>However, for the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to condense a Calamity Zone, such a price was worth it.</p>
<p>The only thing that displeased Zhou Wen was that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Calamity Zone was still a domain similar to strengthening and healing. It still didn’t seem to have any offensive properties.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen had just condensed the Calamity Zone and had yet to completely figure it out. He still needed time to familiarize himself with it.</p>
<p>He took out his phone and took a look. He realized that when he switched to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, there was indeed an additional Calamity Zone row.</p>
<p>Zone: Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Why does the name of this domain give off an ominous feeling… I have a nickname, Human Sovereign… If Human Sovereign sacrifices to the heavens… Doesn’t that mean I’ll be sacrificed to the heavens… Zhou Wen felt a little awkward when he saw the name of the domain.</p>
<p>The name was given by the game system, so Zhou Wen couldn’t change it even if he wanted to. All he could do was silently accept it. “There are indeed quite a number of dimensional zones near Guide City, but there are many that are very strange. They aren’t suitable for human habitation…” After some thought, Yu Qiubai couldn’t think of a suitable place. “Let’s talk when we’re back.” Zhou Wen was a local, so he naturally knew that Yu Qiubai was right. The dimensional zones near Guide City were indeed very strange.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare enter Ancient City. He hadn’t been able to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb in the past. There were many Essence Crystal ores in Butterfly Valley, but according to the information Zhou Wen knew, Butterfly Valley had a time limit.</p>
<p>It was fine to enter Butterfly Valley at certain times, but there were certain periods when one couldn’t come out. The people who entered would never be found again. There were also some dimensional zones that had their own uniqueness. In short, there weren’t many dimensional zones that were suitable for human habitation.</p>
<p>“Under the present circumstances, we have to find a dimensional zone as soon as possible and give everyone a place to stay. With so many people crowding around the school, it’s only a matter of time before something bad happens… If there’s really no other way… We can only give that place a try…” Yu Qiubai said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Where?” Zhou Wen could tell from Yu Qiubai’s words that there was a dimensional zone suitable for humans.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai appeared to be in a dilemma, but he also knew that he had to think of a solution. Therefore, even if he was somewhat apprehensive, he still said, “In the dimensional zones I previously investigated, there’s one that might be able to accommodate a large number of humans. However, there’s a problem with that dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Since Yu Qiubai had suggested the dimensional zone, it meant that it wasn’t completely unsolvable.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai said, “I’ve previously been to Taiqing Palace and Laojun Platform. Although Taiqing Palace is huge, too many strange things happen inside. It’s not suitable for humans to gather there en masse. On the other hand, Laojun Platform’s dimensional zones are more suitable for humans, but there’s something strange about it…”</p>
<p>The Laojun Platform that Yu Qiubai mentioned was also known as the Immortal Ascension Platform. Legend had it that it was the place where Taishang Laojun ascended to immortality. After the dimensional storms, it also became a dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform wasn’t just an ancient myth. In recent times, there were also some magical legends.</p>
<p>Legend had it that when the Japanese army attacked Luyi County City, which was also the county city where Mount Laojun was located, the county city was filled with short, dilapidated buildings with no tall buildings in sight, the most obvious building in the distance was Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>Before the attack, the Japanese soldiers had first bombarded the county city with artillery. Furthermore, they had targeted the most outstanding spot, Laojun Platform. In the end, after thirteen consecutive blasts, they only heard the sound of shells being fired, but not the sound of explosions.</p>
<p>The Japanese army rushed into the city only to find that the commoners in the city had safely retreated. There was no one in the city. When the Japanese army arrived in front of Laojun Platform, they realized that their target had been Taishang Laojun’s Immortal Ascension Platform.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1478'>Chapter 1478 Laojun Platform</h3>
<p>After the war, Umekawa Taro, the gunner responsible for bombarding Laojun Platform, came to Luyi again and kowtowed in repentance. According to him, he had fired the shells very accurately back then. The shells had hit Laojun Platform, but why hadn’t the shells exploded? Even he couldn’t explain it.</p>
<p>Umekawa Taro believed that Taishang Laojun had blessed the area. He even erected a monument of repentance at Laojun Platform, but it was later changed to a monument of peace.</p>
<p>No one could verify it now.</p>
<p>However, after Laojun Platform became a dimensional zone, it indeed became a magical land.</p>
<p>Typical dimensional zones had dimensional creatures, but there were no dimensional creatures on Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>That wasn’t entirely accurate. There were just no native dimensional creatures. Instead, many dimensional creatures from other dimensional zones had fled to Laojun Platform to seek refuge.</p>
<p>Typical dimensional zones didn’t reject humans, but they had a strong rejection effect on creatures from other dimensional zones. Creatures from different dimensional zones seldom ran around. However, this wasn’t the case with Laojun Platform. Any dimensional creature, including humans, could freely enter and exit Laojun Platform, but there was one point-killing was prohibited.</p>
<p>This was very similar to Mount Laojun. Both places forbade killing. The difference was that if one killed on Laojun Platform, the consequences would be worse than on Mount Laojun.</p>
<p>Legend had it that a group of humans had chased after a rare dimensional creature all the way to Laojun Platform. The group only managed to kill it when the dimensional creature placed one foot on Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>They also knew the taboo of Laojun Platform, so they were somewhat hesitant. However, that dimensional creature was very rare to begin with. Back then, they realized that it seemed to have a Companion Egg in its body. They ultimately failed to resist the temptation and ran to loot the corpse.</p>
<p>A beam ended up descending from the sky and took them all away. No one saw them again. The locals claimed that Laojun had personally taken action to finish them off, sending them to heaven as he couldn’t stand them. It was impossible to determine the veracity of this matter. From then on, no one dared to kill at Laojun Platform. They didn’t even dare to cause injuries.</p>
<p>Of course, dimensional creatures that escaped into Laojun Platform wouldn’t harm humans there either.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform became one of the few dimensional zones that allowed humans to coexist peacefully with dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen had previously heard of it, but Luyi was a county under Guide City. Zhou Wen had never been there, so he had never entered Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>“In that case, Laojun Platform is indeed very suitable for establishing a human city. Is the space there big enough?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Space in Laojun Platform wasn’t too big, but after it became a dimensional zone, it expanded. It shouldn’t be a problem to house a million people.” Yu Qiubai sighed and continued, “However, I’ve already said that there’s still a problem with Laojun Platform. If we don’t resolve this problem, it’s useless even if we build a city there. No one will dare live there.”</p>
<p>“The killing prohibition isn’t the problem you are talking about?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had never heard of any other taboos in Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>“Of course not. That condition is extremely beneficial to humans, so how can it be a problem? If that’s the case, people would have long fled to seek refuge there. However, in fact, no one dares to head to Laojun Platform,” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>“Why’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Because Laojun Platform has been occupied by a dimensional creature that doesn’t abide by its rules. That dimensional creature can kill as it pleases without being punished. Any human who dares enter has been wiped out by it, so no one dares to enter.” Yu Qiubai sighed. “If we wish to build a city here, we have to kill that dimensional creature or chase it out.” “Why don’t I know that? When did that dimensional creature appear? What does it look like?” Zhou Wen was surprised.</p>
<p>At the very least, Laojun Platform was where Taishang Laojun had ascended. Although he didn’t know how true it was, could a place that was related to Taishang Laojun be destroyed by an ordinary dimensional creature? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a deep understanding of how terrifying Mount Laojun was either way. Laojun Platform was somewhat similar to Mount Laojun. Zhou Wen felt that the dimensional creature that could wreak havoc there wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>“I don’t dare to enter. I heard from others that the dimensional creature looks very strange. It looks like a cross between a lion or tiger, but not exactly so. It has scales all over its body like the legendary Qilin. It’s more than three meters tall and moves like the wind. No one can escape its bite.” Yu Qiubai told Zhou Wen all the information he had gathered.</p>
<p>However, the information he gathered was from a few survivors. It likely didn’t differ from the ground truth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought carefully for a while, but he couldn’t figure out the origins of the dimensional creature. He only felt that since a person could see it, its level couldn’t be too high.</p>
<p>Could it be that the abilities of that dimensional creature are similar to my Dao Sutra? It can crack taboo powers, so it can kill as it pleases at Mount Laojun? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to head to Laojun Platform to take a look. Since ordinary people had a chance of escaping, even if he couldn’t beat the opponent, escaping shouldn’t be a problem for him.</p>
<p>The situation was dire. There were still hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City who had nowhere to go. They couldn’t just stay outside the school all night. Things would go wrong once the food and water ran out.</p>
<p>He had to find a place to settle them down as soon as possible and get them to have something to do. At the very least, he had to provide them with their meals. Otherwise, once something went wrong, it would be difficult to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai returned to school after a discussion to stabilize the situation with those people. Those who signed the contract were given priority. He would employ a divide and conquer strategy, by giving carrots to some and using the stick on others. He didn’t want to cause too much of a conflict. Regardless, he had to persist until Zhou Wen found a suitable dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to Laojun Platform alone. Before he left, he handed Chick to Yu Qiubai. Chick would be able to hold the fort if anything really happened as long as no Calamity-grade entity interfered.</p>
<p>The distance between regions increased significantly as Earth’s dimensionalization deepened, but Luyi was very close to begin with, so Zhou Wen didn’t spend much time reaching Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>From afar, Laojun Platform looked like a paradise on earth. There were buildings made of green bricks and tiles amidst the white clouds, making it look like a fairyland.</p>
<p>There were many buildings along the periphery of Laojun Platform that came under the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only see the outline of the buildings outside, but he couldn’t see what was inside.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the entrance of the dimensional zone, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter. He first circled the area, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1479'>Chapter 1479 Mingdao Palace</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen came in front of the memorial archway and saw the words “Door of Perception” engraved on it. After passing through the archway, he entered Mingdao Palace which housed Laojun Platform inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen searched the area outside the archway for a while, but he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. All he could do was pass through it and continue walking in.</p>
<p>The area around the archway wasn’t a dimensional zone. Entry into the dimensional zone started from entering Mingdao Palace.</p>
<p>The door to the Mingdao Palace wasn’t grand. Instead, the two corner towers were more eye-catching</p>
<p>Although the two corner towers weren’t big, they were rather antiquated. The corner tower on the right had a huge bell, and the corner tower on the left had a huge drum.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had heard from others that killing wasn’t allowed in Mingdao Palace. All kinds of creatures could coexist peacefully. Apart from killing, one couldn’t just climb the bell and drum towers, much less strike them. If one didn’t do it properly, they might very well die.</p>
<p>Others said that striking the bell would bring about something good.</p>
<p>In any case, there were all sorts of opinions. Zhou Wen didn’t know which were true and which were fake. He wouldn’t strike them even if he had nothing better to do.</p>
<p>He failed to find the tiny palm symbol after circling the area a few times. This left Zhou Wen depressed, but he thought of something else. It’s useless even if there’s a tiny palm symbol. There aren’t any dimensional creatures in Mingdao Palace to begin with. The dimensional creatures inside are all foreign. Even if I download the dungeon, foreign dimensional creatures won’t appear in the game dungeon. In the end, I have to enter to see how powerful the dimensional creature is. Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t too afraid. The dimensional creature may not abide by the rules of Laojun Platform, but he had the Dao Sutra and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, so he too could also disobey the rules.</p>
<p>Of course, the real reason for Zhou Wen’s confidence was that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had advanced to the Calamity grade. Although his true level was still at the Terror grade, once the Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens Zone was activated, he was no different from a true Calamity.</p>
<p>Together with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and the Soul Mirror, even if that creature was really at the Calamity grade, it was still an unknown who would end up being killed.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to be afraid of. Just do it! Zhou Wen summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor and put it on. At the same time, he used the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and Dao Sutra. He summoned the Soul Mirror and hugged it before walking towards the door of Mingdao Palace.</p>
<p>After passing through the door, he saw a small square. There were pavilions and buildings that extended like a mountain range. He didn’t know how many buildings there were.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen came here, Yu Qiubai had given him a map, but from the looks of it, many of the buildings inside didn’t match the map.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t because Yu Qiubai wanted to harm him or give him a fake map. Instead, it was because the dimensional zone itself was constantly changing. The interior space would expand and new buildings would appear. The layout would naturally change.</p>
<p>No matter how the interior environment changed, the general layout didn’t change much. Laojun Platform was likely at the back of Mingdao Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen swept his gaze and saw many avian dimensional creatures roosting nearby, along with some tiny beasts frolicking on the grass. He couldn’t help but think. Fighting and killing isn’t the goal. The key is to deal with that dimensional creature. A cultured person like me isn’t suitable for fighting and killing. It’s best to use my brain. I heard that that dimensional creature only kills humans and doesn’t harm other dimensional creatures. From the looks of it, it’s true. Now that I’m using the ability of the Demon God Bloodline Catalog to mimic one of the dimensional creatures, I can be at ease and search for its traces. Perhaps I might even have a chance to defeat it with my intelligence.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it made sense. Therefore, he secretly crawled through the grass and engraved the Demon God Bloodline Catalog.</p>
<p>With the help of The Disqualified, the Demon God Body’s ability to simulate transformations was not as inept as before. The Disqualified had a huge augmentation effect on the Demon God Body.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already tried his best to converge his aura and expose the aura of the Demon God Body, the little beasts on the grassland still retreated into the forest warily when they saw him approach. Clearly, they were still very wary of him.</p>
<p>A few of the little beasts looked rather clumsy and ran very slowly. One of them accidentally tripped over a tree root that protruded from the ground. Its fleshy head and furry body fell to the ground. It resembled Garfield.</p>
<p>Of course, the tiny beast wasn’t Garfield. It was probably some kind of feline. It was only about the height of Zhou Wen’s knees, but because it was too fat, its movements were very clumsy. Its face was fat and rotund, and its eyes were big and round. It looked like it was in a daze. It wasn’t as ferocious as felines like tigers, but rather like a panda. Its fur wasn’t black or white though. It was gray, almost blue. I’ll transform into it. Zhou Wen saw that it was the stupidest and ran the slowest, so he used the Demon God Body. As his eyes scanned its body, his body also changed.</p>
<p>In just a moment, two clumsy little beasts appeared on the grass. Be it their appearance or aura, they were identical, like twins.</p>
<p>The little beast that had wanted to escape sniffed the air and looked back. It realized that there was a creature that looked identical to it. It immediately stopped running.</p>
<p>This fellow definitely wasn’t smart. It turned its head and sized up Zhou Wen curiously. It even approached and sniffed him.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen was somewhat impressed with his transformation ability. The little beast sniffed for a while and actually treated Zhou Wen as one of its kind. It even came up and leaned against Zhou Wen as though it wanted hugs.</p>
<p>“Good boy… You are already an adult. Let’s go to a more exciting place to play.” Zhou Wen used it as a cover. As he played with it, he walked to the right of Mingdao Palace. He might encounter the creature if he went straight. Zhou Wen planned on walking down the long corridor on the right. It was best not to alarm the dimensional creature that killed any human he saw.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures along the way were no longer afraid of Zhou Wen in his dimensional creature form. They acted normally as though he didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured the tiny beast all the way to the bell tower. From afar, he could see that the huge bell on the bell tower seemed to be made of raw metal. It was taller than a person and had the words “Mingdao Palace” engraved on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t plan on looking for trouble, so he naturally didn’t head up the bell tower. After walking for a while, he saw a stone pavilion in the forest to the side.</p>
<p>It wasn’t surprising to find a stone pavilion here. In the anomalous Mingdao Palace, there were at least 80 stone pavilions, if not 100. However, there was a behemoth in the stone pavilion. It was staring at him with its blood-red eyes that resembled wheels.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1480'>Chapter 1480 Holy Spring Well</h3>
<p>It can’t be that coincidental, right!? Zhou Wen muttered inwardly.</p>
<p>The behemoth in the stone pavilion looked like a bear no matter how he looked at it. It was a giant bear with grayish-blue fur. Zhou Wen’s present appearance was somewhat similar to it.</p>
<p>This little beast isn’t a cat! It’s a bear? Aren’t you too deceptive looking like that? Zhou Wen sensed that the bear’s aura was extremely terrifying. Before it flew into a rage, its aura surged like a tsunami. Even Zhou Wen was alarmed. It was definitely at the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen had always been reverent towards creatures like bears.</p>
<p>Many people found bears stupid, nothing but fools that were easily bullied. Zhou Wen had thought so too when he was young.</p>
<p>However, in middle school, Yu Qiubai had given a lecture about bear legends. It completely overturned Zhou Wen’s understanding of bears. This made him subconsciously take more care every time he saw bear-type dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>In fact, in the early myths and legends of the East District, bears occupied a very important position.</p>
<p>Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan had a bear lineage. In the legends of Yu the Great’s control of water, Yu the Great had also transformed into a bear and fought all sorts of water beasts. Before the Spring and Autumn War, there were many legends regarding divine bears—they were also the earliest form of totem worship. The rise of dragons only happened in the later generations.</p>
<p>The reason why ancient people worshiped bears so much was not only because of their immense strength and impressive combat prowess, but also because of the bears’ hibernation habits. A bear could avoid food and water for months. When it appeared again, it would give people the feeling that life had returned. Therefore, ancient people worshiped bears very much.</p>
<p>Even the legendary Chaos Beasts were very likely to be created using bears as blueprints in certain versions.</p>
<p>After hearing Yu Qiubai’s lecture, Zhou Wen’s impression of bears changed significantly. Therefore, when he saw a Calamity-grade bear, he subconsciously became cautious and didn’t attack immediately.</p>
<p>The giant bear only stared at him without attacking</p>
<p>The giant bear’s blood-red eyes looked at the tiny beast beside it before looking at Zhou Wen as though it was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. So that’s how it is. It can’t tell who its child is. That’s why it’s so hesitant and hasn’t taken action.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, the giant bear got up and walked out of the stone pavilion. It circled around Zhou Wen and the baby bear a few times before reaching out its claws and throwing Zhou Wen and the baby bear onto its back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was given a fright. Thankfully, his mental fortitude was sufficiently robust. He resisted the urge to attack as he found himself on the bear’s back.</p>
<p>Which bastard said that the Calamity creature here looks something like a lion or tiger, but not like either? It’s a freaking bear! Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he sat on the bear’s back.</p>
<p>With his current position, it was undoubtedly the best opportunity to assassinate the bear. All he needed to do was pull out the Immortal Culling Sword and strike the bear’s neck or other relatively weaker spots. Perhaps he could have Calamity-grade bear meat for his meal today.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but gulp.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen quickly rejected this thought. A Calamity-grade creature doesn’t have negative intelligence, right? Even if it can’t tell who’s its child, doesn’t it know how many children it has?</p>
<p>This clearly didn’t make sense. The bear placed both creatures on its back despite knowing that one creature wasn’t its child. That meant that something had to be wrong. From the looks of it, this bear definitely wants to trick me. There must be a conspiracy. That must be the case. I can’t act rashly. I can’t let it see through me. I’ll figure out its scheme first. Zhou Wen resisted the urge to assassinate the bear.</p>
<p>The bear shook its body from side to side as it slowly walked through the forest.</p>
<p>Its body was huge, but as it moved, its body seemed to turn into a blue phantom. When its body slammed into the trees or other vegetation, it passed right through them.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen and the baby bear were affected by this power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the trees passed through his body as though they were illusory. It left him greatly surprised.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was proficient in spatial powers. He was also proficient in spatial teleportation and spatial traversal. He was very certain that this was not a spatial ability.</p>
<p>How strange. What are the origins of this bear? With its level and ability, there aren’t many creatures on Earth that can fight it. Does it need to hide from its enemies and come to a place like Laojun Platform? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more puzzled he became.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that there was something wrong with the bear’s origins, so he didn’t dare attack haphazardly.</p>
<p>The bear carried Zhou Wen and the baby bear as it slowly walked deeper into Mingdao Palace. Be it the forest or various buildings, nothing could stop the bear from advancing.</p>
<p>It was like a ghost that didn’t exist in the world. It walked through the mortal world without being bound by anything in it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw all sorts of buildings and ancient trees. There were many dimensional creatures lurking around, but they didn’t dare approach the bear. They quickly retreated once they discovered it.</p>
<p>They retreated, but not in fear. Furthermore, after retreating, they looked at the giant bear from afar. It was obvious that they weren’t especially afraid.</p>
<p>Could it be that this fellow wants to take me to Laojun Platform? What motives does it have? How does this benefit it? Could it be that there’s something on Laojun Platform that allows it to determine who its real child is? Just as Zhou Wen was guessing, the bear slowly stopped and didn’t continue walking forward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked around and realized that he hadn’t arrived at Laojun Platform. In front of the giant bear was an ancient well with a water pump and a wooden bucket.</p>
<p>At this point, the bear sprawled down and lifted Zhou Wen and the baby bear down to the side of the well. Then, like a human, it picked up the wooden bucket and placed it in the well. It shook the wooden rack, hoping to draw some water.</p>
<p>What’s this fellow up to? Zhou Wen sized up the surroundings and saw the words “Holy Spring Well” engraved on a rock. He immediately knew where he was.</p>
<p>Holy Spring Well was rather famous. Legend had it that when Laojun was about to ascend, his mount, Azure Bull, who was chained to the side of the well, seemed to know that its master was about to leave. It couldn’t help but moo and cry as tears of blood flowed down its eyes.</p>
<p>Laojun couldn’t bear to part with the Azure Bull either, but the Azure Bull was mortal, so it was impossible for it to ascend with him.</p>
<p>Helpless, Laojun poured a calabash of Golden Cores he had personally refined into the well, causing the ordinary water well to surge.</p>
<p>The Azure Bull drank the Holy Spring Water daily, allowing it to ascend and reunite with its master in the future.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1481'>Chapter 1481 The Baffling Giant Bear</h3>
<p>Holy Spring Well had apparently dried up in the past. After Mingdao Palace transformed into a dimensional zone, Holy Spring Well surged with spring water again. After the spring water appeared, someone had tried drinking the spring water from the Holy Spring Well, but there were no special effects. Not only did he not ascend to immortality, but there weren’t even any healing effects.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering, the bear had already raised the bucket. It was filled with water.</p>
<p>wouldn’t be too clear, but now, the water in the bucket looked purer than pure water. One could even smell the sweetness of the spring water.</p>
<p>Earth’s environment is many times better than before. Speaking of which, can this be considered a form of self-repair for Earth? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think.</p>
<p>The giant bear placed the bucket between Zhou Wen and the bear as the baby bear lowered its head to lick the water.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this, he had no choice but to move his head over. Otherwise, if the giant bear saw through him, all his prior forbearance would have been in vain.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t too interested in killing the bear. With the huge changes in Mingdao Palace, all he wanted to know was if there had been any changes to Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>In the past, Laojun Platform had a total of 33 steps from bottom to top. It meant that Taishang Laojun had ascended to the 33 Heavens. It was unknown what Laojun Platform had become.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen was still looking forward to it before coming</p>
<p>The Dao Sutra he cultivated came from Mount Laojun. This place was called Laojun Platform. Perhaps they had some connection and he could use Laojun Platform to advance the Dao Sutra to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>However, along the way, he didn’t discover anything that could advance the Dao Sutra. At the very least, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder in his body didn’t resonate.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen thought about it, he drank the water. Soon, the bucket was finished by him and the baby bear. Finally, the baby bear hugged the bucket and rolled on the ground, pouring the remaining water into its mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t notice anything special when he drank the water. There wasn’t any rich Essence Energy contained in it, nor did he discover any special attributes. Apart from the refreshing taste, he didn’t discover any benefits from the water.</p>
<p>Seeing that the bucket was empty, the giant bear carried the bucket away and quickly scooped another bucket of water. It placed it between Zhou Wen and the baby bear again. It apparently wanted them to continue drinking. The baby bear obediently drank the water, but Zhou Wen wasn’t too willing. Although he could drink it, he wasn’t an aquatic animal. What was the point of drinking so much water?</p>
<p>Despite his thoughts, he still had to drink. Furthermore, he couldn’t drink less than the baby bear.</p>
<p>If the baby bear drank a lot every day and he only drank a little, it would inevitably arouse the giant bear’s suspicion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected the giant bear to draw bucket after bucket. It had no intention of stopping Once the water in the bucket was finished, the giant bear would immediately draw another bucket of water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen foolishly fought with the bear for more in the beginning. After a few buckets, he couldn’t take it anymore. All he could do was drink as little as possible and let the baby bear drink more.</p>
<p>After ten buckets, Zhou Wen was at his limits. All he did was extend his tongue and lick it a few times. He really couldn’t drink anymore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even willing to fight the bear to the death rather than drink any more water.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the giant bear ignored Zhou Wen’s obvious difference. It only watched from the side and waited for the baby bear to finish drinking before drawing more water.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only heard of people who couldn’t be satiated. This was the first time he was seeing someone like the baby bear who could drink indefinite amounts of water.</p>
<p>The baby bear was like a bottomless pit. It drank more than half of the ten buckets of water, but it still looked like it wasn’t enough. Its stomach didn’t expand either.</p>
<p>Could it be that the water in the Holy Spring Well really has some benefits? But I’ve also drunk quite a bit. Why don’t I feel anything? Logically speaking, there should be some benefits after drinking for so long, right? But if there aren’t any benefits, why is this baby bear so gluttonous? It’s as though it can’t be satiated. Zhou Wen considered drinking more. What if there were benefits?</p>
<p>However, this thought was instantly rejected by him. He really couldn’t drink anymore. He nearly vomited when he saw the water.</p>
<p>Forget it. If the Holy Spring Well’s water really has benefits, I’ll just find an opportunity to extract some and place it in the chaos space. I’ll use Holy Spring Water to eat, cook, and boil soup. I’ll even use Holy Spring Water to wash my clothes… It was just a thought on Zhou Wen’s part. He wouldn’t really bear to use Holy Spring Water to wash his clothes.</p>
<p>What’s that giant bear trying to do? When Zhou Wen saw that the giant bear was constantly drawing water for the baby bear to drink, he had more questions. However, he didn’t know who to ask.</p>
<p>In the end, Zhou Wen stood by the side and watched without even continuing the act.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept counting by the side. The baby bear finally seemed full when it drank more than thirty buckets. It burped before it could finish the remaining half of the bucket.</p>
<p>Seeing that the baby bear was full, the giant bear didn’t continue drawing water. It extended its claws and picked up Zhou Wen and the baby bear before placing them back on its back. Then, it turned around and walked into the forest.</p>
<p>The giant bear passed through the forest and soon arrived in front of a mountain-like building</p>
<p>Laojun Platform? Zhou Wen took a careful look. Although the building was somewhat different from the pictures he had seen of Laojun Platform, it looked mostly correct.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform was many times taller than before. Conservatively speaking, it was already more than a hundred meters tall.</p>
<p>Although Laojun Platform was much taller, it scaled in the same ratio, so it didn’t look too different. Even the steps were the same-only 33 steps.</p>
<p>One step was now two to three meters tall. It would be difficult for ordinary people to climb</p>
<p>It was no problem for the giant bear. It used all its limbs and climbed up step by step.</p>
<p>I was planning on going up Laojun Platform to take a look. Perfect, I don’t even have to walk on my own. I’m riding a bear up. This treatment can be considered unique, right? Zhou Wen sat stably on the giant bear as the baby bear kept pestering him, constantly leaning against him.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform was almost right in front of him. Zhou Wen sized up the top of the door and saw that the words engraved on it weren’t Laojun Platform, but Immortal Ascension Platform.</p>
<p>The door to the Immortal Ascension Platform was closed. He couldn’t see anything inside from the outside. The giant bear had already sprawled at the door instead of rushing in immediately. Zhou Wen’s gaze was attracted by a pair of doors on both sides of the entrance. The door was shaped like a vertical drum. The drum’s surface was engraved with the symbol of two dragons playing with a pearl. And above the door was a beast-like sculpture. It had deformed due to age, making it impossible to tell what creature it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying the strange beast on the door when the giant bear suddenly leaped up and pounced at the door. In the next second, there was a boom.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1482'>Chapter 1482 Smashing the Door</h3>
<p>The giant bear stood on its hind legs and threw its front claws at the door, causing it to rumble. The door shook violently as though it would fly off at any moment, but it ultimately held still.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! The giant bear slammed the door with its claws again and again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, This is Laojun Platform, the place where Taishang Laojun ascended. It would be strange if you could open it with brute force.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still having this thought when he suddenly heard something amiss. He hurriedly crawled onto the giant bear’s shoulder and looked in the direction of the door. He saw that there were already many cracks on it.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! No way? This can be opened with brute force? Zhou Wen’s heart chilled.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had never tried striking the door on Laojun Platform, he had tried many things at Mount Laojun. Ignoring the door, even the grass and trees on Golden Peak seemed to be protected by immortal power, preventing him from dealing any damage.</p>
<p>A place like Laojun Platform was definitely not inferior to Mount Laojun. It could only be stronger than Mount Laojun based on the taboo powers. As the place where Laojun ascended, it was unimaginable that the door would crack.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be said that the door wasn’t firm enough, nor could it be said that the protection of Laojun Platform wasn’t potent enough. It could only be said that this bear was too terrifying</p>
<p>Where did this bear come from? Zhou Wen was somewhat glad that he hadn’t attacked earlier on. His mind raced as he searched for myths related to bears.</p>
<p>However, the myths related to bears were basically from ancient times. Too few were passed down, so Zhou Wen only knew a few.</p>
<p>There were myths like the dream-entering flying bear, Yu the Great’s transformation into a bear, and so on. However, when he compared them, they didn’t look like this blue bear.</p>
<p>I’ve heard legends of red and black bears. For example, the Black Bear Spirit in Journey to the West is a black bear, but I’ve never heard of a blue bear. Could it be from another district? Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the myths and legends of the other districts. No special bear-type Mythical creature came to mind.</p>
<p>The famous Frost Bear was white. Even if it was blue, it was still frost-blue. This bear was grayish-blue and didn’t have any ice-elemental attributes.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>As the bear struck, more and more cracks appeared on the door-it was almost on the brink of shattering.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the baby bear lay on the giant bear’s shoulder as the splattering wood splinters hit them. Zhou Wen picked up a piece of wood and saw a faint golden glow flowing in it. It didn’t look like an ordinary piece of wood.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pinched it hard. His strength was infinitely close to the Calamity grade. Logically speaking, it was just a piece of wood. Many of the fibers had been destroyed, but he failed to deform the wooden splinter.</p>
<p>Boom! A hole was smashed through by the bear’s claws. The giant bear kept exerting its strength as it widened the hole. In just moments, the two door panels were smashed to pieces by the giant bear.</p>
<p>The giant bear clawed at the ground and crawled through the broken door.</p>
<p>The space on Laojun Platform wasn’t big to begin with. After dimensionalization, it was only a few hundred square meters. On the right was the Numinous Treasure Hall, and on the left was the God of Fortune Hall. Together with the main hall, there were only three halls. Doors to all three halls were tightly shut. It was unknown what gods were consecrated inside.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was still observing the area, the giant bear turned right the moment it entered and arrived in front of a metal column that was embedded in the ground.</p>
<p>The metal column was thicker than a person’s thigh. It revealed a portion above ground that was more than a meter long. Its top was oval in shape and it looked somewhat strange overall.</p>
<p>The metal column was covered in rust and had probably been here for countless years.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Laojun Platform. He had never been here before, so he didn’t know what the metal column was.</p>
<p>The bear stood up again and hugged the metal column with its claws, about to pull it out.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The giant bear suddenly exerted strength that could uproot a mountain, but it only managed to raise the metal column slightly.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform shook as though there was an earthquake.</p>
<p>The giant bear continued exerting its strength, roaring as it tried to pull out the metal column. It crossed its claws and hugged the metal column tightly, pulling it up bit by bit.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform kept trembling as the three palace halls shook. However, their doors remained tightly shut as though there was no one guarding the area. Zhou Wen wore an odd expression as he thought to himself, Isn’t it said that Laojun Platform is personally protected by Taishang Laojun? Why isn’t there any reaction at this moment? Could it be that the legend is wrong? This isn’t the true place Taishang Laojun ascended?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of something else. Could it be that this bear is so terrifying that the power protecting Laojun Platform doesn’t dare stop him?</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he found it possible. The taboo power of Laojun Platform couldn’t be faked. It was very similar to the taboo power at Mount Laojun. With so many terrifying creatures guarding Mount Laojun, it was impossible for there to be none</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>The only possibility was that the guards here were afraid of the giant bear and didn’t dare stop it.</p>
<p>The giant bear had already pulled out more than a meter of the metal column. It didn’t take long to fully pull it out.</p>
<p>The huge metal column was like a toy in the giant bear’s hands. It sniffed it for a while before looking as though it had been exposed. It grabbed the metal column and threw it out with both paws.</p>
<p>With a boom, the metal column tore through the main hall’s wall. It stabbed through most of the way, with only the end exposed.</p>
<p>Even so, the door to the hall remained tightly shut.</p>
<p>What are the origins of this bear? Zhou Wen found it even more terrifying.</p>
<p>He hadn’t managed to cause much damage when grinding the Mount Laojun dungeon. A few steps were enough to get him killed.</p>
<p>It seemed silent despite the bear being close to destroying the place. It seemed abnormal.</p>
<p>The giant bear seemed furious as it rushed to the door of the main hall. It extended its bear paw and slapped it a few more times as it roared angrily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s forehead broke out into a cold sweat. To mess with Taishang Laojun’s place was akin to having a death wish. Was he tired of living?</p>
<p>If he were to give the deities a ranking, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of anyone who could be ranked above him even if the bear wasn’t first.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the main hall’s door was much sturdier than the mountain entrance. The bear slapped it a few times, but the door wasn’t damaged. All it did was produce a loud bang.</p>
<p>As though it knew that it couldn’t smash open the door, the giant bear clawed at the ground and circled the door a few times before walking to the left.</p>
<p>On the left side of the main hall was a stone platform with a stone calabash on it. The giant bear came in front of the stone platform and circled it twice.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen imagined that it was about to strike the stone calabash and stone platform again, the bear suddenly extended its claws and lifted Zhou Wen and the baby bear with one swipe of its claws before placing them in front of the stone platform.</p>
<p>The baby bear unhappily turned around and crawled towards the giant bear. The giant bear extended its claws and carried it to the stone platform. It even nudged the baby bear and Zhou Wen. From the looks of it, it wanted them to do something to the stone platform.</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this? Could it be that it doesn’t feel satisfied smashing things alone and wants us to hone our skills and smash things with it? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1483'>Chapter 1483 Stone Calabash</h3>
<p>The giant bear flared up when it saw Zhou Wen and the baby bear remain motionless. It pushed Zhou Wen and the bear to the side and stood in front of the stone platform. Its claws formed a hug before it moved up and down in the air a few times. Then, it turned its head and roared at Zhou Wen and the baby bear.</p>
<p>What do you mean? Teaching us how to wreak havoc via example? Do you want us to smash this calabash and stone platform? Zhou Wen felt that the giant bear was using its actions to get them to carry the calabash and stone platform and lift them up before throwing them to the ground.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was still thinking, the giant bear roared at the two of them again and nudged them with its claws, almost pushing them onto the stone platform.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, That baby bear is silly. It probably can’t comprehend the giant bear’s intentions. Now is the time for me to showcase myself.</p>
<p>Roar! With this in mind, Zhou Wen mimicked the giant bear and roared. He even extended his claws, wanting to pound his chest.</p>
<p>But on second thought, that was a gorilla’s action. Bears probably didn’t do such things. He hurriedly lowered his hands and stole a glance at the giant bear.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the giant bear didn’t mind. Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved. He extended his claws and hugged the calabash, hoping to lift it up and smash it.</p>
<p>Since the giant bear was around, Laojun Platform would pin the blame on the giant bear even if it wanted to settle scores.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen believed that he was quite good at wreaking havoc. As he tried to pick up the stone calabash and smash it to the ground, the stone calabash remained motionless despite him exerting his strength. It had no intention of being lifted.</p>
<p>The stone calabash was only about two feet tall and didn’t look too heavy. In order to pull off his act as a baby bear, Zhou Wen used very little strength. Seeing that he couldn’t move it, he secretly used more strength.</p>
<p>The calabash didn’t budge as though it had been welded to the stone platform below.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen increased his strength and tried a few more times, but the outcome was the same every time. The calabash didn’t show any movement.</p>
<p>What’s up with this stone calabash? Could it be that this thing is a treasure? But if it’s really a treasure, why would it be placed outside? It should be stored in the hall. Zhou Wen sized up the stone calabash and was momentarily unsure of its origins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen regretted not carefully studying what was present on Laojun Platform before coming</p>
<p>He never expected such a situation. Laojun Platform wasn’t a threat to him. He had come here to deal with the giant bear, but things had turned out this way.</p>
<p>The baby bear seemed intrigued by Zhou Wen’s actions. It tottered over with its plump body and pushed Zhou Wen to the side. It wrapped its four paws around the stone calabash.</p>
<p>It must be a joke if you can lift it while I can’t, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>However, now that the baby bear had taken the initiative, it could be considered as helping him out. Zhou Wen was rather grateful to it.</p>
<p>While the baby bear was hugging the calabash, Zhou Wen realized that there were clouds and dragon patterns engraved on it. A dragon shuttled through the clouds-its body mostly hidden. It emitted a refreshing and elegant aura.</p>
<p>The baby bear was a simpleton. It hugged the stone calabash and had no intention of lifting it up. It even wanted to bite it as though it wanted to know if it could be eaten.</p>
<p>After biting it twice to no avail, it even gestured at the calabash with his front claws as though it wanted to know if it could swallow the calabash.</p>
<p>If you can eat this thing, I’ll respect you as a man! Just as Zhou Wen had this thought, he suddenly saw the calabash glow.</p>
<p>Golden light seeped out from the cloud patterns. There was seemingly something inside the originally solid stone calabash.</p>
<p>It was naturally impossible for the stone calabash to have a hole, but now, there was a golden glow at the top of the calabash. Then, a golden object spewed out from the calabash’s mouth amidst the luminance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only saw a Golden Elixir Pill spew out before the baby bear opened its mouth and swallowed it.</p>
<p>After swallowing it, the baby bear even smacked its lips as though it wasn’t satisfied.</p>
<p>The baby bear wanted more. It hugged the calabash and began gnawing. It was unknown how it did it, but soon, another pill spewed out.</p>
<p>The baby bear opened its mouth and swallowed it. Zhou Wen didn’t even see what the pill looked like as it shimmered with golden light.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the pill, Zhou Wen saw a faint golden luster appear on the baby bear’s fur. Furthermore, it emitted a refreshing fragrance.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me that the pills that fly out of the calabash… are Taishang Laojun’s Golden Elixir Pills… Zhou Wen’s eyes nearly popped out.</p>
<p>The baby bear chewed and chewed one pill after another. It left Zhou Wen envious.</p>
<p>This was Taishang Laojun’s territory. The pills that appeared were likely immortal pills. Even if they weren’t the famous Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir Pill, they were definitely not ordinary.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen understood that the giant bear wasn’t here to wreak havoc, but to eat the immortal pills.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to slap himself. He had failed to seize such a good opportunity. He was the one who had hugged the calabash first.</p>
<p>Who knew that this would happen? That giant bear was so violent the moment it came here. I thought it wanted… Zhou Wen was filled with regret, but it was useless. All he could do was wait by the side, hoping that the baby bear would quickly release the calabash and give him the opportunity to get two immortal pills.</p>
<p>However, the baby bear seemed to have a huge appetite. It didn’t seem satiated despite eating seven or eight pills. It continued gnawing away.</p>
<p>Eat, eat, eat. All you know is to eat. Look at your figure. How are you going to find a life partner in the future? Which bear chick will like you? Get yourself together. Stop eating and start losing weight. Zhou Wen kept muttering inwardly.</p>
<p>It was unknown if the baby bear heard his thoughts or if it was really full, but it released the stone calabash and rolled to the side. It lay on its back, panting. Its belly swelled up as though it was stuffed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly crawled over and hugged the calabash with his claws. Ignoring the saliva of the baby bear on the calabash, he opened his mouth and chewed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t bite through the stone calabash. He was only imitating the baby bear’s actions.</p>
<p>After a while, the calabash shimmered with golden light as a pill spewed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw this. He hurriedly opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.</p>
<p>When the pill entered his stomach, a strange force immediately spread out. It was an extremely strange feeling-he couldn’t put his finger on whether it was hot or cold.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1484'>Chapter 1484 The Mysterious Laojun Platform</h3>
<p>A cold yet hot force spread through his body. The feeling was indescribable as his body seemed to turn ethereal as though he was about to ascend to immortality. It became lighter and lighter. Zhou Wen felt that his body would be blown away by a mere breeze.</p>
<p>Of course, that was only what Zhou Wen felt. He naturally wasn’t blown away.</p>
<p>Not only was he not blown away, but his body also became heavier—the bricks beneath him shattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lowered his head to bite the calabash and got a few more pills out for eating, but as he lowered his head, his body gradually turned to stone.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen’s mouth touched the calabash, his body was completely petrified, turning into a stone beast statue hugging the stone calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t move, but he was still conscious. He felt as light as a feather, so he failed to react to the petrification.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what’s going on? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He clearly felt ethereal and airy, as though a gust of wind could blow him away at any time, but he had petrified into an immobile rock.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that he couldn’t use any of his Essence Energy Arts, nor could he circulate his Essence Energy. It was as though he had really become a rock.</p>
<p>Could it be that the giant bear knew that this would happen, so it deliberately brought us here to eat the pills? If I were really its cub, I wouldn’t have turned into a rock, so it can distinguish who its child is. Zhou Wen felt extremely ambivalent.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen turn into a stone statue, the giant bear lifted the baby bear onto its back before turning to head out the door. It walked down the stone steps as though it had verified Zhou Wen’s thoughts.</p>
<p>As for the baby bear, it would occasionally turn its head to look at Zhou Wen. It even called out twice as though it wanted him to follow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t move, so how could he follow? All he could do was watch helplessly as they descended Laojun Platform and vanished from Zhou Wen’s senses.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to calm down and attempt to use all sorts of powers to escape the present predicament.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t use Essence Energy Arts or summon Companion Beasts. He couldn’t even move his body, so there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Could it be that I’ll become a stone statue just like that and be alone for millennia? Zhou Wen was depressed, but he didn’t give up on survival. He only hoped for beneficial developments.</p>
<p>Time ticked by, but Zhou Wen failed to recover from his stone statue state.</p>
<p>Why was the baby bear fine after eating it, but I ended up turning into a rock? That baby bear doesn’t look like a stone-elemental creature. In terms of immunity, with Truth Listener and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, I shouldn’t be that weak… What kind of powers do the Golden Elixir Pills have? Zhou Wen kept thinking, hoping to find the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>However, even when the sky darkened and the moon rose, he still couldn’t figure out what kind of power the Golden Elixir Pills possessed.</p>
<p>The cold moonlight shone on Laojun Platform, as though it had covered the originally mysterious Laojun Platform with a veil.</p>
<p>There was complete silence. Zhou Wen could still hear, but the range was limited to the vicinity of Laojun Platform. Furthermore, it was only normal hearing, not Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>He could see with his eyes, but all he could see was what was in front of him.</p>
<p>Sir is still waiting for me to return. I have to think of a way to quickly escape. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly heard something strange.</p>
<p>It sounded like someone was speaking, but it was indiscernible. It was like murmurs one heard in their reverie, but it was impossible to tell what was being said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t sleeping, so he naturally wasn’t daydreaming. He listened attentively. He could clearly hear the sound, and it wasn’t so soft that it was indiscernible, but he couldn’t hear what was being said clearly. Zhou Wen couldn’t even be sure if the sound was human. Unfortunately, his body couldn’t move, and the direction of the sound wasn’t in his field of vision.</p>
<p>After listening for a while, Zhou Wen could tell that the sound was coming from the main hall.</p>
<p>With that giant bear around, ordinary people wouldn’t dare come to Laojun Platform. Even if they dared, I wouldn’t be unable to hear anything when they ascended Laojun Platform. Could it be that the sound comes from the main hall? With this in mind, Zhou Wen felt a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what was inside the hall, but he believed that it was most likely Taishang Laojun. If the sound really came from the main hall, it might be something profound.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Zhou Wen listened, he couldn’t tell what the voice was saying. After a while, the voice gradually vanished.</p>
<p>In the morning, Zhou Wen saw a purple glow land in front of him. It was indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>The purple light came from the east. Zhou Wen was on the west side of the main temple, and he couldn’t see what was emitting the purple light either.</p>
<p>After a while, the purple light deviated and shone on him.</p>
<p>No, it should be said that it shone on the stone calabash. Zhou Wen was surprised to discover the stone calabash automatically emitting a golden glow as it sucked the purple gas into the calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was illuminated by the purple light by virtue of him hugging the calabash. He felt his body warm up. His mind, which had been in disarray the entire night, immediately felt refreshed as though he had just woken up. The purple light didn’t last long. After a while, the angle of the purple light deviated, preventing it from reaching this spot. The stone calabash returned to its original state, and Zhou Wen wasn’t illuminated by the purple light again. For the next two to three days, Zhou Wen failed to think of a way to escape. He would hear that strange whisper every night at midnight. And in the morning, he would see the purple light.</p>
<p>When the purple light shone on him, he vaguely felt that his body was showing signs of recovery. However, the time for the illumination was too short. Before he could be treated of the petrification, the purple light had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Although he knew that time was of the essence and that Yu Qiubai was definitely having a hard time holding on, there was nothing he could do. All he could do was patiently listen to the murmurs every night and try his best to absorb the purple light like the calabash.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t easy. It was clearly difficult to take the initiative to absorb the purple light without using an Essence Energy Art. Zhou Wen kept trying, but he failed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see any traces of the giant bear or the baby bear again. Instead, the door that had been destroyed by the giant bear automatically returned to normal the next day.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen occasionally heard dimensional creatures wandering around Laojun Platform, but no dimensional creature dared to ascend it.</p>
<p>There weren’t even any dimensional creatures that went up the stairs. At most, they would circle around the steps for a while before leaving</p>
<h3 id='chapter1485'>Chapter 1485 Someone’s Here</h3>
<p>In the morning, Zhou Wen was enjoying the purple light when he suddenly heard footsteps coming from below Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that he had heard wrongly, but he immediately heard someone speak.</p>
<p>“Old man, are you sure it’s here?” A lazy man’s voice sounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the voice familiar and his expression immediately turned odd. This was because the voice sounded like Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun.</p>
<p>No way? Why is Liu Yun here? Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although Liu Yun was his eldest senior brother, it was difficult to describe their relationship. After all, Liu Yun had often tried scamming Zhou Wen in the past, but he always suffered losses every time. Zhou Wen was only passively counterattacking in the beginning, but over time, he couldn’t help but take the initiative to bully this eldest senior brother.</p>
<p>Their relationship couldn’t be considered good, but it wasn’t necessarily bad. No matter what Liu Yun thought, Zhou Wen had never thought of doing anything to Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun. He had never even treated him as an enemy.</p>
<p>This feeling was very strange. He was clearly someone who wanted to scam him the moment they met, but he didn’t think of him as an enemy.</p>
<p>“The place where Laojun ascended should be here. There’s no mistake about it.” An elderly voice sounded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard the voice. This was because he was familiar with the voice. It was likely Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Why is Liu Yun still with Jing Daoxian? Hasn’t he suffered enough from colluding with him? Could it be that Jing Daoxian pulled some trick on Liu Yun, forcing him to obey his orders? Zhou Wen had always been puzzled as to why Liu Yun often ended up working with Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Later on, on careful thought, Liu Yun had been captured by Jing Daoxian in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang. It was very likely that he had been tricked by Jing Daoxian and was coerced by him. “That might not be the case. Many places claim to have a relationship with Taishang Laojun. You said the same thing back in my hometown. What happened in the end?” Liu Yun mocked.</p>
<p>“This great immortal is the founder of Daoism. Everyone wants to rub off some blessings, causing the information to be messy. We need to slowly verify them. This Laojun Platform is indeed the place where Laojun ascended. As long as no one comes before us, that thing should still be here,” Jing Daoxian said slowly. “Let’s wait and see. I don’t dare have such high hopes.” Liu Yun still didn’t seem to believe Jing Daoxian’s judgment. As he spoke, he walked up the stairs, but he was stopped by Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“The 33 steps of Laojun Platform represent the 33 Heavens. Every step is a heaven. It’s not something that can be easily ascended,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing special about it.” Liu Yun sized up the steps and felt that other than being a little taller, there was nothing special.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen listened, the more puzzled he became. He had been carried up here by the giant bear and didn’t find the stairs impressive. However, Jing Daoxian’s tone made it seem like even he didn’t dare underestimate the 33 steps.</p>
<p>“Daoism emphasizes returning to the basics. The more inconspicuous a place is, the more careful you have to be. Otherwise, you having ten lives wouldn’t be enough if I’m not by your side,” Jing Daoxian said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’ve been traveling alone for so many years. Ain’t I still living well?” Liu Yun said disapprovingly. “You can give it a try if you don’t believe me,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.</p>
<p>“Sure.” As Liu Yun spoke, he jumped up the stairs.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly couldn’t hear him after Liu Yun landed on the steps. However, Liu Yun had clearly landed on the first step, so how did he suddenly vanish and go completely silent?</p>
<p>From the looks of it, those stairs are indeed as Jing Daoxian said. They possess unbelievable power. It’s only because I was carried by the giant bear which broke through the stairs’ restrictions that I didn’t sense the existence of that power. As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly heard a tragic cry.</p>
<p>Liu Yun, who seemed to have vanished, fell to the ground away from the steps with a tragic cry as though he had appeared out of thin air. “Of the 33 steps, you couldn’t even last past the seventh step. Aren’t you too weak?” Jing Daoxian mocked.</p>
<p>Liu Yun got up from the ground and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He said stubbornly, “To be able to reach the seventh step shows heavenly talent. A genius like me is already rare in this world. You probably won’t find many in the human world capable of this feat.”</p>
<p>“Which one of your junior brothers isn’t stronger than you?” Jing Daoxian said airily.</p>
<p>“I’m just letting them have it easy. I don’t want to bully the weak on account of us being fellow disciples,” Liu Yun said as he cracked his neck.</p>
<p>“Luoyang’s An Tianzuo, the Dugu family’s Dugu Ge, the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu, and the Xia family’s Xia Liuchuan, none of them should be inferior to you, right? There’s also that punk from the Feng family in the south sea and the Ming family’s kid that uses a sword. They aren’t much weaker than you, right? Geniuses like you don’t seem to be that rare.” Jing Daoxian listed down several examples.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was immediately displeased. “How can Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu be my match? An Tianzuo can at most fight me to a draw. They can barely be considered on the same level. I’m not afraid of the others.”</p>
<p>“When you mention a draw, is it like that time at Dragon Gate Grotto in Luoyang? He chased as you ran, but that he failed to catch up to you? That’s right. As long as you aren’t dead, it’s a draw,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Liu Yun was alarmed as he glared at Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“I know plenty.” Jing Daoxian didn’t answer him. He looked at the steps in front of him and said, “These 33 steps are the distance between heaven and earth. It’s the process of advancing from a mortal to an immortal. If you can reach the 33rd step at the Epic stage with your own abilities, you can break through the limits of the Deva Realm and advance to the Mythical stage with your body. Unfortunately, no one in the world can do it.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Jing Daoxian said, “Follow me. Let’s head up now.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jing Daoxian walked up the steps. Liu Yun followed closely behind him.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear their voices as though they had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard their voices again, it was more than an hour later. Jing Daoxian and Liu Yun had already arrived at the door.</p>
<p>The door that had been smashed by the giant bear had returned to its original state. It was impossible to tell that it had been smashed before.</p>
<p>“This door can’t be opened with brute force. If one tries to force their way in, they might be thrown out of Laojun Platform.” Jing Daoxian looked at the door and slowly walked to it before knocking on it.</p>
<p>He knocked on the door with a strange rhythm. After knocking a few times, the door automatically opened.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that the door is very difficult to open? Why did it open just by knocking?” Liu Yun naturally knew that something was amiss. He had said that to get Jing Daoxian to explain the oddity.</p>
<p>As Jing Daoxian walked into the yard, he said, “This is the Door of the Deva Realm. As long as one breaks through the limits of the Deva Realm, they will naturally be able to open it. Therefore, I can open it, but you can’t.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1486'>Chapter 1486 Grandson</h3>
<p>“What’s there to be proud of?” Liu Yun muttered as he followed Jing Daoxian into the yard.</p>
<p>When they arrived in the yard, Jing Daoxian’s expression changed when he saw the metal column that the giant bear had stabbed into the wall. “Someone was here before us.”</p>
<p>With that said, Jing Daoxian walked to the wall and reached out to gently stroke the exposed parts of the metal column. At the same time, he carefully sized it up.</p>
<p>“It should be Teacher, right? It looks like you’re one step too late,” Liu Yun said gloatingly.</p>
<p>“Whose grandson are you?” Jing Daoxian glared at him.</p>
<p>“Who knows if you’re bluffing me. How do I know that you’re telling the truth?” Liu Yun curled his lips.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t my only grandchild, I would have already slapped you to death,” Jing Daoxian said coldly. Then, he released his hand that was caressing the metal column and took two steps back. “I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you. It’s not Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan wouldn’t do something so senseless.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned. Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun is actually Jing Daoxian’s grandson? It’s no wonder I had a nagging feeling that something was amiss-why is Liu Yun always with Jing Daoxian? That explains it! After his shock, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel a burning desire for gossip. Liu Yun is sing Daoxian’s grandson, so who’s his grandmother? Didn’t they say that Jing Daoxian didn’t marry and have children?</p>
<p>“What’s senseless?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“This metal column is called the Mountain-Driving Whip. It should have been something good, but unfortunately, this one is fake. The person who came before us realized that this metal column was fake and flew into a rage, smashing it into the wall. With Wang Mingyuan’s personality, he definitely wouldn’t do such a thing,” Jing Daoxian said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. If it’s Teacher, he would put it back when he discovers that it’s fake,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian gave a strange smile. “That’s also possible. However, if I were to guess, I believe he would take away this fake Mountain-Driving Whip.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Because I will do the same,” Jing Daoxian said as he reached out to pull out the metal column.</p>
<p>It was difficult to stick the metal column in, but it was equally difficult to pull it out. Jing Daoxian pulled a few times, but the metal column seemed to be firmly stuck in the wall.</p>
<p>“Since it’s fake, why waste time pulling it out?” Liu Yun asked again.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand.” Jing Daoxian summoned a Companion Beast. Zhou Wen could tell that it was a humanoid Companion Beast. Without Truth Listener’s augmentation, he couldn’t turn the sound he heard into an image. All he could do was make a general judgment. With the help of the humanoid Companion Beast, the metal column was slowly pulled out</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian used some unknown method to stroke the metal pillar, causing it to vanish.</p>
<p>“It’s about time. If we don’t get down to business, I’m afraid we will lose our lives here when that bear returns,” said Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“That Luck Stone should be on the west side of the main hall. You can see it if you take a look,” Jing Daoxian said. Liu Yun walked west and immediately saw the stone platform, calabash, and Zhou Wen. Now that Zhou Wen was in the form of a stone beast, Liu Yun naturally couldn’t recognize him. He was even given a fright as he pointed at Zhou Wen and said, “That’s strange. Didn’t you say that the Luck Stone is with a treasure calabash? Why is there a stone beast there? Could it be that there’s a Luck Beast that comes with it?”</p>
<p>“What Luck Beast?” Jing Daoxian frowned slightly as he walked to Liu Yun’s side and was slightly taken aback when he saw the stone beast Zhou Wen had transformed into. “Strange. The Luck Stone is a stone roller used by Taishang Laojun to grind medicine. The treasure calabash is used to store pills, but I’ve never heard of any guardian beast. Even if there is one, it should be a child guarding the furnace. It shouldn’t be such a strange stone beast…” As Jing Daoxian sized up Zhou Wen, he pondered and said, “Furthermore, this stone beast looks somewhat similar to that bear…” Zhou Wen thought to himself, I don’t think Jing Daoxian has seen the baby bear before. The baby bear doesn’t resemble the giant bear either. To be able to tell, Jing Daoxian’s eyes are indeed a little sharp.</p>
<p>“Who cares? Anyway, what you want is the Luck Stone and the treasure calabash. Just take them away,” Liu Yun said as he moved the stone calabash.</p>
<p>However, after exerting some strength, the calabash remained motionless. Liu Yun exerted so much strength that the veins on his forehead protruded.</p>
<p>“Don’t waste your efforts. Although the treasure calabash isn’t a purple-gold calabash, it’s no ordinary item. It won’t be easy to take it away. If we could use brute force to take it away, the people who came before us would have long done so without giving us a chance.” Jing Daoxian paused before saying, “From the looks of it, we came at the right time. These are all genuine.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a solution?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“These two treasures are used for alchemy. If you want to take them away, you naturally have to work from a pill angle,” Jing Daoxian said as he took out something</p>
<p>It was a small bottle that was only the size of a palm. Jing Daoxian carefully opened the bottle and poured out a tiny pill before throwing it at the stone calabash.</p>
<p>The stone calabash that would only react in the morning suddenly shimmered with golden light as it sucked in the tiny pill.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian threw the tiny bottle to Liu Yun. “Feed that calabash with a pill every ten minutes. In a few hours, you should be able to move the treasure calabash.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you feed it yourself?” Liu Yun seemed to enjoy arguing with Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian said indifferently, “If that bear returns, I’ll have to think of a way to stop it outside. We have to be wary of the people from before in the event that they haven’t left.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that there aren’t more than five creatures on Earth who can fight that bear? And none of them are human? Then how are you going to stop it?” Liu Yun was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Silly child, you sometimes have to use your brain. Something that can’t be done with brute force might be easily done with some trivial means. In short, stay here and feed that treasure calabash. No matter what happens outside, don’t come out,” Jing Daoxian said as he walked out the door and closed it.</p>
<p>“Who knows if all these opinionated things you say are true.” As Liu Yun muttered, he waited before throwing a pill at the calabash.</p>
<p>Strangely, every time he threw a pill and pushed the treasure calabash, he felt that it was a little lighter.</p>
<p>“Old man, are you outside?” Liu Yun was a person who couldn’t sit idle. After waiting for a while, he felt bored and shouted outside.</p>
<p>No one answered him. Liu Yun asked a few times, but when Jing Daoxian didn’t respond, he stopped shouting, probably because his voice couldn’t be heard.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s eyes darted as he looked at Zhou Wen. As though he had thought of something fun, he got up and walked towards him.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what are you going to do? Zhou Wen immediately felt that things were going south, but he couldn’t move or make a sound. He couldn’t do anything but watch as Liu Yun walked to his side.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1487'>Chapter 1487 Liu Yun’s Concerns</h3>
<p>Liu Yun circled Zhou Wen a few times before standing in front of him. He stared at his face carefully and gradually frowned.</p>
<p>“Strange. It’s clearly a stone statue. Why does it have a sense of familiarity while inducing some hate?” Liu Yun looked at the stone beast and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>This punk’s spiritual perception is so sharp! Zhou Wen was given a fright, afraid that Liu Yun would notice.</p>
<p>He had scammed Liu Yun many times. If Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t move after becoming a stone statue, who knew how he would take revenge on him.</p>
<p>“The more I look at it, the more I find it irritating.” Liu Yun’s eyes darted around as he walked in front of him and reached out to pull his pants.</p>
<p>No… No way… Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had the urge to turn around and escape. He guessed what Liu Yun was up to.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t escape at all. He couldn’t even close his eyes.</p>
<p>Piss!</p>
<p>A clear fountain drenched the stone beast’s front legs, giving Zhou Wen the urge to kick Liu Yun to death.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that Liu Yun was constantly raising the angle of the fountain launcher, causing the liquid to spray even higher.</p>
<p>“How is it? Are you ashamed? You’ve never seen such a majestic treasure, right? An existence as talented as me is one in a billion among humans. It’s your good fortune to be able to see my treasure. If you have the chance to be reincarnated in your next life, remember to grow like me. Don’t be as irritating as you are now. However, you don’t have to think about having such a huge asset like me. To have a third of it is something you will enjoy for the rest of your life…” Liu Yun boasted as he sprayed.</p>
<p>Why don’t the heavens smite this fellow to death! Zhou Wen was extremely disgusted. It was fine if his body was defiled, but he had to endure Liu Yun’s psychological attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used all his strength to escape the petrification’s restraints, but it was useless. The Essence Energy and strength in his body didn’t obey his orders as though they had also been petrified.</p>
<p>“Watch my Sea-Emerging Twin Dragons… Fountain to the Nine Heavens…” Liu Yun sprayed higher and higher until he was about to spray Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Die… Die… Die… Zhou Wen screamed inwardly as he struggled with all his might, but it was useless.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly felt his body turn heavy. The ethereal feeling vanished as his body was dispelled of its petrified state.</p>
<p>After a plume of white smoke appeared, Zhou Wen returned to his original appearance from his petrified state.</p>
<p>This sudden development left Zhou Wen and Liu Yun stunned.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Two screams nearly overlapped as Zhou Wen quickly retreated. Liu Yun zipped up as he retreated, but in his panic, his flesh was caught in the zipper. “Holy sh*t… Holy sh*t…” Liu Yun’s face turned livid from the pain as he held his crouch and jumped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly took off his shirt and threw it far away. One of his sleeves was wet.</p>
<p>“Are you f*cking sick? You turned into a stone statue to peep at me pee!?” Liu Yun composed himself and pointed at Zhou Wen as he stomped his feet.</p>
<p>“Pui! You’re the f*cking sick one. You’re a human, not a beast. Instead of using the bathroom, you came all the way here to Laojun Platform to relieve yourself? Aren’t you afraid Lord Laojun will smite you?” Zhou Wen immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“It’s my business where I want to relieve myself. Why? Are you feeling inferior because of my asset? It’s fine. It’s only right for the senior brother’s to be bigger than the junior brother’s… Besides, you are the youngest junior brother…” Liu Yun deliberately emphasized the word ‘youngest.’</p>
<p>“Asset? You mean that bean sprout?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.</p>
<p>“F*ck you. You’re just jealous. Can that bean sprout of yours…”</p>
<p>The two of them cursed each other for a while until they were out of cuss words. Both their mouths were dry.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen leaned against the wall and panted while Liu Yun took out a pill to feed the treasure calabash.</p>
<p>“I never expected you to be Jing Daoxian’s grandson. It’s no wonder you were so certain that Jing Daoxian wouldn’t harm you,” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression after taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun finished feeding the treasure calabash, his expression turned odd when he heard Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Looking at the door and seeing that it was tightly shut, Liu Yun lowered his voice and said, “Jing Daoxian is very certain that I’m his grandson. He treats me pretty well, but Teacher said that I’m not Jing Daoxian’s grandson.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. “How can a person like Jing Daoxian not know who his family is? But Teacher isn’t someone who speaks nonsense…”</p>
<p>“That’s why I don’t know who to believe. Logically speaking, it’s impossible for the old man… I mean Jing Daoxian to make a mistake, but Teacher’s words have never been wrong.” Liu Yun was also depressed.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you ask your parents?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“My parents are long dead. How am I to ask? Should I slit my throat and find them?” Liu Yun rolled his eyes at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Then how can Jing Daoxian be sure that you are his grandson?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“How would I know? After we met him in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang, he made the baffling statement that I was his grandson, but he didn’t tell me the reason. I originally thought that he was deliberately taking advantage of me, but later, he gave me quite a number of benefits. His actions made it seem like it was true,” Liu Yun said gloomily.</p>
<p>With that said, Liu Yun suddenly came to Zhou Wen’s side and grabbed his collar. He stared at him and almost stuck to his face. He said with a heavy expression, “Let me ask you a question. You have to answer me honestly.”</p>
<p>“Just shoot. Why are you grabbing me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Liu Yun didn’t let go. He continued grabbing him and asked, “Why did you suddenly come here and become a stone beast? Did Teacher ask you to come?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t plan on transforming into a stone beast. Here’s what happened.” Zhou Wen recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>After Liu Yun heard that, his expression softened a little. However, he still asked worriedly, “Was it really not Teacher who asked you to come?”</p>
<p>“No,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty. Then, he looked at Liu Yun and asked, “Are you suspecting that Teacher is up to something?”</p>
<p>Liu Yun released Zhou Wen’s collar and said with an odd expression, “It’s not that I’m suspicious, but I find it terrifying. Don’t you think that there’s something wrong with Teacher?”</p>
<p>“Of course something’s amiss. He has already become the Dragon King of the dimension,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about us disciples. I’ve been treated as a grandson by Jing Daoxian, and Hui Haifeng has become president. Little Ya is the president of the Holy Spirit Association. If I’m not wrong, that Immortal from the League of Guardians is very likely Jiang Yan. Together with you, all the disciples he took in don’t seem simple. He took in those few disciples after all those years, but they all have achievements that ordinary people can’t achieve. Don’t you find it very unlikely? Apart from our teacher, have you seen anyone else with such abilities?” Liu Yun said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had actually had such a feeling before, but he didn’t say it out loud like Liu Yun.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1488'>Chapter 1488 The Truth Behind the bet</h3>
<p>“You suspect that it wasn’t a coincidence that Teacher took us in as students?” Although Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious, he still felt that it was unlikely. “Who knows? Anyway, I have a nagging feeling that there’s something wrong.” Liu Yun paused before saying, “Do you still remember the time the old man came to you?”</p>
<p>“The time he made the bet with Teacher?” Zhou Wen naturally remembered the matter.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian had used an alias to get him to help him get on the Cube’s rankings. Zhou Wen had even taken his Companion Beast, but he ultimately didn’t help him get on the rankings.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian acted oddly as well. He said that it was fine if Zhou Wen didn’t help him get on the rankings, and Jing Daoxian really didn’t cause trouble for him. He didn’t even take back the Companion Beast he had given Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Liu Yun nodded and said, “Although my meeting with the old man was a coincidence, Teacher got to know the old man because of me. That resulted in the bet. I keep finding it a little odd.”</p>
<p>“What’s up with that bet?” Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why Jing Daoxian would bluntly tell him the contents of the bet. Jing Daoxian would definitely lose once Zhou Wen learned of the bet after all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always felt that their bet wasn’t as simple as Jing Daoxian had said.</p>
<p>“The content of the bet is actually very simple. Just as the old man told you, if you help him get on the rankings, he wins. If you don’t help him, Teacher wins.”</p>
<p>“Is it really that simple?” Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Liu Yun inhaled before continuing, “The simplicity of the matter depends on how you view it. The final outcome of the bet is this, but there are some additional conditions. Teacher can’t tell you anything about the bet. Only the old man can contact you.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly understood something, but he still looked at Liu Yun and waited for him to explain.</p>
<p>“The old man clearly told you everything, but he’s Jing Daoxian. Do you dare trust him?” Liu Yun asked.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare.” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t dare completely trust Jing Daoxian. In fact, he had previously suspected him.</p>
<p>“That’s right. No one would believe the words of the number one devil in the Federation, Jing Daoxian. Therefore, the more he tells you the truth, the more you will suspect him. Furthermore, Teacher can’t explain it to you in person, so the average person might think too much and help him get on the rankings,” said Liu Yun with a smile. “The old man was betting that you wouldn’t believe him, that you would have some doubts and end up approaching the matter wrong. Unfortunately, he lost the bet. He never expected you to be so determined and not give him a chance.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen smiled bitterly to himself. He wasn’t that determined, but he had been plagued with problems back then that forced him to work on them. He didn’t pay attention to the matter at all.</p>
<p>By the time he recalled this matter, Venus had already exploded. Naturally, the matter was left unsettled.</p>
<p>He never expected his inaction to help Wang Mingyuan defeat Jing Daoxian. This unexpected development was purely unintentional.</p>
<p>“What’s their bet?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Only they know the bet. I don’t know what they were betting on,” Liu Yun said helplessly.</p>
<p>In this world, there weren’t many secrets that Liu Yun couldn’t eavesdrop on. There weren’t many people who could stop him from eavesdropping either. However, this matter happened to involve the two people who could stop him, so Liu Yun really hadn’t heard anything.</p>
<p>ed</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if Liu Yun was lying, but when he thought of Wang Mingyuan and Jing Daoxian’s way of doing things, he felt that the possibility of Liu Yun knowing was slim.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask, “Why did you follow Jing Daoxian to Mount Laojun to take this calabash?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t the old man tell you last time that he won’t live long? He has to find a way to extend his lifespan. The simplest and most direct method is naturally to create the Elixir of Immortality. This calabash and millstone are, according to myth, treasures used by the Laojun for alchemy. They have magical powers. The old man wants to use them for alchemy.” Liu Yun didn’t hesitate as he explained Jing Daoxian’s goal.</p>
<p>As the two of them were chatting, Zhou Wen suddenly heard a roar from below Laojun Platform. A ferocious beast was running towards them.</p>
<p>“Strange!” Zhou Wen circulated Truth Listener to scan the foot of the mountain and realized that the dimensional creature wasn’t the giant bear.</p>
<p>It was a golden monster that looked between a cross of a tiger and lion but neither. It was covered in scales and had horns on its head.</p>
<p>From afar, it looked like the mythical Qilin, but upon closer inspection, it didn’t look like it. He couldn’t tell what kind of creature it</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>Could it be that the terrifying creature that the survivors mentioned is this one? It’s not the giant bear? Zhou Wen immediately realized that he had been wrong from the beginning</p>
<p>He instinctively believed that there was only one Calamity creature on Laojun Platform, but he never expected there to be another. As the saying went, two tigers couldn’t share one mountain. This principle didn’t seem to exist here.</p>
<p>The monster roared as it rushed up the steps of Laojun Platform before disappearing from Zhou Wen’s senses as though it was invisible.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Before long, Zhou Wen sensed a terrifying power erupt on the seventh step. It caused the entire Laojun Platform to tremble violently.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Eighth step… Ninth step… Tenth step…</p>
<p>Terrifying explosive forces were released with every step, causing Laojun Platform to constantly shake.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the old man can withstand it. I have to be quick.” Liu Yun continued feeding the treasure calabash. Every time he fed one pill, he tried moving the treasure calabash. Although it still couldn’t be lifted, it could already be moved. It looked like it wouldn’t take long to lift it.</p>
<p>The terrifying sounds outside continued, but the higher the entity was on the stairs, the slower the pace of explosions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened carefully for a while before saying in surprise, “Jing Daoxian seems to have used the power of the 33 steps to block that dimensional creature. Although that dimensional creature is very strong, it probably won’t be able to rush up anytime</p>
<p>soon.”</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>To his surprise, Zhou Wen heard another roar after finishing his sentence. He saw the blue giant bear storm over and rush up the stairs.</p>
<p>There was a series of crackling sounds as the stone steps were breached. The giant bear charged forward crazily, and Zhou Wen could even see a smoke trail that resembled a dragon behind the giant bear.</p>
<p>“My good grandson, how’s the treasure calabash feeding? I’m afraid I won’t be able to last much longer,” Jing Daoxian said as he pushed open the door and looked inside. “I’m about to be able to lift it. I reckon it can be done after another two or three pills,” Liu Yun answered.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1489'>Chapter 1489 It’s Too Late</h3>
<p>“My good grandson, I can’t last another half an hour. I’m afraid I won’t be able to last that long. I’ll give you another ten minutes. You have to take the item away no matter what.” With that said, Jing Daoxian closed the door again.</p>
<p>“Do you think this is buying vegetables off the streets? You can’t take it away as you wish. Is this something I can control?” Liu Yun was somewhat depressed, but there was no other way.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform kept shaking as the explosions outside approached. He also knew that Jing Daoxian wouldn’t be able to last long.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Liu Yun poured out the pills in the bottle. There were a total of eight pills. Jing Daoxian had instructed him to feed one every ten minutes, but now, he couldn’t care less. He fed one every minute.</p>
<p>Although he knew that such actions might not be of any use and that his previous efforts would be in vain, he had no other choice now. He could only make a Hail Mary effort.</p>
<p>In any case, if he didn’t risk it, he definitely wouldn’t be able to lift the treasure calabash in ten minutes, much less the millstone below.</p>
<p>Liu Yun fed the treasure calabash while Zhou Wen paid attention to the situation outside. The explosions had already reached the 23rd step. Although its speed had slowed down, it only slowed a little.</p>
<p>His estimates were similar to Jing Daoxian’s. It would take at most ten minutes for the two Calamity-grade creatures to rush over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel burdened. Regardless of whether Jing Daoxian and company succeeded or not, it had nothing to do with him. Zhou Wen no longer dared to eat the pills that spewed out of the calabash.</p>
<p>Il.</p>
<p>Liu Yun made attempts as he fed the calabash, but even though he fed it a lot more pills, the weight of the treasure calabash only continued to slowly become lighter. There weren’t any changes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even felt that the treasure calabash’s lightening was slowing down.</p>
<p>Liu Yun clearly realized the situation as he said gloomily, “From the looks of it, it’s impossible for me to take the treasure calabash back today.”</p>
<p>Indeed, after Liu Yun finished feeding the remaining eight pills, he still failed to lift the calabash.</p>
<p>On the steps outside, the terrifying sonic booms had already reached the 30th step. In a few more steps, the two Calamity-grade dimensional creatures would arrive.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, if you still want to carry it, take your time. I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen wanted to find a way to escape Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>However, instant transmission and spatial teleportation were useless. Unless one left through the door, any Essence Energy Art or power was useless.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, don’t waste your time. Laojun Platform is where Laojun ascended to the Immortal Realm. If you really force the use of spatial powers, it will be your good fortune if you can’t teleport out. If you really ended up doing so, I’m afraid you will find yourself in the Immortal Realm,” Liu Yun said as he attempted to move the calabash.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it said that the Immortal Realm is a nice place? It’s not bad to be able to teleport there,” Zhou Wen answered.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, are you really naive? Or are you really stupid? If that place is really that perfect, would you need to be taken there? I’m afraid everyone would be vying to enter,” Liu Yun curled his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen declined to comment. He knew that the Immortal Realm was most likely the dimension, but if it really came to a crisis, he couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how powerful the Qilin-like dimensional creature was, but he had seen the terror of the giant bear with his own eyes. Even if Zhou Wen fought with all his might, he probably wouldn’t be able to gain the upper hand with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>“My good grandson, are you done?” Jing Daoxian pushed open the door again.</p>
<p>“I can’t do a thing. It can’t be moved,” Liu Yun said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Stop the attempt. Follow me.” Jing Daoxian also knew that it would be too late to say anything if the two dimensional creatures rushed over. Therefore, he would rather not have the calabash.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, let’s go.” Liu Yun looked at the calabash reluctantly and beckoned for Zhou Wen to leave.</p>
<p>“You guys leave first. I have my ways of leaving.” Zhou Wen shook his head and rejected Liu Yun’s offer.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian definitely wanted to take the opportunity to rush down when the two dimensional creatures rushed forward and use the stone steps to shake them off.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew the giant bear’s strength too well. This escape method might not work and it was too dangerous. He might as well think of a way out himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had some ideas about the treasure calabash. After being fed so many pills, the treasure calabash had become much lighter. Just because Liu Yun couldn’t lift it didn’t mean that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>If Liu Yun was still here, he didn’t think it was right to snatch it in front of him. However, he couldn’t be blamed if Liu Yun had already given up and left.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, don’t tell me you still have your sights on the treasure calabash?” Liu Yun clearly knew Zhou Wen too well and immediately saw through his thoughts. He curled his lips and continued, “I advise you to leave quickly. I don’t want you dying before you can enjoy your spoils.”</p>
<p>“You should mind your own business,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Leave quickly. It will be too late if we delay any further. We have to rush down the moment the two of them rush forward.” Jing Daoxian shouted again from outside. From his voice, one could tell that the situation wasn’t optimistic. “Junior Brother, good luck to you.” Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t delay any further. He gritted his teeth and rushed out the door, approaching Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>Seeing him leave, Zhou Wen turned around and instant transmitted to the calabash. He hugged the calabash with both hands, hoping to see if he could lift it up a little.</p>
<p>As long as he could lift it up by even a millimeter, he could put it into the chaos space and take it away. That was impossible if he couldn’t lift it up at all.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen hugged the calabash with both hands and exerted strength, he nearly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>He easily picked up the stone calabash which required no effort-it felt as light as a bubble.</p>
<p>Strange, how did it become so light? It’s like a bubble? Could it be that Liu Yun was too unlucky and the pills he fed only took effect after he left? Zhou Wen guessed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly rejected this thought. The stone calabash’s weight was only reducing slowly. It was impossible for it to become so light all of a sudden.</p>
<p>It’s not that Liu Yun’s luck is bad, nor is it a problem with the pills. Could it be because… Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he placed the stone calabash into the chaos space before reaching out to take the stone wheel below.</p>
<p>Legend had it that it was a millstone that Taishang Laojun had used to grind medicine. Humans called it the Luck Stone. In fact, the millstone might be even more precious than a calabash.</p>
<p>The treasure calabash was only used to store medicine, but the millstone could automatically grind the medicine. The two had very different functions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s fingers touched the millstone before he tugged at it. The millstone was easily lifted by Zhou Wen, about the same as when he picked up the treasure calabash.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. He didn’t know why he could obtain the treasure calabash and millstone so easily.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1490'>Chapter 1490 Golden Qilin</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly remembered that he had already made an attempt back when he was brought up here by the giant bear. He couldn’t lift the calabash at all, much less the millstone below.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to see if he could pick up the calabash that had been fed numerous pills, but to his surprise, he easily picked up the millstone along with it.</p>
<p>Could it be because I ate that Golden Elixir Pill? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the millstone and calabash to become lighter for no reason.</p>
<p>The Golden Elixir Pill turned Zhou Wen to stone. After a baffling recovery, he seemed to be able to lift the millstone and calabash.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much because the terrifying explosions outside were approaching the main entrance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Liu Yun had closed the door when he left. Otherwise, the two terrifying dimensional creatures would have already rushed in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept paying attention to the situation outside. At the instant the two Terror creatures charged forward, Jing Daoxian pulled Liu Yun and charged down the stairs. The timing was perfect.</p>
<p>The two terrifying creatures rushed to the door as the two of them rushed down.</p>
<p>The giant bear roared and turned to chase after them.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw this scene, he knew that his previous worries were correct.</p>
<p>The giant bear’s intelligence wasn’t ordinary. Zhou Wen had previously turned into a stone statue thanks to his deceit. He didn’t believe that it would watch them escape.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen expected, the giant bear chased after them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Golden Qilin-like dimensional creature didn’t chase after them. It sized up the door of Laojun Platform and paced beside it a few times.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, This door is the door to Laojun Platform after all. That giant bear is an extremely terrifying existence. It’s fine if it can smash through the door, but it’s impossible for a random dimensional creature to smash through the door, right?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the Golden Qilin pounced forward and slammed the door with its sharp claws, causing it to rumble with a terrifying sound.</p>
<p>Golden light bloomed from the Golden Qilin’s body. Its golden body was as crystalline as glass. It seemed to be augmented by some divine power as it struck the door again and again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat flustered in the beginning, but after a few strikes, he realized that although the Golden Qilin’s power was an onslaught and Zhou Wen was far from its match, it couldn’t crack the door like the giant bear.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin struck crazily for a while, but it failed to damage the door at all. In the end, it had no choice but to stop.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s impossible for an existence like the giant bear to randomly appear. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He guessed that the Golden Qilin was very likely a Hell-level existence. Zhou Wen was indeed much weaker than it. If it rushed in, Zhou Wen would probably have a hard time fighting it. All he could do was think of a way to escape. Now that the Golden Qilin couldn’t enter, Zhou Wen had more choices. It was best if he waited for it to leave before thinking of a way to leave Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat worried if he could successfully walk down the 33 steps.</p>
<p>Previously, the giant bear had brought him up here. It probably wouldn’t be easy to go down</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly realized that the Golden Qilin was acting abnormally again. It walked to the door and didn’t strike it this time. Instead, it raised its front claw and tapped the door with a golden claw.</p>
<p>Oh no! Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically when he heard the Golden Qilin knock on the door.</p>
<p>The rhythm was identical to Jing Daoxian’s knocking. It was clearly the way to open the door to Laojun Platform</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, this fellow actually knows how to use such a method to open the door. How high is its intelligence? Zhou Wen was alarmed as the door slowly opened.</p>
<p>The extremely ferocious face, that resembled a tiger and lion but was neither one, immediately appeared in Zhou Wen’s eyes. He had heard it previously, but now that he saw it with his own eyes, he found it somewhat different. The ferocious gaze and domineering aura made him feel like it stood at the top of a food chain.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because it was beautiful, but because of its unparalleled power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword as he wore the Prisoned Dragon armor. At the same time, he circulated the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra.</p>
<p>Although the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Calamity Zone couldn’t kill and could only heal living beings, the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra could greatly improve Zhou Wen’s various qualities, making him comparable to a true Calamity-grade creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating as he stared down the Golden Qilin with his sword.</p>
<p>Laojun Platform was a small place, so there was definitely no place to hide. He could only lure the Golden Qilin in first. It would be best if he could kill it.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t kill it, he would find an opportunity to rush down Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>After the Golden Qilin opened the door, it didn’t immediately attack Zhou Wen. Instead, it slowly walked through the door and stared at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that it was about to launch an attack, but to his surprise, the fellow swung its tail and closed the door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart sank. This action proved that this fellow’s intelligence was extremely high. Furthermore, it was extremely sinister and vicious.</p>
<p>The place became an independent space the moment the door was closed. Zhou Wen couldn’t leave even with spatial instant transmission unless he opened the door first.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already memorized the method Jing Daoxian used to open the door, opening it required time. It wasn’t an easy task to open the door in front of such a terrifying creature.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin didn’t immediately attack Zhou Wen after closing the door. Its body shook as golden light bloomed from its body. A golden glow instantly enveloped the entire</p>
<p>yard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gathered his strength to resist the golden light, but when the golden light touched Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, it didn’t cause any damage. However, the golden light was distorted by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, forming a golden halo around Zhou Wen. It failed to illuminate him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that the golden light was likely the domain of the Golden Qilin, but he didn’t know what use it had. It didn’t look like an offensive domain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt even warier towards such kinds of domains.</p>
<p>He could tell what kind of power an offensive domain had at a glance, but he couldn’t figure out the effects of such a domain. He might end up screwing up somehow.</p>
<p>The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener were already in place to prevent him from being affected by some unknown force.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin walked over step by step amidst the golden light. Its eyes seemed to condense into something corporeal. It was ferocious and domineering. If it were anyone with a weaker mental fortitude, they would probably lose the battle of wits.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the Golden Qilin still didn’t choose to lunge forward. Instead, it approached step by step, hoping to force Zhou Wen into a corner, preventing him from escaping</p>
<p>This fellow is really sinister and terrifying! This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered such a dimensional creature. He knew that he couldn’t retreat, or the situation would only worsen.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen suddenly exerted strength with the hilt of his sword and pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1491'>Chapter 1491 Battling the Golden Qilin</h3>
<p>The terrifying sword aura that erupted from the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be ignored even by the Golden Qilin.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin’s sharp claws welcomed the Immortal Culling Sword with a dazzling golden light. Its speed was so fast that it was a blur in Zhou Wen’s vision. He almost couldn’t tell the true trajectory of the claws.</p>
<p>Clang! The Immortal Culling Sword collided with the claw beam with the former’s sword beam tearing apart. However, when the claw beam touched the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade, it was severed. Even the Golden Qilin’s blade-like nails were sliced apart by the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that his strength was much weaker than the Golden Qilin. The reason he could sever the claw beam’s nails was because of the Immortal Culling Sword’s sharpness.</p>
<p>With the Immortal Culling Sword in hand, Zhou Wen used the Heart Defying Sword Art. Coupled with the ability of The Disqualified, he slashed at the Golden Qilin, again and again, targeting each strike at its vital spots.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin seemed to realize the sharpness of the Immortal Culling Sword and didn’t clash with it head-on. Its figure moved like a phantom as it constantly moved around Zhou Wen, causing his attacks to miss.</p>
<p>Even though Zhou Wen used instant transmission, he couldn’t keep up with the Golden Qilin’s speed.</p>
<p>What puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Golden Qilin didn’t seem to attack with all its might. It seemed to be waiting for something.</p>
<p>What’s it waiting for? Zhou Wen was puzzled. He knew that he couldn’t delay any further. He had to finish off the Golden Qilin as soon as possible or escape Laojun Platform.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword slashed apart the golden beams as it delivered a barrage of attacks at the Golden Qilin. An ancient mirror appeared the instant the Golden Qilin dodged, Zhou Wen having predicted its next location.</p>
<p>The rainbow beam in the ancient mirror shone out and landed on the location of the Golden Qilin.</p>
<p>On the left was the Numinous Treasure Hall, and on the right was a wall. Although the Golden Qilin was very fast, Zhou Wen had predicted its location. It had to either resist the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light or the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>In its horror, the Golden Qilin twisted its body and jerked its body to duck the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. However, the Immortal Culling Sword had already arrived above its head.</p>
<p>At the instant the Immortal Culling Sword slashed down, Zhou Wen felt a strong sense of unease.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin headbutted the Immortal Culling Sword, its golden horn colliding and sending it backward.</p>
<p>The Immortal Culling Sword failed to slice through its golden horn. Instead, Zhou Wen involuntarily retreated due to the powerful impact. The Immortal Culling Sword nearly flew out of his hand.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin’s eyes were ferocious as it shot out golden beams that struck Zhou Wen’s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already lost his balance from the powerful shockwaves. At that close distance, he was unable to control his body to quickly duck.</p>
<p>How sinister! Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin clearly had a long-range attack, but it pretended to be a melee creature while fighting Zhou Wen. It could clearly block the Immortal Culling Sword, but it pretended that it couldn’t fight him head-on.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered such a wretched and sinister dimensional creature with such powerful strength.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already realized that something was amiss. As the Immortal Culling Sword slashed down, he used Spacetime Bandit and instant transmission.</p>
<p>Due to Spacetime Bandit, instant transmission only took effect now. Zhou Wen instant transmitted and when he arrived beside the God of Fortune Hall, the Golden Qilin’s golden beam immediately missed and struck the wall of the Numinous Treasure Hall.</p>
<p>The golden light on the wall of the Numinous Treasure Hall exploded, producing a shockwave that sent the distant Zhou Wen retreating. If he was struck head-on, the outcome was obvious.</p>
<p>When the Golden Qilin saw its attack miss, it didn’t conceal its strength any further. It unleashed its explosive speed as the golden beam in its eyes constantly swept at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Combining his movement techniques and instant transmission, Zhou Wen dodged the golden beam as he found an opportunity to approach it. He wanted to use the Immortal Culling Sword to kill it.</p>
<p>However, the golden horn on its head was abnormally hard. It blocked several of the Immortal Culling Sword’s strikes. He only left some shallow marks on the golden horn, so it probably wouldn’t be easy to sever it.</p>
<p>The man and beast fought crazily on Laojun Platform. The Soul Mirror occasionally shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, but it was difficult to hit the Golden Qilin.</p>
<p>Before long, Zhou Wen sensed something amiss. He didn’t know what effect the Golden Qilin’s domain had, nor did he discover any effects the golden light had on him during the battle.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, Zhou Wen finally discovered the effects of the golden light. Furthermore, he realized that he was in danger.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the radiance was intensifying wherever the golden light shone, gradually condensing into something corporeal.</p>
<p>Moving in the golden light felt like he was moving in water. The resistance increasingly became immense. Zhou Wen suspected that he would be trapped in the golden light and unable to move to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Damn it! Zhou Wen knew that he was in big trouble.</p>
<p>This domain power was similar to a type of control or imprisonment, but this power didn’t directly affect him. Instead, it filled the nearby space. Therefore, Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were useless.</p>
<p>What should I do? Zhou Wen could already sense the pressure the golden light gave him.</p>
<p>Even if he used the Immortal Culling Sword to slash at the golden light, it was only like a blade slicing through water. He couldn’t truly sever it. After the Immortal Culling Sword slashed at it, the golden light would return to normal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it harder and harder to move. Finally, Zhou Wen failed to dodge in time. The golden light shot out from the Golden Qilin eyes struck his chest.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>At the instant Zhou Wen’s chest was struck, the Soul Mirror appeared. The golden beam shot into the mirror and was reflected back, landing on the Golden Qilin itself.</p>
<p>The golden light sliced through its golden scales. The Golden Qilin roared in pain as blood gushed out from its wound.</p>
<p>Immortal Slaying! Zhou Wen knew that this was his last chance. It was very difficult for the same tricks to be effective on the Golden Qilin again. Whether he could escape alive after this strike was a question.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin roared in pain as its neck was completely exposed in front of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen instantly slashed at its neck with the Immortal Culling Sword.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to hit its neck, the Golden Qilin suddenly lowered its head and bit the Immortal Culling Sword. At the same time, it lowered its head and slammed into Zhou Wen’s body with its golden horn.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The ring on Zhou Wen’s other hand flicked out and transformed into the Bamboo Blade. Zhou Wen drew his saber and stabbed forward, meeting the eye of the Golden Qilin that came falling right onto it.</p>
<p>Blood gushed out as the Bamboo Blade tore through its eye. The Golden Qilin shook its head crazily and sent Zhou Wen flying with the saber.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the wall of the main hall. The Prisoned Dragon armor on his body caved in, but the wall remained undamaged.</p>
<p>Roar! The Golden Qilin’s eye bled as it stared at Zhou Wen with its other eye and roared angrily.</p>
<p>With its roar, the surrounding golden light instantly froze. It was like a golden jelly that trapped Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1492'>Chapter 1492 Unimaginable Power</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though his body had sunk into solidified concrete. It was impossible to budge an inch.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin walked over step by step amidst the golden light. Its eye, which had been stabbed by Zhou Wen, remained bleeding. It bared its teeth with its mouth agape as though it wanted to eat Zhou Wen whole.</p>
<p>It’s over! Zhou Wen wanted to use instant transmission, but the entire Laojun Platform was filled with the frozen radiance. There was no space for him to carry out instant transmission. All he could do was watch helplessly as the Golden Qilin gradually approached.</p>
<p>Even the Soul Mirror was frozen in midair. It could only emit divine light in one direction, but that meant that it was already useless.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling despair, he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from his pocket.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he realized that it likely came from the mysterious phone. However, he didn’t know why it was making such a strange sound.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew what happened next because the two Golden Wyrms that were giving birth returned to him.</p>
<p>Without any time to think, the Golden Qilin opened its mouth and bit down at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>If it had managed to bite him, Zhou Wen’s head would probably have said goodbye to his body.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the two Golden Wyrms and transformed them into shears.</p>
<p>At the instant the Golden Qilin’s mouth bit down, the two Golden Wyrm Shears pierced through the frozen golden light and reached straight into its mouth. Then, they sliced down like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw blood spew out of the Golden Qilin’s mouth as golden blood splattered all over his face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that the pair of Golden Wyrm Shears were crazily wrecking the Golden Qilin’s stomach, grinding its organs into a mess.</p>
<p>Haha, the heavens are really helping me to have the Golden Wyrms appear at this moment! Zhou Wen knew that he had to thank his good luck.</p>
<p>Any later and Zhou Wen would have died. If the Golden Wyrms had appeared earlier, they might not have had the chance to rush into the Golden Qilin’s stomach.</p>
<p>Although the Golden Wyrms were also at the Calamity grade and were sharp enough, they were only at the Human Realm. If they hadn’t entered the Golden Qilin’s stomach by chance, they might not have been able to severely injure it.</p>
<p>The pair of Golden Wyrm Shears twisted crazily in the Golden Qilin’s stomach. It cried out tragically as it rolled on the ground, blood spewing out from its mouth like a fountain.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin attempted to lunge at Zhou Wen a few times amidst its struggling, but it ultimately collapsed due to the excruciating pain.</p>
<p>Kill it… Kill it… Zhou Wen was still trapped in the frozen golden light and couldn’t move. All he could do was secretly cheer the two Golden Wyrms on.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Qilin was about to die, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a dangerous aura.</p>
<p>The Golden Qilin’s entire body emitted a golden glow as its body turned into a golden crystal. One could clearly see the pair of Golden Wyrm shears that were entangled inside.</p>
<p>That didn’t matter. What mattered was that the Golden Qilin’s ferocious face was filled with determination. Its transparent body resembled a golden crystal and had a strange energy surge as though it would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>It’s self-destructing! Zhou Wen was alarmed. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.</p>
<p>The solidified golden light bloomed with the Golden Qilin, emitting extremely terrifying energy. It was about to self-destruct with the Golden Qilin.</p>
<p>The terrifying energy fluctuations were enough to make Zhou Wen realize that even the Prisoned Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense couldn’t withstand the might of the self-destruction.</p>
<p>The might produced by the self-destruction of a Hell-level creature far exceeded the limits of Zhou Wen’s tolerance.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Splat!</p>
<p>A huge palm descended from the sky, instantly shattering the frozen golden light like glass as the fragments fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body fell as well. He watched helplessly as the huge palm struck down at the Golden Qilin that was about to self-destruct.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Golden Wyrms instantly returned to Zhou Wen before he heard a clap. The Golden Qilin that had gathered terrifying power was slapped to the ground. Its body was pressed down by the huge palm as though it had been flattened. Pfft!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard a sound similar to firecrackers coming from beneath the palm. After the crisp sound, there was silence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the furry palm and saw the giant bear’s head extend in from the periphery wall. Its two front paws were already inside the wall, and the back half of its body was still outside.</p>
<p>As for the baby bear, it was lying on the giant bear’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The giant bear raised the flattened Golden Qilin’s claw. The tiles beneath the claw had shattered as though something had exploded. The Golden Qilin’s body had already vanished, leaving only a golden horn in the rubble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was horrified. How terrifying was the Golden Qilin? It was very likely a Hell-level existence, but the power of its self-destruction was suppressed by the giant bear’s claw. It was unimaginable what kind of power it had.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t even defeat the Golden Qilin. Now that he was targeted by the giant bear, he naturally didn’t feel any joy from escaping death.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The giant bear climbed over the wall and walked in. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the giant bear didn’t need to enter through the door. It could directly climb over the wall.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as simple as flipping over a wall. If it was really just a wall, Zhou Wen could fly over it no matter how high it was.</p>
<p>However, Laojun Platform’s yard was an independent space. It was also protected by Laojun Platform’s rules. To be able to gain forceful entry not only required the ability to tear through space, but also the ability to clash head-on with Laojun Platform’s rules.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was temporarily unable to estimate how much of this terrifying power was needed.</p>
<p>He watched the giant bear flip into the yard. Although he knew that it was useless, he subconsciously retreated. Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, but he couldn’t think of a way to save his life at the giant bear’s paws.</p>
<p>After the giant bear entered the yard, its body became much smaller. It wasn’t as huge as before.</p>
<p>The baby bear got off its back and ran towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed but delighted. Many thoughts flashed through his mind. Can I use this baby bear as a hostage? But do bears know what a hostage is? Will it be threatened?</p>
<p>The baby bear reached Zhou Wen amid his dilemma. It circled him a few times as though it was taking in his scent.</p>
<p>After circling a few times, the baby bear seemed to confirm something as it pounced on Zhou Wen and licked his face. It looked extremely affectionate.</p>
<p>Does this fellow still recognize me? Zhou Wen’s expression changed. He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1493'>Chapter 1493 Appearance of the Daytime Stars</h3>
<p>The baby bear pounced at Zhou Wen who didn’t dare move. He spread open his arms, afraid to touch the baby bear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was afraid that if he reached out to touch the baby bear, the giant bear would mistake him for trying to harm the baby bear. The outcome would definitely be tragic.</p>
<p>The baby bear seemed oblivious. It snuggled up to Zhou Wen as though it wanted to play with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the giant bear, unsure if he should move.</p>
<p>The giant bear moved its claw and swatted the horn on the ground, throwing it to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this? Is it for me?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. It felt like it, but he found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>The giant bear definitely knew about his transformation into the baby bear. It was already considered benevolent that it hadn’t smacked him to death. Zhou Wen didn’t find it likely that it would give him something left behind by the Golden Qilin.</p>
<p>The giant bear glanced at him and stood up. Zhou Wen jumped in fright and had the urge to turn around and escape, but he couldn’t escape Laojun Platform at all.</p>
<p>After the giant bear stood up, it moved its gaze away from Zhou Wen and looked up into the sky as though it was looking at the cosmos.</p>
<p>However, it was daytime. The sun was out, so what stars were there to speak of?</p>
<p>The giant bear kept looking up. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but look up. What he saw made his jaw drop.</p>
<p>Stars appeared one after another in the sky with the scorching sun. The light from the stars was equally visible during the day. Furthermore, they became brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen looked at the stars in the sky before looking at the giant bear.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the stars that appeared were definitely related to the giant bear. This was because Zhou Wen had already seen starlight land on it.</p>
<p>Starlight from the clear, blue sky shone on the giant bear like searchlights. Even an idiot knew that this matter was definitely related to the giant bear.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Many people in the Federation saw the star-filled sky that day, but they didn’t know the reason for it.</p>
<p>All the major factions were paying attention to this strange phenomenon. The media likewise reported about it.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what was happening outside, he could imagine that with such a strange phenomenon happening, the Federation would definitely be in chaos.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that this was only the beginning. The chaos outside far exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>This was because the Cubes that were scattered across the world lit up at the same time.</p>
<p>After the Venusian battle, the Cubes had been dormant. Now that they were activated again, the scene on the Cubes was none other than the daytime stars.</p>
<p>The Cube has started up again. I wonder if it’s a blessing or a curse? Zhang Chunqiu sighed softly. Too many things had happened recently for him. He felt like he was treading on thin ice as he led the Zhang family through the complex situation, afraid that he would steer the Zhang family into a bottomless abyss if he wasn’t careful.</p>
<p>Is it starting again? Which planet’s Companion Beast is it this time? Xia Liuchuan looked eager.</p>
<p>Ever since Xia Jiuhuang died, the Xia family had kept a low profile and secretly developed, constantly strengthening themselves. Now, they had already recovered quite a bit, but to return to the Xia family’s peak needed more resources and hard work. The battle of the Cube was undoubtedly the fastest way to obtain top-notch resources.</p>
<p>“Strange, why are there so many stars shining? Which planet’s Companion Beast is next?” Dugu Ge muttered to himself as he watched the scene.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Dugu Ge. Everyone watching the Cube found it strange. This was because only Venus had appeared on the Cube during the last Venusian battle.</p>
<p>There were more than ten stars in this daytime phenomenon. These scenes were projected on the Cube, leaving people to guess what was happening.</p>
<p>Even Holy God in the Holy Land frowned as he looked at the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the starlight on the giant bear’s body intensified, as though it was about to ascend with the starlight. He couldn’t help but feel alarmed. What’s going on? Could it be that the giant bear isn’t a dimensional creature from Earth, but from the Universe? That’s not right either. Earth has its own rules of self-protection. Ignoring the creatures in the Universe, even the creatures on Earth are greatly restricted. For example, Tsukuyomi has no choice but to leave Earth. This giant bear’s level should be higher than Tsukuyomi’s. If it isn’t a creature from Earth, how can it not be restricted when it’s here?</p>
<p>Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he couldn’t figure out what was going on. If the giant bear was an Earthling, why was it able to trigger the stars in the universe? Furthermore, it wasn’t just one. Many stars seemed to be responding to it.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the baby bear seemed to realize something as it pounced over to throw itself into the giant bear’s arms.</p>
<p>However, the starlight isolated it outside like an invisible barrier, preventing it from approaching the giant bear.</p>
<p>The giant bear looked at the baby bear with a gentle gaze that had some emotions Zhou Wen couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Wu… Wu…” The baby bear cried out as it wanted to rush into the starlight. Its claws scratched at the starlight but to no avail.</p>
<p>The giant bear didn’t stop the baby bear or do anything. It only looked at it lovingly.</p>
<p>As the starlight intensified, the giant bear’s body gradually floated up thanks to the starlight’s attraction.</p>
<p>The giant bear is about to be forced to leave Earth? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>If the giant bear left just like that, he would be completely out of danger. However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If the giant bear left Earth, why didn’t it take the baby bear with it? With its powerful strength, it shouldn’t be difficult to leave with the baby bear.</p>
<p>The giant bear wasn’t surprised at all that the baby bear was blocked outside the starlight. Clearly, it was within the giant bear’s expectations.</p>
<p>The giant bear’s body rose higher and higher. The baby bear jumped and scratched anxiously, wanting to approach the giant bear, but it was blocked by the starlight. It couldn’t get an inch closer.</p>
<p>The giant bear had already risen above Laojun Platform. It suddenly retracted its gaze and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart subconsciously raced as it stared at him. Although its gaze wasn’t ferocious, it made him feel an inexplicable pressure.</p>
<p>“Wu… Wu…” The baby bear jumped up and slammed into the starlight, but it was stopped by Laojun Platform’s power. After falling, it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The giant bear’s body had already exceeded the range of Laojun Platform. Its speed of ascension became faster and faster.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could figure out why the giant bear was looking at him, the giant bear’s figure had already risen into the sky like a meteor. In a blink of an eye, it vanished into space.</p>
<p>The shiny stars also gradually dimmed as the giant bear ascended into the universe. The phenomenon of the daytime stars also vanished. Only the baby bear continued to whimper at the sky.</p>
<p>Although the phenomenon of the daytime stars vanished, the Cubes didn’t stop. The scene inside them was changing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1494'>Chapter 1494 Reopening of the Cube</h3>
<p>Finally, the Cube’s scene froze on a strange planet that emitted a strange glow. It was entirely orange-red, and there seemed to be a dazzling rainbow swirling inside.</p>
<p>Due to the intense light, one couldn’t see what was inside.</p>
<p>The Cube’s screen froze on this scene. It didn’t change or close.</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Some factions even began studying the planet that appeared on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up into the sky and couldn’t see the giant bear at all. The sky was blue.</p>
<p>The baby bear’s eyes were brimming with tears as it constantly cried towards the sky. Seeing Zhou Wen look at it, the baby bear pounced over and burrowed its head into Zhou Wen’s arms as it hugged him and wailed.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was still in a daze.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the giant bear meant for him to adopt the baby bear.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t understand why the giant bear believed that he would adopt the baby bear and not kill it.</p>
<p>Since the giant bear had already left Earth, it was unlikely it would return. Even if he killed the baby bear, the giant bear couldn’t do anything to him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen really couldn’t bring himself to kill it when he saw the crying baby bear.</p>
<p>Could it be that the giant bear’s intelligence has already reached such a stage that it can tell that I won’t attack the baby bear? Zhou Wen patted the baby bear’s head. He still felt that something was amiss, but he couldn’t pinpoint it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the baby bear was easy to coax. It stopped crying after a while.</p>
<p>“I have to leave. Are you coming with me?” Zhou Wen asked the baby bear.</p>
<p>The baby bear looked at him in puzzlement. Clearly, it didn’t understand what Zhou Wen was saying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gestured and talked for some time, but he failed to make the baby bear understand him. However, when Zhou Wen walked out, the baby bear followed him.</p>
<p>This fellow is so stupid. If I leave it here alone, it probably won’t survive. Forget it. I’ll take it back. Zhou Wen put away the golden horn and left Laojun Platform with the baby bear.</p>
<p>When he stepped onto the 33rd step, Zhou Wen immediately felt that it was different from before. With a single step, the world changed as though he had stepped into a void. He felt his body rapidly plummet towards an unknown destination.</p>
<p>Strangely, the baby bear didn’t fall into the void with Zhou Wen. He didn’t even see its shadow.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen circulated the Dao Sutra and engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen realized that he was still standing on the steps. There was no void, nor was he falling. The baby bear was beside him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked down with the baby bear. With the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the 33 steps had nothing against him. The baby bear didn’t seem to be restricted by the Dao steps as it followed Zhou Wen and kept leaning its head towards him.</p>
<p>After leaving Laojun Platform, Zhou Wen circled Mingdao Palace. There were many dimensional creatures here, but they didn’t attack humans. Clearly, they were affected by Mingdao Palace’s nomological forces. They weren’t as fearless as the Golden Qilin and the giant bear.</p>
<p>With the giant bear gone and the Golden Qilin dead, I can consider using this place to build a human city. However, killing inside Laojun Platform is prohibited. Food in the future will be a problem. Furthermore, any creature can enter and exit Laojun Platform as they please. If another creature like the giant bear appears, it will be a huge problem. Zhou Wen thought it through and felt that Laojun Platform could be used as a temporary refuge.</p>
<p>However, permanently using it to build a human city for residence didn’t seem like a good choice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that his Dao Sutra might be able to rely on Laojun Platform to advance to the Calamity grade. When that happened, wouldn’t the human city built here be very dangerous if Laojun Platform was destroyed?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t find anything on Laojun Platform that could advance the Dao Sutra to the Calamity grade. All he could do was return to take a check on the situation.</p>
<p>The baby bear followed Zhou Wen closely. It would panic if it lost sight of him. It looked like the giant bear’s departure had left a huge psychological trauma on it.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be afraid. You will have many friends soon.” Zhou Wen stroked the baby bear’s head and returned to Guide City with it.</p>
<p>Guide City’s situation wasn’t bad. In the past few days when Zhou Wen was at Laojun Platform, there had been a few large-scale attacks by the skeleton legions.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai was originally very worried, but to his surprise, with Chick spitting out a mouthful of flames, the skeleton legion was like dried pieces of wood. The flames spread across a large area.</p>
<p>The skeleton legion was nothing in front of Chick. It left Yu Qiubai pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chick showcasing its prowess, those who were still hesitant quickly gathered towards the school. Many people even signed an agreement and were willing to become a part of the new city.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, this bird of yours is amazing. People outside treat it as a divine bird and say that it’s the legendary Mystic Bird.” Yu Qiubai excitedly recounted how Chick had unleashed its might and how much it had been worshiped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry when he heard that. It was true that the Mystic Bird was the Shang dynasty’s divine bird, but it was supposed to be a black bird.</p>
<p>Chick was a phoenix, and its body was already pale golden. It didn’t look like a Mystic Bird no matter how one looked at it.</p>
<p>However, Chick was very pleased with itself. As Yu Qiubai recounted its heroic deeds, it raised its chin to the sky as though it was invincible.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Only then did Yu Qiubai see the baby bear behind Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The baby bear was actually very timid. It had been hiding behind Zhou Wen the entire time. Occasionally, it would extend half its head to peek at Yu Qiubai and Chick.</p>
<p>The reason Yu Qiubai asked was that the baby bear didn’t look like a bear. Its body was different from that of the giant bear, and it was closer to a four-foot beast that resembled a lion or tiger.</p>
<p>“This is a pet I adopted. It’s rather feral and isn’t as obedient as Chick. Don’t approach it,” Zhou Wen exhorted Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai nodded and asked, “How’s the situation at Laojun Platform?”</p>
<p>“That dimensional creature has been resolved, but I don’t think Laojun Platform is suitable for building a human city. Although it’s temporarily safe there, we can’t kill in there. This means that we need to obtain food from the outside world. Furthermore, any creature in Mingdao Palace can enter freely. This is very disadvantageous for us,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai sighed and said, “I also know that it’s not a suitable place, but there are so many people counting on us. They need a stable home.”</p>
<p>“With Chick guarding this place, there shouldn’t be any problems for the time being. We still have time. Let’s think about it again and see if there are any suitable dimensional zones.” Zhou Wen still felt that he shouldn’t choose Laojun Platform and Mingdao Palace just for a moment of peace.</p>
<p>“Let me think about it again.” Yu Qiubai paused before suddenly saying, “By the way, do you know about the Cube’s reopening?”</p>
<p>“Is there a Cube here?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1495'>Chapter 1495 Discovery Under the Cube</h3>
<p>There were many places where the Cube appeared. Most of them were places where large numbers of humans gathered. There were also some ancient cities or dimensional zones that might have the Cubes appear.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it surprising that Guide Ancient City had a Cube, but with the city’s continuous outflow of population, it surprised him that the Cube would appear outside a dimensional zone. “We also found it odd in the past. I’ve also read reports about the Cube. The Cubes in other cities appear in the center of cities where humans gather. However, even back then, Guide City’s Cube was located in the suburbs. There weren’t many people there, nor were there any dimensional zones. There’s no one there now. I wonder why the Cube appeared there,” Yu Qiubai said.</p>
<p>“Where is it?” Zhou Wen felt that the location of the Cube definitely wasn’t for no reason. Perhaps there was something there that hadn’t been discovered.</p>
<p>Yu Qiubai took out a map and gave Zhou Wen directions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t far from Ancient City. It used to be the suburbs of Guide City, a place where crops were planted.</p>
<p>It was once a place where lots of wheat was planted, but it had long been abandoned. There were weeds everywhere, almost as tall as a person.</p>
<p>This place didn’t have any dimensional zones. It looked like a barren land.</p>
<p>A huge Cube stood in the middle of the weeds. From afar, one could see the lit Cube’s screen. On it was the shimmering orange-red planet.</p>
<p>This should be a star, right? Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and was roughly certain that it was a star that resembled the sun, not a planet like Earth.</p>
<p>Stars emitted a large amount of light and heat. It was almost impossible for creatures to survive on it.</p>
<p>The sun had a surface temperature that could reach 5,500°C. Its interior temperature was higher beyond imagination. Even a Calamity-grade creature couldn’t withstand the high temperature inside.</p>
<p>If the dimensional zone is on that planet, the dimensional zone this time will probably be much more difficult than Venus. Zhou Wen was roughly certain that it wasn’t the sun, so he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t a planet in the Solar System, the impact on Earth would be much smaller.</p>
<p>The scene on the Cube didn’t move, nor was there anything interesting to watch. Zhou Wen circled the Cube and used Truth Listener to scan the nearby area, hoping to figure out what was different about it.</p>
<p>Strange, there aren’t any special Essence Energy fluctuations here, nor are there any dimensional zones. However, this isn’t a place where humans gather. Why would the Cube be here? Zhou Wen plucked some weeds and carefully observed them.</p>
<p>Although the weeds here had mutated due to the environment, they didn’t exceed the normal range of mutation. They hadn’t evolved into dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Such mutations were everywhere in the world. There was nothing special about them.</p>
<p>There must be a reason for the Cube’s appearance here. Unfortunately, the Earth Elemental Beast has already been killed by Perfect Sword Immortal. Otherwise, I might discover something if I let the Earth Elemental Beast venture deep underground. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth who was also good at digging.</p>
<p>After Tyrant Behemoth came out, it followed Zhou Wen’s order and lowered its head to burrow into the ground. The strange horn on its head spun like a drill, drilling a huge hole through the weeds.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth failed to discover any underground dimensional zones despite burrowing a few hundred meters. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, he saw the baby bear run to a grass patch near the Cube. It crouched down and dug something with its front paws.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked over curiously and saw the baby bear’s front paws quickly dig open a huge hole. “What’s that?” Zhou Wen realized that the baby bear had really dug out something.</p>
<p>He still couldn’t tell what it was. It looked yellowish-brown with some fine patterns on it. It wasn’t gold, jade, or stone.</p>
<p>The baby bear’s actions became very gentle. It used its paws to remove the soil on it, allowing the thing to gradually appear. Eh… This is… a hive… Zhou Wen finally saw what it was.</p>
<p>It was a hive resembling a lotus with a diameter of more than fifty centimeters. The baby bear tore open the hive with its paws, and honey flowed out.</p>
<p>The baby bear licked the honey and sucked quite a bit. It even gestured for Zhou Wen to eat the honey with it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dabbed a little with his finger and tasted it. It was really sweet honey.</p>
<p>Strange, this hive should be on a tree. The hive of the Scoliidae isn’t like that. Why would this hive appear underground? Zhou Wen called Tyrant Behemoth over and got it to continue digging in the pit dug by the baby</p>
<p>bear.</p>
<p>The baby bear made another discovery after a short dig. However, this time, it wasn’t a hive, but some rotting bronze tools.</p>
<p>As most of them had already rotted, from the remnant parts, they were likely something similar to a tripod cauldron.</p>
<p>Tyrant Behemoth damaged many bronze tools while digging due to its potent strength, making it even more difficult for Zhou Wen to identify them. Therefore, Zhou Wen decided not to let it dig any further and dug with his hands.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen dug out some gray pottery and some jade-like decorations. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what the decorations were for, he could tell from the jade’s texture that they were very inferior jade. These things look like antiques, but antiques aren’t of much value to this era. Zhou Wen’s understanding of history was limited. He didn’t know what era these things came from, so he guessed that they were likely from the Shang dynasty.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued digging and dug out some strange items. Most of them were gray pottery and bronze. Although there were other things, most of them had rotted due to the passage of time.</p>
<p>As he dug, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up. Beneath his fingers, a hard object appeared. It looked like jade, but upon careful inspection, he realized that it was actually bone.</p>
<p>What creature do these bones belong to? Zhou Wen slowly wiped the soil from the bones. Soon, he realized that the bones were connected. They didn’t look like ordinary bones. Bones would scatter after the flesh rotted.</p>
<p>The bones beneath were connected, but the flesh was long gone. For some reason, the bones hadn’t split apart. They had remained firmly stuck together.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen dug out the entire skeleton, he realized that it was the skeleton of a giant bird. Furthermore, it was complete without any missing bones.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1496'>Chapter 1496 Giant Bird Skeleton</h3>
<p>The skeleton was almost fossilized. Some spots still maintained a bony luster like crystalline jade, but some places were already as dim as fossils. There were also many potholes.</p>
<p>From the skeleton, the bird was probably four to five meters tall when upright. There had never been such a huge bird in history.</p>
<p>Which era had such a huge bird? Zhou Wen suspected that it was the legendary Mystic Bird.</p>
<p>After all, no one had seen such a huge bird. It was normal to treat such a huge bird as a divine bird.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were only bird bones left. There were no feathers, so it was unknown if its feathers were black.</p>
<p>He didn’t discover any Essence Energy fluctuations from the bird bones. It was like an ordinary skeleton. Zhou Wen placed it to the side and continued digging.</p>
<p>He dug out some gray pottery shards and even discovered some stone tools. They were stone tools that resembled sabers and axes. They were very crude.</p>
<p>If he saw these stone tools by the side of the road, Zhou Wen would definitely think that they were just ordinary but strangely-shaped rocks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had dug up all the places nearby. Apart from the damaged relics, only the bird bones were interesting.</p>
<p>He was somewhat disappointed that he hadn’t found a dimensional zone or a mysterious item.</p>
<p>Turning his head, Zhou Wen wanted to tidy up the derelict items he had dug out and store them in the chaos space. Although they were useless to him, they were likely irreplaceable treasures to historians.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on putting them away. After Earth truly became peaceful in the future, these things might become priceless treasures.</p>
<p>Eh! Zhou Wen came in front of the pile of junk and couldn’t help but frown after taking a look.</p>
<p>He had dug out quite a number of things and piled them up like a small hill. However, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the pile of junk was much smaller than before.</p>
<p>In order to confirm that he hadn’t remembered wrongly, Zhou Wen went through the derelict items one by one and placed them elsewhere.</p>
<p>There’s indeed a significant decrease. The bronze artifact that looks like a radish is gone. Many gray pottery items and tools are also gone. As many of the tools were strange in shape, Zhou Wen didn’t know what they were, so he had a deep impression of them. He couldn’t find them no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Looking around, he didn’t find any traces of dimensional creatures or humans.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used Great Brahma to observe the particles in the air, but he didn’t discover any particles left behind by other lifeforms on them.</p>
<p>What the hell? Did those things grow legs and run? Zhou Wen combed through the pile again, hoping to confirm that he hadn’t remembered wrongly.</p>
<p>He realized that there were even fewer things than before after a second count. The few things he had just held were gone.</p>
<p>What the hell! Zhou Wen looked around warily, imagining that a terrifying existence had sneaked over.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for quite some time, he didn’t discover anything. Truth Listener didn’t find any traces.</p>
<p>If that thing can really prevent me from sensing it at such a close distance while secretly removing the items, plucking out my head wouldn’t be a problem. There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Zhou Wen thought carefully and felt that something was amiss. He decided to count again.</p>
<p>Something was missing again this time. Zhou Wen couldn’t work out how so many things were going missing under his nose.</p>
<p>He summoned his Companion Beasts and got them to guard his surroundings while he paid close attention to the pile of junk.</p>
<p>The baby bear had been licking the honey the entire time. Having just finished its meal, it crawled back to Zhou Wen’s side and looked curiously at the derelict items on the ground.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, nothing happened. Even the Soul Mirror and the two Golden Wyrms didn’t react.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept staring at the pile of junk, but he didn’t discover anything missing</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t discover any stirrings or anything missing after some time. He counted the derelict items again, but he realized that a few more items were missing.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, what the hell? How did this decrease? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded as he searched the ground, but he still didn’t find anything</p>
<p>With a thought, he summoned a large group of Musical Note Sprites. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, the Musical Note Sprites attached themselves to the derelict items.</p>
<p>Every bronze artifact, every gray pottery, and even the fragments had a Musical Note Sprite attached to them. Zhou Wen had to figure out how those things had vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he stared intently at the pile of items. At the same time, he used his connection with the Musical Notes to monitor all the junk.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt one of the Musical Note Sprites vanish. Before he could carefully see what the vanished Musical Note Sprites was attached to, a few more lost contact with him. He couldn’t sense them no matter what.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly ordered the remaining Musical Note Sprites to fly up with the items they were attached to before trying to search for the few Musical Note Sprites he had lost contact with.</p>
<p>He didn’t find the missing Musical Note Sprites, but he realized that everything else was flying together with the rest of the Musical Note Sprites. Only the skeleton of the giant bird remained on the ground.</p>
<p>Could it be that the missing item has something to do with it? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the skeleton and realized that the Musical Note Sprite that had been attached to it had vanished.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the Musical Note Sprites wasn’t a problem, but the few Musical Note Sprites that were attached to the items had gone missing at the same time. Only the Musical Note Sprite attached to this skeleton was gone, but the skeleton remained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned another Musical Note Sprite and got it to attach itself to the giant bird’s skeleton. Then, Zhou Wen kept staring at it.</p>
<p>After a while, something strange happened. The Musical Note Sprite on the giant bird’s skeleton vanished into thin air. It happened without warning, nor were there any spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Zhou Wen widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>On a careful recall, he realized that the things that had gone missing previously were beside the giant bird’s skeleton.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen placed a few pieces of bronze and gray pottery on the giant bird’s bones. After a while, the fragments magically vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched helplessly as they vanished, but he still didn’t know what kind of power made them vanish. It was as though they had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>There seems to be something wrong with this giant bird’s skeleton! Zhou Wen carefully sized up the giant bird’s skeleton, but he still didn’t discover anything different about it. However, after what had happened, Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe that it was just an ordinary bird’s skeleton.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1497'>Chapter 1497 Star Chart</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen experimented a few more times and was certain that anything that came into contact with the giant bird’s skeleton would vanish into thin air.</p>
<p>Strangely, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could understand if it was a spatial teleportation power, but it was somewhat strange that the items vanished without any spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen still didn’t know where the missing items had gone.</p>
<p>If they had disintegrated, there should have been remnants, but Zhou Wen didn’t even see the remaining particles after the disintegration.</p>
<p>If it was teleportation, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure what had happened to the Companion Beasts after they vanished due to the loss in connection. He naturally didn’t know where they had been teleported to.</p>
<p>Unable to figure it out, Zhou Wen had no choice but to bury the giant bird skeleton again.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare place it into the chaos space. It would be a huge loss if he lost the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, anything that touched the giant bird skeleton would vanish, but the soil here didn’t.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got some soil from elsewhere and placed it on the giant bird’s skeleton. After a while, it vanished.</p>
<p>This place is indeed not ordinary. Zhou Wen dug some nearby areas and discovered many gray pottery and bronze items, but they were only ordinary antiques and weren’t of much value.</p>
<p>The various factions were studying the celestial bodies that had recently appeared on the Cube. Some factions had already attempted to send people over, but they only sent suicide warriors or death row convicts.</p>
<p>They wanted to figure out what kind of dimensional zone existed on the celestial body.</p>
<p>Strangely, after the various factions made their attempts, they realized that the Cube could be activated, but they couldn’t teleport people over.</p>
<p>This happened until someone dripped the blood of four people on the Cube. Amidst the Cube’s brilliance, the four of them vanished together.</p>
<p>However, the Cube’s screen only shook for a moment before returning to normal. It was as though nothing had happened. It was unknown if the four of them were still alive.</p>
<p>Before long, many factions discovered this phenomenon. Only four people could activate the Cube together—no more, no less.</p>
<p>However, the people who were teleported were considered to die an instant death. There was no news from them. The Cube’s screen only shook for a moment before it fell silent.</p>
<p>“The temperature on that celestial body is too high. Ordinary humans can’t withstand it. It’s useless even if we teleport over.” A Censor briefed Wei Ge in the bureau.</p>
<p>The Censors had done the most experiments. A large number of prisoners had already died.</p>
<p>Wei Ge didn’t look up as he continued reading the information in his hand. It was a star chart, but it wasn’t a modern star chart. It was a star chart used in ancient times to distinguish celestial bodies.</p>
<p>“End the experiments. Don’t touch the Cube for the time being,” Wei Ge said to the Censor as he looked at the star chart.</p>
<p>“Yes, Director-General,” the Censor answered. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Director-General, everyone is looking to us for more information. The League of Guardians is pressing us the most. How do we reply?”</p>
<p>Wei Ge placed the star chart in his hand on the table and pushed it in front of the Censor. He said indifferently, “Make a few copies of this star chart. If anyone comes to ask for more information, give them this start chart once they pay the price.”</p>
<p>“Will that work?” The Censor picked up the star chart and looked at Wei Ge in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Although this star chart was an ancient copy, it wasn’t too rare. It wouldn’t be difficult to obtain it.</p>
<p>“Go.” Wei Ge didn’t explain and got him to do the job.</p>
<p>After the Censor left, Wei Ge held his chin with his hand and thought for a moment. As though he had thought of something interesting, he picked up his phone and edited a picture of the star chart he had taken. He clicked on a friend and sent it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying the giant bird skeleton when he suddenly heard his phone ring. He took it out and realized that it was a message from Wei Ge.</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this? Zhou Wen opened the message and took a look. He realized that it was a very crude star chart. The stars labeled on it weren’t as detailed as modern-day star charts. Furthermore, there weren’t any labels for the stars’ names.</p>
<p>However, on the star chart, a star was circled in red.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the star chart and compared it to his Singularity Universe, but he failed to tell which area of the cosmos these stars belonged to.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen’s Singularity Universe was very detailed, and this star chart had too many missing stars, it was difficult to make a comparison.</p>
<p>“Is this star the celestial body on the Cube’s screen?” Zhou Wen sent a message to Wei Ge.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Wei Ge replied succinctly. “What’s the name of this celestial body?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue sending messages. “Think about it yourself.” Wei Ge was even more straightforward this time.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it simpler if you tell me?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.</p>
<p>“I like seeing your thirst for knowledge without getting it. How about this? Beg me and I’ll show some kindness and tell you.” After Wei Ge sent the message, the corners of his mouth curled up smugly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen closed the chat window the moment he read Wei Ge’s message.</p>
<p>“What a joke. I have so many teachers here. I don’t believe they can’t recognize a single star chart.” Zhou Wen took the star chart to Yu Qiubai.</p>
<p>After Yu Qiubai took a look at the star chart, he glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “Little Wen, while cultivating, you still have to take some time to gain some cultural knowledge. This star chart is a division of the Arctic Sky in ancient times. The star that’s circled in red is the first star of the Big Dipper. It’s called Dubhe and also known as the Ravenous Wolf.”</p>
<p>This is the Big Dipper? Zhou Wen looked at the star chart again and realized that with Dubhe as the starting point, it indeed connected to six other stars in the shape of a ladle. He couldn’t help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s not your fault. The star charts that were drawn by the ancients naturally aren’t as detailed as they are now. However, a celestial body as obvious as the Big Dipper should be recognized.” Yu Qiubai asked curiously, “Why are you suddenly interested in the star chart?”</p>
<p>The celestial body on the Cube is very likely Dubhe. Zhou Wen checked the information on the Big Dipper on the Internet and suddenly discovered something very magical.</p>
<p>The Big Dipper was the brightest celestial body at the North Pole. This was the way the sky was divided in the East District during ancient times. And according to the division of the West District, the Big Dipper belonged to the Ursa Major constellation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the giant bear that had ascended to the cosmos from Laojun Platform. He thought to himself, Could that giant bear be related to this dimensional zone?</p>
<p>However, the constellations were from the West, while the giant bear was a dimensional creature from the East. Furthermore, it had ascended from Laojun Platform, so it just felt somewhat odd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1498'>Chapter 1498 Dubhe</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one who knew of this news, but to most people, it didn’t seem to matter whether the celestial body on the Cube was Dubhe or not.</p>
<p>“Charlatan, the rumors floating about point to that celestial body being Dubhe of the Big Dipper. What do you think?” Xia Liuchuan immediately called Zhang Chunqiu. The Zhang family was better at these things.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu said, “That’s Dubhe of the Big Dipper all right. However, I advise you not to have any ideas about it.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Xia Liuchuan asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“You should know that Dubhe is also called the Ravenous Wolf Star, right?” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“I do. Although I’m not as good at astronomical observation as you are, I’ve heard of Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Isn’t it synonymous with the Wisdom Star and the Auspicious Star?” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>“That’s because you don’t know much about Ravenous Wolf or what it entails. Dubhe is indeed auspicious, but under certain circumstances, the Ravenous Wolf is a very ominous sign. It’s best not to touch it before things are clear,” Zhang Chunqiu said solemnly. “For real?” Xia Liuchuan still didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“It’s up to you whether you believe it or not.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else and hung up.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that I doubt you. Why get so worked up?” Xia Liuchuan muttered and put down the phone.</p>
<p>Many people asked Zhang Chunqiu about it, but Zhang Chunqiu only said some ambiguous words to the average person. He only persuaded a few people not to touch Dubhe.</p>
<p>“We have to retrieve the Companion Beast of Dubhe no matter what.” Berserker Immortal’s figure appeared in the unfinished Skysplit Tower as he ordered Immortal and the Guardians.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, we will definitely do our best to fight for it, but you should know that with the rise of the heroes on Earth, our League of Guardians hasn’t been able to gain an absolute advantage. Together with the uncertain variables like cosmic creatures, it’s really unknown if we can obtain Dubhe’s Companion Beast,” Immortal said with a bow.</p>
<p>“I only care about the results,” Berserker Immortal said coldly.</p>
<p>“I also hope for a good outcome,” Immortal said neither obsequiously nor superciliously.</p>
<p>Berserker Immortal’s gaze was like a sword as he stared at Immortal, as though he wanted to split his body apart. However, Immortal only stood there with his eyes lowered as though he hadn’t seen anything.</p>
<p>“Whoever can retrieve Dubhe’s Companion Beast can become the representative of our Immortals in the mortal world. I will personally bestow him as the strongest Guardian of the Immortals,” said Berserker Immortal.</p>
<p>The Immortals had always respected the strong. Berserker Immortal believed that it was the same for humans. He wanted to use this to incite an internal division among the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>However, Blood Shaman and the other Guardians didn’t seem to hear him as they continued to stand by Immortal’s side.</p>
<p>A cold glint flashed in Berserker Immortal’s eyes, but he suppressed his killing intent. Just as Wang Mingyuan had said, the situation on Earth was already relatively clear. Even if the Immortals began nurturing new factions now, it wouldn’t be of any use anytime soon.</p>
<p>If he wanted to maintain his competitiveness on Earth, he had to continue using the League of Guardians. There weren’t many other options.</p>
<p>The six families had always been vassals of the Holy Land. Although the six families wanted to escape the Holy Land’s control, it wasn’t necessarily possible for them to completely escape it. Secondly, even if they could really escape, it might be a result of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
<p>There was also the federal government, the Holy Spirit Association, and the various warlords. Under Hui Haifeng’s leadership, the federal government had been developing the strength of humans, so it was even more impossible for them to be used by the Immortals.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit Association directly devoured Guardians. If the Immortals worked with them, they would probably only be feeding them. It would be difficult to truly control them.</p>
<p>As for the warlords from the various lands, if there was a chance, Berserker Immortal didn’t mind giving them some benefits and getting them under the Immortal’s employ. However, there weren’t many warlords who could truly achieve the level of the six families. Gaining control of them couldn’t be done anytime soon.</p>
<p>At this stage, Berserker Immortal could only get the League of Guardians to continue working for the Immortals.</p>
<p>However, Berserker Immortal had already made up his mind to establish a faction that completely obeyed the Immortals as soon as possible and kick the League of Guardians out.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. My race will definitely help you when needed. Skysplit Tower has to be repaired as soon as possible. Otherwise, even if my race wants to help you, we won’t be able to deliver the items to you.” Although Berserker Immortal said that, he thought to himself, All I need is a portion of Skysplit Tower repaired and I can use it to enter Earth and reestablish a human faction that belongs to the Immortals. Once I succeed, I’ll kill that bastard Wang Mingyuan first.</p>
<p>“Skysplit Tower has been attacked twice in a row. Many materials are nowhere to be found. It’s very difficult to repair it. Your Excellency, I wonder if you have a way to repair it?” Immortal kicked the ball back to Berserker Immortal’s court.</p>
<p>Although Berserker Immortal wanted to kill Immortal with one strike, he couldn’t do so. All he could do was say, “There’s naturally a way. Previously, my race placed Guardian cocoons in many mystic realms. Now, those mystic realms have already transformed into dimensional zones. I’ll send you the information regarding the Guardian cocoons. After you find them, use the Guardian inside to help you and you can naturally easily occupy those dimensional zones and obtain the resources inside.”</p>
<p>“We will definitely do our best to serve you, Your Excellency.” Immortal bowed with the Guardians.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t figured out what was going on with the land and the giant bird’s skeleton, but he didn’t dare take the risk to experiment. All he could do was ignore it for the time being.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen was studying his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>After the two Golden Wyrms gave birth, another Golden Wyrm appeared. However, this Golden Wyrm seemed a little different from its parents.</p>
<p>Golden Wyrm: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Metal Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Gold Essence</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Love is Stronger than Gold. Terror Form: Stator (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: True Gold Fire Refinement (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 100</p>
<p>Speed: 100</p>
<p>Constitution: 100</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 100</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Midas Touch, Strangle, Unstoppable, Dominance Body</p>
<p>Companion Form: Stator</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what a Stator Companion Form was. He made the Golden Wyrm appear in its companion form and realized that its body had turned into a coiled dragon pillar.</p>
<p>It was clearly a pillar, but for some reason, it was called a stator.</p>
<p>With the experience from the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, Zhou Wen tried putting the three Golden Wyrms into the fusion frame. Indeed, he could fuse them. Furthermore, the success rate was 99.9%. There was almost no chance of failure.</p>
<p>Should I fuse them? Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. After all, these were three Calamity-grade creatures. If he fused them, even if a Hell-grade creature appeared, it would only be a Companion Beast. It didn’t seem worth it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1499'>Chapter 1499 Good Luck Comes</h3>
<p>The stats and skills are about the same. If I can’t deal with an opponent with a single Golden Wyrm, having two more Golden Wyrms shouldn’t be of much use. Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before pressing the fusion button.</p>
<p>A golden light flashed as the three Golden Wyrms emitted a shocking glow. Finally, the entire screen was occupied by the golden light.</p>
<p>When the light gradually dissipated, the three Golden Wyrms vanished, leaving only a golden pair of scissors on the screen.</p>
<p>Two Golden Wyrms became shears, while a single Golden Wyrm was a stator. Together, they fused into Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Golden Wyrm Scissors: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Metal Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Gold Essence Wheel of Destiny: Love is Stronger than Gold.</p>
<p>Terror Form: Golden Wyrm Scissors (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: True Gold Fire Refinement (Hell)</p>
<p>Strength: 200 Speed: 200</p>
<p>Constitution: 200</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 200</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Midas Touch, Strangle, Unstoppable, Dominance Body, Clean Break</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Wyrm Scissors</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he saw the stats of the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Although it was a three-for-one exchange, the stats of the Golden Wyrm Scissors were definitely greater than the three Golden Wyrms.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else, the Human Realm Golden Wyrm only had 100 for its stats, but the Hell-level Golden Wyrm Scissors’ stats doubled.</p>
<p>Its abilities didn’t seem to have changed much, but with the addition of Cleaned Break, it looked very powerful.</p>
<p>Who should I test it on? Zhou Wen looked at his phone dungeon and realized that the Venusian instance dungeon had respawned an hour ago. He could try it out.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The moment the Golden Wyrm Scissors appeared, all the Metal Guards and Golden Battle Gods were sliced into two with one strike. No one could withstand its might.</p>
<p>However, the Golden Wyrm Scissors had a weakness. It could only snip one creature at a time-it didn’t have any AOE attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Soul Mirror to make the Calamity gunner appear. With a golden flash, the Calamity gunner, whose speed couldn’t be considered slow, was split into two before he could react.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>A Companion Egg dropped with a crisp sound. Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to fly over and pick it up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been eyeing the Calamity gunner’s Companion Egg for a long time. Its long-range offensive strength was truly impressive, especially the seventh shot. Without a countermeasure, one couldn’t escape the sure-kill shot.</p>
<p>Nothing can really stop you when luck befalls you. Zhou Wen excitedly checked the Calamity gunner Companion Egg’s stats.</p>
<p>Golden Sniper: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Sharpshooter</p>
<p>Life Soul: Firearms God</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Sure-kill Seventh Strike (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Bullet Zone (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 168</p>
<p>Speed: 179</p>
<p>Constitution: 107</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 178</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Infinite Bullets, Metal Escape, Ultra Rapid Fire, Ultra Long-Distance Fire, Life-Extinguishing Bullets.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sniper Rifle</p>
<p>Haha, it’s indeed a sniper rifle! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had indeed been eyeing it for a long time.</p>
<p>Compared to melee weapons, Zhou Wen preferred to shoot from afar. He only fought in melee combat when he had no choice. If he could kill the enemy from afar, why would he have to rush out and risk his life?</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen hatched Golden Sniper. This kind of Companion Beast that didn’t require growth from the beginning had stats reaching a certain level. There was no need for him to waste crystals to raise its stats. It was very useful to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Apart from the lacking Constitution, the other stats of the Golden Sniper were pretty good. It was already considered pretty good at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>A massive amount of Essence Energy was absorbed by the Companion Egg. Soon, the Companion Egg transformed into golden streams of light that landed in Zhou Wen’s palm, forming the symbol of a golden sniper rifle.</p>
<p>After flashing for a while, the golden sniper rifle symbol slowly vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand and a golden sniper rifle appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>However, the sniper rifle was a little bigger than Zhou Wen imagined. It looked like a Barret M82A1 sniper rifle but even bigger. It wasn’t impossible to fire it using one hand, but it was a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s inhuman physique, he could still shoot from the hip, but it looked like shooting with a mount would be more reliable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched dungeons and entered Chess Mountain. He mounted the sniper rifle in the cave and aimed it at a fake immortal on Deer Terrace Pavilion.</p>
<p>After aiming slightly, Zhou Wen squeezed the trigger.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A fake immortal’s head exploded as she returned to her original fox spirit body and collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shot one after another, blasting apart the heads of the fake immortals. With the butt of the gun pressed against his shoulder, Zhou Wen’s shoulder involuntarily trembled as he fired.</p>
<p>He watched as the fake immortals spun about and huddled together, but they couldn’t find the enemy. All they could do was have their heads explode one after another. This thrill was indescribable.</p>
<p>Great stuff… This thing’s shooting range is awesome… It’s much further than the range of ordinary sniper rifles on Earth. It’s impossible for ordinary creatures to discover where the bullet came from. The more Zhou Wen looked at it, the more he liked it. It was like the best assassination weapon.</p>
<p>In the future, if Zhou Wen wanted to cause trouble for the League of Guardians, he didn’t need to approach the headquarters of the League of Guardians. A bullet from fifty kilometers away could send the Guardians to the afterlife. With the bullets traveling at the speed of light, fifty kilometers was nothing.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, the League of Guardians was Jiang Yan’s. It wasn’t appropriate for him to kill another Guardian.</p>
<p>I should find an opportunity to make a trip to the Holy Land. I’ll stand guard outside the Holy Land. I’ll headshot every Saint that comes out. Let’s see who else dares to work for the Holy Land. With this in mind, Zhou Wen wished he could grow wings and fly to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just a thought on his part. It was clearly impossible for him to raid the Holy Land with just a sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Now, I have the golden sniper rifle for long-range combat and the Golden Wyrm Scissors for close combat. With the Soul Mirror’s help, as long as I don’t encounter a Heaven-level dimensional creature, I should be able to put up a fight. Zhou Wen searched his dungeon again and realized that Yang City had already respawned.</p>
<p>He entered Yang City and released the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Every Blood Shadow that appeared was severed. The sniper was even more merciless. It was one shot, one kill, as simple as shooting balloons at a street fair.</p>
<p>After the Kui came out, the Golden Wyrm Scissors flew up and snapped it into two. Even the Kui’s powerful defense couldn’t withstand a single snip. The Golden Wyrm Scissors were so sharp that it chilled one’s heart.</p>
<p>Too powerful! Zhou Wen realized that he had too many weapons, but his defense now couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>Kui only dropped one Essence Energy Crystal. Zhou Wen didn’t have any room to raise his Essence Energy stat for the time being, so he fed it to the Soul Mirror which had a relatively low attribute.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to find a few more places to test the might of the Golden Wyrm Scissors and sniper rifle when he suddenly received a message: “Are you interested in cooperating?”</p>
