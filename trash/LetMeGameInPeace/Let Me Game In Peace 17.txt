<h3 id='chapter1600'>Chapter 1600: Saber Practice</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue attacked and moved at increasing speeds. It was similar to Feng Qiuyan’s swift saber.</p>
<p>However, Starlord Ardent Virtue’s speed was many times faster than Feng Qiuyan’s. Zhou Wen couldn’t keep up with such speed. Even with his judgment, he still couldn’t withstand his attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to summon the Golden Wyrm Scissors to kill Starlord Ardent Virtue, but on second thought, such a swift sword was very rare. If he killed Starlord Ardent Virtue now, he didn’t know when he would respawn. Instead of killing him straight away, he might as well use him to</p>
<p>practice his saber techniques.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal also clinched victory through speed. To have such an opponent in combat training was many times better than training by himself.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen gave up on the idea of killing Starlord Ardent Virtue and only fought with his saber techniques.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal was very strong, but Zhou Wen’s Speed and Strength were much weaker than Starlord Ardent Virtue’s. It was very difficult to make up for the difference with pure saber techniques.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Starlord Ardent Virtue’s swift sword had already reached a sublime realm with ever increasing speeds. Before long, Zhou Wen couldn’t withstand it and had his heart penetrated by Starlord Ardent Virtue’s sword.</p>
<p>The game screen went black as Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive. He entered Alioth Star Palace again.</p>
<p>The repeated battles all ended with Zhou Wen’s death.</p>
<p>However, such battles weren’t completely meaningless.</p>
<p>The Disqualified allowed Zhou Wen to see Starlord Ardent Virtue’s flaws, but because he was too fast, he couldn’t grasp them even if he saw them,</p>
<p>As for Starlord Ardent Virtue’s trajectory recorded by the Teacher Domain, although it wasn’t as direct as a video, it simplified matters, allowing Zhou Wen to understand many things directly.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue’s sword was very fast, and it looked disorganized. It seemed to have no fixed trajectory, making it impossible to predict it or guard against it.</p>
<p>However, from the trajectories recorded by the Teacher Domain, Starlord Ardent Virtue’s attacks weren’t without pattern.</p>
<p>Its attacks had too many variations. There were so many that it was impossible for humans to remember them. It was like a repeating decimal. No matter how many numbers there were in the middle, they would eventually repeat. It wasn’t like an irrational number with no discernible pattern.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue’s attacks were so variable that there were a million, or even more, possibilities. Therefore, ordinary people couldn’t determine his pattern.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen, who had the Teacher Domain, predicted the subsequent changes after understanding a portion of his trajectory. He didn’t really need to see all the changes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen increasingly felt that the Teacher Domain’s ability was terrifying. Although it wasn’t a pure Strength-type ability, it was an ability that was closest to the essence of all things.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue’s random sword techniques might not be cracked by others even if they spent their entire lives trying, but Zhou Wen seemed to be able to do so as though he could predict the future. Every time, he would strike first or directly strike his flaws before finally slashing at Starlord Ardent</p>
<p>Virtue. A first for injuring him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. The Teacher Domain was a gift that kept giving. He couldn’t predict what kind of power he could develop in the future.</p>
<p>No, no. This is purely relying on the power of the Teacher Domain to win. I haven’t mastered my saber technique at all. I have to practice my saber. Zhou Wen gave up on using the Teacher Domain and purely used Transcendent Flying Immortal to fight him.</p>
<p>The three thousand sword intents were very strong, as was the Heart Defying Sword Art, but in comparison, Zhou Wen preferred Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>The reason was that Transcendent Flying Immortal was simple; it saved him trouble. The three thousand sword intents were too cumbersome; it didn’t really match Zhou Wen’s personality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen died again and again. The experience he obtained in exchange was something that couldn’t be obtained under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only at the Terror grade and didn’t have the augmentation of various domains. The difference between him and the Hell-level Starlord Ardent Virtue was just too great. It was almost impossible for him to win purely in terms of techniques. Every battle could only end with death.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen enjoyed it. Every death made Transcendent Flying Immortal break through.</p>
<p>In the past, although Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal focused on speed, it was leaning towards dominance.</p>
<p>Immortal Slaying, which was born from Transcendent Flying Immortal, was extremely domineering.</p>
<p>However, against an opponent like Starlord Ardent Virtue, if he was domineering, even if Zhou Wen pushed the power of Immortal Slaying to its limits, it would ultimately be akin to an egg striking a rock.</p>
<p>However, Transcendent Flying Immortal wasn’t just domineering. There were other aspects that allowed Zhou Wen to develop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s saber techniques became faster and faster as they became more and more elegant. His body was like a flying immortal and his saber came from beyond the heavens. His saber techniques and movement techniques became more unpredictable.</p>
<p>Others were straightforward with their saber techniques, but Zhou Wen’s saber techniques became more curved.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom had the chance to purely practice a particular skill because he cultivated too many Essence Energy Arts, making it difficult for him to advance.</p>
<p>Other humans who used Mythical Serums, Spirit Casting, or contracted Guardians only needed to find a suitable Zone Core to quickly advance to the Calamity grade or even rapidly reach a higher level.</p>
<p>In order to keep up with the progress, Zhou Wen had no choice but to devote a large amount of time to his various Essence Energy Arts and the search for dimensional zones.</p>
<p>Although it was very difficult, the benefits he obtained were inestimable.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible for other humans of the same level to clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon alone. There was always a Starlord who could restrain their strength and make victory almost impossible.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon alone. This was the difference.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal, he suddenly heard a commotion.</p>
<p>The commotion was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Wen put down his phone and listened attentively. Truth Listener immediately transformed the sound into an image that appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>A huge warship-like behemoth was entering the atmosphere. It produced a lightning-like glow from friction with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The azure lightning produced by the friction with the atmosphere covered its entire body, making it look like a huge electric eel wrapped in azure lightning.</p>
<p>Unlike an electric eel, it had a pair of wings on both sides of its body. The four wings that resembled butterfly wings were also enveloped by azure lightning. As it flapped its wings, the lightning produced by the friction spread out in the atmosphere. Lightning flashed between the sky and land,</p>
<p>illuminating the originally dark planet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. Although the lightning wasn’t emitted by the cosmic creature, the fact that it could produce lightning from friction had something to do with its body.</p>
<p>From the might of the lightning, he knew that this cosmic creature was definitely not an easy opponent.</p>
<p>According to what Zhou Wen knew, cosmic creatures were typically split into two types. One type was Companion Beasts that tore out of celestial bodies. They were in the minority, but they were extremely impressive. If he encountered one in the universe, escaping immediately was the best choice.</p>
<p>The second type was more common. For dimensional creatures like Tsukuyomi who came from planets, they varied in strength, but no matter how weak they were, they would at least be at the Mythical stage or above. There were Terror and Calamity creatures, but Calamity creatures occupied the</p>
<p>majority.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because fewer creatures of other levels entered the universe, but because too many had died.</p>
<p>The cosmic creature in front of him looked at least at the Human Realm. It might even be stronger…</p>
<h3 id='chapter1601'>Chapter 1601: Void Salamander</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>As he wasn’t sure what level the cosmic creature was or what kind of power it had, Zhou Wen tried his best to hide his aura, hoping that it wouldn’t discover him.</p>
<p>Anything could happen in a battle with the unknown. Zhou Wen could improvise based on the situation, but Tsukuyomi couldn’t move. It would be troublesome if something happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish for any trouble, but the cosmic creature seemed to be coming for him. After tearing through the atmosphere, it clearly rushed towards the glacier rift.</p>
<p>Although it might be a coincidence, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait any longer. He didn’t wish to take the risk. Instead of waiting for the cosmic creature to come and end up fighting beside Tsukuyomi, he might as well attack first and divert the battlefield as far away as possible.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he summoned the Soul Mirror, the Golden Sniper, and Starlord Ravenous Wolf to guard the ice cavern to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and silently rushed out of the rift, heading straight for the cosmic creature.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that if the Invisibility Cloak could hide from the cosmic creature’s senses, he could use the Golden Wyrm Scissors to slice it into two when he came close. Better be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>However, before he could approach the cosmic creature, he saw it flap its wings. Lightning rained down like a storm, immediately enveloping the nearby area.</p>
<p>The Terror-grade Invisibility Cloak is still inadequate. Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain, causing the terrifying lightning to vanish.</p>
<p>Summoning Bamboo Blade in hand, Zhou Wen continued charging at the cosmic creature.</p>
<p>Although the lightning on its body kept spewing out, it would vanish the moment it entered the Teacher Domain’s range. This made Zhou Wen feel a lot more at ease. As long as the Teacher Domain could be of use, he would have a huge advantage.</p>
<p>The cosmic creature didn’t panic when it saw the lightning on its body vanish. It continued charging at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The entire body of the cosmic creature was enveloped in the Teacher Domain. The lightning over its body vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen released the Golden Wyrm Scissors and slashed at the cosmic creature without any hesitation. He simultaneously drew the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed out a terrifying sword beam using the most domineering Immortal Slaying.</p>
<p>Ina real-life battle, striking first to gain the upper hand against an unknown enemy was the best choice. He didn’t have the luxury of figuring out his opponent’s abilities like in-game.</p>
<p>No matter what the opponent’s ability was, as long as he killed it immediately, it would be useless no matter how impressive its abilities were.</p>
<p>The cosmic creature was extremely fast. It flapped its wings and dodged the Immortal Culling Sword’s slash, but it failed to dodge the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack.</p>
<p>With a crack, the cosmic creature’s head was snipped off.</p>
<p>Blood splattered across the sky as the head and corpse fell and smashed into the glacier. Large swaths of the glacier cracked as blood flowed everywhere.</p>
<p>With the Teacher Domain combined with the Golden Wyrm Scissors, I’m practically invincible. Zhou Wen was delighted.</p>
<p>‘The Teacher Domain restrained the enemy’s powers, and the Golden Wyrm Scissors was a specialist in melee combat. There was no better combination than them.</p>
<p>‘The Swan Wings on Zhou Wen’s back flapped as he instantly arrived in front of the cosmic creature’s corpse.</p>
<p>From the wound, he could tell that its body was crystalline and somewhat similar to fresh shrimp meat. Furthermore, it emitted a strange luster.</p>
<p>The bones inside were like white jade. There were fine scales around its body, and they also looked like jade. From its appearance, one would almost think that it was a white jade statue.</p>
<p>With a thought from him, the Golden Wyrm Scissors flew over and cut open its body. He hoped to find dimensional crystals.</p>
<p>He didn’t find any dimensional crystals, but there was a single bone shimmering with a strange lightning glow. It was obvious that it had undergone a Calamity transformation. This thing was food for Calamity-grade creatures, and it was also the energy needed for the evolution of the Calamity Zone.</p>
<p>The entire bone was huge and spanned more than a hundred meters. It was impossible to devour it. One could only use Essence Energy Arts to absorb the energy within.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t good at lightning. Even if he absorbed the lightning energy, it wouldn’t be of much use. Therefore, he stored the single bone in the chaos space.</p>
<p>Although there was energy in the flesh and blood, the energy contained was relatively low because the flesh hadn’t undergone a Calamity transformation. Furthermore, the energy would quickly dissipate into the universe. It was useless keeping it. At most, he could only roast it for food.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to cut open the alien creature’s head. Immediately, he saw a crystalline Companion Egg inside its skull.</p>
<p>A Companion Egg! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly took out the Companion Egg and used his phone to snap a picture.</p>
<p>Void Salamander: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Body of Origin</p>
<p>Life Soul: Soul of Lightning</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Vacuity Kill</p>
<p>Terror Form: Lightning Origin (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: True Void Zone (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 105</p>
<p>Speed: 101</p>
<p>Constitution: 124</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 117</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Wings of Thunder, Sky Lightning Strike, Wings of Lightning, Void Slash.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Mount</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a mount-type Companion Beast. This fellow’s stats are pretty good, but he’s only at the Human Realm. Furthermore, it’s lining the bottom. I’m quite surprised. From the way it appeared, I thought it was at the Hell level, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Although the Void Salamander’s stats and level were weaker than Zhou Wen imagined, it was already extremely lucky to obtain a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen put away the Companion Egg and didn’t immediately incubate it.</p>
<p>Companion Eggs could be used as supplementary materials. If they were combined with a Companion Beast, they wouldn’t change the Companion Beast’s original characteristics. It was very convenient to use such a high-level Companion Egg to raise a Companion Beast’s level.</p>
<p>If two Companion Beasts were combined, it was very easy to produce changes, albeit unpredictable ones.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cut some of the flesh of the Void Salamander and sliced it into thin slices. He took out a stove and pot and slid the meat slices in the pot. He dabbed it in some sauce and placed it in his mouth.</p>
<p>Mm, it’s really delicious! It’s much better than shrimp, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Demonic Neonate is still sleeping. Otherwise, she would definitely like it, Znou Wen mused regretfully as he ate.</p>
<p>‘As he was eating, he suddenly felt the glacier beneath his feet tremble as though a fluctuation was spreading through it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. The average person might not know what had happened, but Zhou Wen heard a high-frequency sound wave that ordinary people couldn’t hear through Truth Listener. The sound wave came from beyond the planet.</p>
<p>To be able to produce sound waves from space and affect the interior of a planet, such power was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up into the void and his expression changed drastically. He saw a gigantic Void Salamander rushing towards the planet. Its body was more than ten times bigger than the one Zhou Wen had killed and had almost completely transformed into blazing white lightning. It descended towards</p>
<p>Zhou Wen like a thundercloud that blotted out the sky..7</p>
<h3 id='chapter1602'>Chapter 1602: Heaven Level</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat in a daze when he heard the huge Void Salamander’s roar. He was still holding chopsticks in his hand with a piece of freshly cooked salamander meat between them.</p>
<p>This… Zhou Wen stared at the Salamander in the sky with widened eyes. A chill ran down his spine all the way to the soles of his feet.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the Void Salamander to react, Zhou Wen threw away the chopsticks in his hand and activated the Teacher Domain again. At the same time, he summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors, pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword, and charged at the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew very well that the slightly smaller Void Salamander was most likely its son. There was no room for negotiation now that he had cooked its son. Unless he chose to escape, it would be a situation of fighting to the death.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t escape or Tsukuyomi would be a goner if she was discovered.</p>
<p>Asmall Void Salamander was at the Human Realm. Who knew what level this huge Void Salamander was at? It was at least at the Hell level. The possibility of it being at the Heaven level was very high.</p>
<p>If he was unlucky and it was at the Apocalypse grade, Zhou Wen was already prepared to flee for his life.</p>
<p>The blazing white lightning on the Void Salamander’s body surged and surged down like an ocean. After touching the Teacher Domain, the lightning immediately dimmed.</p>
<p>However, the lightning didn’t disappear like before. It only dimmed significantly, but it still maintained its lightning form and quickly spread in the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>No way! Even the Teacher Domain can’t seal it! Zhou Wen’s pupils constricted as his body instinctively instant transmitted into the cosmos.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander’s body was huge, but its actions weren’t clumsy. With a flash of lightning, its huge body vanished. When it appeared again, it was already in front of Zhou Wen. It opened its mouth, hoping to devour him.</p>
<p>Before it could close its mouth, the lightning inside smote down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only use the Chaos Egg to withstand the terrifying lightning blast before instant transmitting out before its mouth snapped to a close to escape the fate of being devoured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly instant transmitted as he rushed out of the atmosphere and arrived in space.</p>
<p>During this process, the Void Salamander stayed on Zhou Wer’s heels. Its body vanished into thin air like lightning and appeared out of thin air again. Every time it appeared, it nearly devoured Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen escaped death time and time again, he was constantly struck by lightning.</p>
<p>A large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals appeared in the Chaos Egg. What was even more terrifying was that a portion of the lightning seeped into the Chaos Egg, causing Zhou Wen’s body to tremble.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Teacher Domain had already sealed a portion of the lightning powers. The Chaos Egg had blocked more than half of them. Otherwise, just one bolt of lightning could have charred Zhou Wen to ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly figured out that the Void Salamander was most likely at the Heaven level.</p>
<p>This was bad news, but it was also good news.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew that he was far from the Heaven-level Void Salamander’s match, but he still had a chance of escaping. At the very least, he wouldn’t be crushed to death.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had lured the Void Salamander away from the planet. Tsukuyomi should be safe for the time being.</p>
<p>Now, all Zhou Wen needed to do was lure the Void Salamander further away. Then, he could use Singularity Universe to teleport to a distant galaxy and escape the Void Salamander’s pursuit.</p>
<p>The domain power of a Heaven-level creature has indeed undergone a qualitative change. It can actually break through the Teacher Domain’s seal and the Chaos Egg’s defense. As Zhou Wen fled, he circulated the Beginningless Sword Domain with all his might.</p>
<p>The Sword Pills that filled the sky faced the blazing white lightning, but they were all destroyed by the lightning in an instant. They turned to their Yin aspect and vanished.</p>
<p>The terrifying lightning passed through the Teacher Domain and struck the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The seemingly gapless Chaos Egg cracked at the spots where strikes were combined under the lightning’s bombardment. The lightning seeped in and made Zhou Wen scream as his hair stood up.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s domain was sufficiently powerful. Furthermore, it had multiple domains. If it were at the ordinary Human Realm, even a Hell-level creature would have blasted him to ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly instant transmitted to escape, but the Void Salamander’s speed was just too fast. When he instant transmitted again, the Void Salamander’s mouth was already waiting for him as countless bolts of lightning swept down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was no longer capable of instant transmission. All he could do was use interstellar teleportation to teleport to a distant planet.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of the matter, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to choose which planet to go to. Therefore, he randomly chose a planet to distance himself from the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander will soon be lured away. I hope it won’t return to that planet. Zhou Wen wanted to teleport back and see how Tsukuyomi was doing.</p>
<p>However, he was afraid that he would lure the Void Salamander over if he teleported back. Tsukuyomi couldn’t move, nor could he touch her. It would make matters worse.</p>
<p>‘As Zhou Wen was too far away from Tsukuyomi, the Companion Beasts he had left with her had automatically returned to him. Tsukuyomi didn’t have any protection now.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating, he saw a flash of lightning. The Void Salamander appeared in front of him again. Even interstellar teleportation failed to shake it off.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>He was still worried about Tsukuyomi, but now, he could only worry about himself.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that it was impossible for him to shake off the Void Salamander when it could actually follow him despite such a distant interstellar teleportation.</p>
<p>What should I do? Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he thought of several solutions.</p>
<p>The first solution was to teleport back to Earth. According to Zhou Wen’s experience, the entire universe had a very strong nomological suppression for dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Earth’s rules had a powerful suppressive effect on dimensional creatures in the universe. Creatures above the Calamity grade, even if they didn’t come from the dimension, would still be greatly suppressed in Earth’s interior.</p>
<p>Even a native Calamity like Tsukuyomi could only leave Earth if she didn’t want to be suppressed.</p>
<p>Therefore, after returning to Earth and using Earth’s rules, he might be able to escape the pursuit of the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>If it dared to chase him into Earth, he might even be able to use Earth’s suppression to kill it.</p>
<p>However, there was a drawback to doing so.</p>
<p>If the Void Salamander wasn’t suppressed immediately after charging into Earth, or if the suppression wasn’t enough to make it drop below the Calamity grade, its strength would bring about a destructive calamity for Earth.</p>
<p>Although such a disaster wouldn’t destroy Earth, it was still fully capable of destroying a few human cities.</p>
<p>As he wasn’t sure when the Void Salamander would be suppressed, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen decided to try Plan B. It was to head to the Big Dipper and enter the Big Dipper Palaces.</p>
<p>As long as he lured the Void Salamander in and allowed it to attack Starlord Cherished Kismet, he might be able to kill it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability could kill the Void Salamander. After all, the power of the Heaven level had somewhat exceeded Zhou Wen’s knowledge..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1603'>Chapter 1603: Fleeing into the Star Palace</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>At this point, Zhou Wen had no other choice. He had to give it a try. If Starlord Cherished Kismet’s strength couldn’t kill the Void Salamander, Zhou Wen could only return to Earth to seek refuge.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder even Calamity creatures are afraid of the cosmos. There are countless creatures like the Void Salamander in the universe. If I’m unlucky, I’ll basically die if I encounter one. Zhou Wen used interstellar teleportation with all his might to teleport to Phecda.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>He had to use the Cube previously because he was in the dimension, so he naturally didn’t need to use the Cube to enter the Big Dipper dimensional zone again.</p>
<p>He arrived at the entrance of Phecda’s dimensional zone and saw the Void Salamander descend with the lightning that blotted out the sky. Without any hesitation, he used spatial teleportation and entered the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen rushed in, he was surprised to discover that he wasn’t in Phecda Star Palace, but Dubhe Palace.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could figure out what was going on, he saw the lightning blast dissipate as the Void Salamander appeared in Dubhe.</p>
<p>‘The Cubes around the world lit up. The scene that appeared was Dubhe Palace, where Zhou Wen was.</p>
<p>“Eh, it’s Egg Sovereign. He’s already first. Why is he still challenging the levels?”</p>
<p>“What do you know? This is called surpassing oneself.”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is awesome. The other creatures are vying for first place, but he’s trying to surpass himself.”</p>
<p>“Wow, what’s that lightning? It looks like a lightning dragon with butterfly wings!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, the Companion Beast that Egg Sovereign summoned looks even more ferocious than the Tiger Soul General!”</p>
<p>Many people believed that the Void Salamander was a Companion Beast summoned by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay when he saw the Void Salamander enter. He pushed open the door and rushed into Dubhe Palace without stopping.</p>
<p>‘When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw Zhou Wen enveloped by the Chaos Egg, he immediately used his starlight domain and punched at him with the power of starlight.</p>
<p>The blast of light was like a volcanic eruption as it drowned Zhou Wen and the entire Star Palace.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander that rushed in behind him didn’t hesitate to cast lightning.</p>
<p>The originally terrifying starlight domain appeared weak under the void lightning. Starlord Ravenous Wolf and the starlight domain were instantly reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed to the teleportation nexus against the lightning and chose to teleport to the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>“How domineering. What Companion Beast is that?”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign’s new Companion Beast seems to be even more ferocious than the Tiger Soul General. That lightning is too domineering!”</p>
<p>“Where does Egg Sovereign get his Companion Beasts from? It’s so enviable.”</p>
<p>Many people’s eyes turned red with envy, but they didn’t know that Zhou Wen was feeling utterly miserable.</p>
<p>After he teleported to Merak Star Palace, the Cube’s screen changed to Merak Star Palace. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen pushed open the door and rushed in.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander rushed in after him.</p>
<p>Just as Starlord Titan Gate stood up, lightning descended from the sky. He was blasted to pieces before he could even stand up, much less open his mouth.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen charged crazily amidst the lightning and stood on the teleportation nexus again, teleporting to the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>“Another instant kill. He’s too powerful.”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is looking invincible!”</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? How did Egg Sovereign obtain such a powerful Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“The heavens must be jealous of my looks. Otherwise, why don’t I have such a powerful Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>Everyone watched as the Void Salamander unleashed its might. They were envious, jealous, and hateful, but Zhou Wen had already rushed into the Phecda Star Palace.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was extremely nervous. This was his last chance.</p>
<p>If Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability couldn’t kill the Void Salamander, Starlord Ardent Virtue behind him would definitely be even more useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had yet to explore the subsequent Star Palace. It was dangerous for him to enter alone, so it was naturally impossible for him to continue. When the time came, he could only teleport back to Earth to seek refuge.</p>
<p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take this path.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s situation isn’t good.” Not everyone was that ignorant. Zhang Chunqiu and company could tell that the Void Salamander wasn’t Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, but a dimensional creature that was pursuing him.</p>
<p>“That fellow really knows how to cause trouble. Can’t he just stay at home? Why does he have to provoke such a terrifying creature? I guess he just likes to tempt fate.” Xia Liuchuan really couldn’t figure out why such a fellow was still alive.</p>
<p>‘Wang Lu was extremely nervous when she saw Zhou Wen being pursued. She held her hands in front of her chest as though she was praying.</p>
<p>Inside the Holy Land, Holy God was also watching the battle.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God, from the looks of it, it’s a Heaven-level creature. Zhou Wen has actually provoked it. I’m afraid he won’t be able to escape death,” said the Saint standing beside him.</p>
<p>‘The Saint’s hair and beard were white, making him look ancient. He wore a white robe, making it impossible to tell which Holy Temple he belonged to.</p>
<p>“He can’t die,” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, why?” the old Saint asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The Connate Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact is still with him. We have to retrieve it,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“But I’m afraid it’s too late now,” the old Saint said.</p>
<p>“There’s still time. He won’t die so easily. At the very least, he still has the ability to escape. Find Xiao and Jiuyang, Get them to go together and watch the area outside the Star Palace. If Zhou Wen comes out, get them to give that Void Salamander a hand.” Holy God looked at the scene in the Cube with a</p>
<p>deep gaze.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen rushed into the Phecda Star Palace, he headed straight for the area behind Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>Just like before, the Void Salamander descended with lightning and struck Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body was blasted to ashes. Almost at the same time, the Void Salamander’s body shattered, turning into countless sparks that scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>Success! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the joy on his face froze.</p>
<p>The shattered lightning on the Void Salamander’s body automatically gathered together and transformed back into the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, that works? Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>‘The Heaven-level Void Salamander and the Human Realm-level Void Salamander didn’t look like the same creature.</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign’s Companion Beast actually has an undying body. It’s really powerful!” Everyone was even more envious when they saw this scene.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was close to tears. Thankfully, Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability was indeed impressive. He was also restored.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander’s lightning struck again. Starlord Cherished Kismet was killed again as the Void Salamander’s body split apart again.</p>
<p>What should I do? Zhou Wen knew that there was no point in him going to the next Star Palace. The only way out was to return to Earth.</p>
<p>He definitely had to return to Earth. The problem was where..1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1604'>Chapter 1604: Trapped</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Before the Void Salamander took form again, Zhou Wen rushed into the teleportation nexus and left the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander finished taking form and charged out after Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The scene on the Cube immediately changed to a ranking. The Tiger Soul General’s name was still on the rankings. However, the Void Salamander’s name appeared on the rankings now, occupying first place.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Egg Sovereign has taken first and second place!”</p>
<p>“There’s actually such a thing? This is heaven-defying!”</p>
<p>Ordinary people imagined that Egg Sovereign’s Companion Beasts had separately entered the rankings, but in fact, it was only because they didn’t know the mechanism of the Cube that resulted in such a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no such thing as having Companion Beasts enter the rankings. The name ‘Tiger Soul General’ was written by Zhou Wen himself. It represented Zhou Wen himself and not the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.</p>
<p>Any creature on the rankings could decide their name with a thought.</p>
<p>However, ordinary people didn’t know this. They imagined that it was a Companion Beast that had entered the rankings from the beginning, but now that the Void Salamander’s name was on the rankings, it caused such a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left the dimensional zone, he immediately wanted to teleport back to Earth. He had already thought of teleporting to Zhuolu and luring the Void Salamander to the underground sea. There were dimensional creatures in the Sapphire Sky and the strange bone sand desert. Perhaps they</p>
<p>could fight the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Even if they weren’t the Void Salamander’s match, as long as they could hold back the Void Salamander for a period of time and allow the Void Salamander to be slowly suppressed by Earth’s rules, Zhou Wen would eventually be able to turn the tables.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen’s first choice wasn’t Zhuolu, but Chess Mountain. However, considering how Chess Mountain was too close to Luoyang, it would be tragic if the Void Salamander unleashed its might when it arrived. The residents of Luoyang City wouldn’t have the time to retreat into the dimensional</p>
<p>zone.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability to return to Earth, he realized that he couldn’t teleport out.</p>
<p>He frowned and looked around. He realized that there was a strange spatial distortion in the cosmos. The nearby stars looked like phantoms. Several similar stars appeared in different directions.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, we meet again.” A familiar voice sounded from the cosmos. Zhou Wen looked up and saw Xiao, Jiuyang, and an old man with white hair standing in the void.</p>
<p>Xiao’s body seemed to fuse with the distorted void. The power that distorted the cosmos likely originated from his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. Xiao and Jiuyang were here. They had the Holy Land’s Holy Artifacts with them. With the augmentation of the Holy Artifacts, they could reach the Heaven level.</p>
<p>Xiao came from the Trajectory Holy Temple. The Trajectory Holy Temple was best at altering space and time. It would probably be difficult for him to use spatial teleportation to escape now that Xiao had sealed the area.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s body emitted a sun-like glow as he blocked Zhou Wen’s path.</p>
<p>The old Saint stood in the middle of the three of them with his hands in his sleeves. His eyes looked like he hadn’t woken up with his drooping eyelids. He hadn’t used any power.</p>
<p>However, since he came with Jiuyang and Xiao, he was clearly not an ordinary person. Perhaps he was another Saint with a Holy Artifact.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the Void Salamander had already rushed out and swept towards him with lightning bolts that filled the sky.</p>
<p>Behind him was the powerful Void Salamander. The space had been sealed by Xiao, and there were three Saints blocking his path. Zhou Wen immediately fell into an extremely dire situation.</p>
<p>He instantly made a decision. Without a word, he charged at Xiao and company, hoping to lure the three of them into the battle.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander didn’t distinguish between friend and foe. When the lightning struck, it would sweep through the battlefield. When that happened, he might have a chance of escaping.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen charged at Xiao and company, he realized that the space in front of him had stacked up. The distance looked short, but he couldn’t reach it no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this was likely Xiao’s spatial domain. He immediately activated the Teacher Domain, hoping to seal it.</p>
<p>The power of the Teacher Domain did seal a portion of the spatial domain, but it couldn’t completely seal it. The space ahead remained stacked, making it difficult for him to rush forward.</p>
<p>Damn it!Zhou Wen already knew that the power of the Teacher Domain could seal all sorts of domain powers, but if the other party’s domain reached the Heaven-level’s perfect domain, he wouldn’t be able to completely seal it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that there was another domain power in the spatial domain. The domain power that also restrained Zhou Wen couldn’t be seen or touched, but it had been in effect all this while. The power likely came from the old Saint.</p>
<p>Two Heaven-level domain powers trapped Zhou Wen in space. Even if Zhou Wen had a chance to rush over, Jiuyang was already waiting for him with the Holy Artifact in hand. He definitely wouldn’t give him a chance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, before Zhou Wen could think of a way to continue forward, the Void Salamander had already arrived behind him. Large swaths of lightning drowned the Chaos Egg as the huge Salamander’s mouth was just seconds from swallowing it.</p>
<p>Goddamnit! Zhou Wen instant transmitted and dodged the Void Salamander’s devouring despite the void lightning.</p>
<p>However, his instant transmission could only be maintained for a very short distance. He was unable to break through the spatial folds and even the range of the void lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only use all his strength to circle around the Void Salamander as he thought of a way to escape.</p>
<p>“Give him more pressure. Try to end the battle quickly,” the old Saint said to Jiuyang and Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao smiled and said, “Old K, there’s no rush. With our domains limiting him in space, he won’t have a chance to escape. Sooner or later, he will die at the mouth of the Void Salamander. Besides, if we join in the fray, we might give him a chance. It’s not as safe as this.”</p>
<p>“That Zhou Wen is only an ordinary Calamity. He’s at most at the Hell level. The three of us will join the fray with Holy Artifacts. What’s there to be afraid of” Old K said with a frown.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that. You haven’t fought him before and don’t know how powerful this guy is. I think it’s best to be safe. Jiuyang has fought him before. Why don’t we hear what Jiuyang has to say?” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang, what are your thoughts on this?” Old K looked at Jiuyang.</p>
<p>“can’t see through him,” Jiuyang said calmly.</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s wait and see,” Old K said after some thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly shuttled through the lightning. Although he wasn’t devoured by the Void Salamander, he was constantly blasted by the lightning.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen discovered something very strange. There seemed to be something brewing in the Teacher Domain..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1605'>Chapter 1605 Grand Void Lightning Art</h3>
<p>The Teacher Domain couldn’t completely seal a perfected domain. A perfected domain would constantly leave trajectories in the Teacher Domain like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. As the power in the Teacher Domain constantly changed, the puzzle would become more and more complete.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen didn’t sense much of it, but as the trajectories became more and more complete, he realized that they seemed to be changing</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been fighting the Void Salamander for so long that he didn’t know how many times he had been struck by lightning. The trajectories that resembled a jigsaw puzzle became more and more completed as they seemed to emit a rhythm.</p>
<p>What will happen if I complete those trajectories? Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a way to break out for the time being, so he decided to attempt to piece together the trajectories. The power sealed by the Teacher Domain wouldn’t leave a trajectory in the Teacher Domain-only powers that couldn’t be sealed would leave a trajectory. However, for the same power, some trajectories overlapped, while others didn’t.</p>
<p>Only the trajectories that didn’t overlap would become part of the jigsaw puzzle. The overlapping trajectories were useless.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen needed to do was obtain more non-overlapping trajectories to connect all the trajectories together to form a huge net.</p>
<p>The trajectories produced by the same attack often overlapped. Zhou Wen had to make the Teacher Domain come into contact with the other party’s domain to obtain more trajectories. However, under the attack of the Void Salamander, Zhou Wen found it difficult to protect himself. It was extremely dangerous to make more contact with its domain.</p>
<p>Old K and company had been paying attention to Zhou Wen’s battle with the Void Salamander. Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to fight the Void Salamander to the death, Old K said, “Zhou Wen is like a trapped beast. From the looks of it, we will soon complete the mission.”</p>
<p>“It should be soon,” Xiao said indifferently as he thought to himself. With Jiuyang and Old K here, it’s probably impossible to secretly help Zhou Wen escape. Is it worth exposing my identity for him?</p>
<p>Xiao wasn’t a hesitant person, but at that moment, he was somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to infiltrate the Holy Land. Unless it was a coincidence, it was impossible for him to enter the Holy Land to become a Saint. It was even harder to reach his status. If his identity was exposed, everything he had done previously would be in vain.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Xiao wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice Zhou Wen. However, when he thought of what An Tianzuo had said to him, Xiao hesitated.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao was hesitating, changes happened to the battle.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander originally had the absolute advantage with its lightning powers enveloping Zhou Wen. Under the bombardment of the lightning, more and more lightning bolts appeared in the Chaos Egg’s crevices as though it was about to explode.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the lightning domain released by the Void Salamander seemed to weaken. The sea-like lightning also decreased. “Why is the lightning on the Void Salamander decreasing?” Old K also discovered this situation and frowned.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, Zhou Wen is going all out. This is the last bit of brilliance before his death,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>Jiuyang continued, “The Void Salamander’s lightning isn’t ordinary lightning. Instead of calling it lightning, it’s more like a clash of void powers. You might be capable of melting the void power away even with the use of the Holy Artifact.”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, we didn’t join the battle. Otherwise, we might have been in danger in this caged battle with Zhou Wen.” Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>Old K looked at the battling Zhou Wen and felt that what Xiao and Jiuyang said made sense, but he had a nagging feeling that something was amiss.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, Zhou Wen had already pieced together the trajectories in the Teacher Domain, forming a complete net.</p>
<p>The moment the net was mended, the entire net’s trajectories lit up and emitted a strange glow.</p>
<p>Of course, only Zhou Wen could see this glow</p>
<p>—something that only existed in the Teacher Domain itself.</p>
<p>As the trajectories emitted a glow, they began to change, turning into strange runes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t read them, but he knew what they meant, just like the words in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.</p>
<p>The trajectory-transformed runes constantly flew towards the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, gradually forming scripture text one after another.</p>
<p>Great Void Lightning Art! Zhou Wen vaguely comprehended the true meaning of the words and realized that it was an Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>As the trajectories transformed into scriptures, the Teacher Domain’s seal on the lightning became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>This resulted in the situation Old K and company saw. The lightning released by the Void Salamander was constantly decreasing. The lightning wasn’t melted by Zhou Wen, but the power of the Teacher Domain had sealed the corresponding rules of the void lightning. In the beginning, Old K believed that this was Zhou Wen’s final gamble or his final brilliance before his death.</p>
<p>Old K felt that something was amiss as large swaths of void lightning vanished until the biggest one disappeared.</p>
<p>“No good. That’s not Zhou Wen’s final burst of strength. He found a way to restrain the void lightning!” Xiao shouted in horror, “But how is this possible? How can a Human Realm like him restrain a Heaven-level domain?” “That fellow is indeed difficult to figure out,” Jiuyang said in thought.</p>
<p>“Attack together. We can’t give him any chance. We have to retrieve the Holy Artifact,” Old K said as he rushed into the battlefield. He held a scepter in his hand and pointed at Zhou Wen, who was being pursued by the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>The tip of the scepter emitted a strange glow. Wherever the light shone, Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain converged significantly.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang charged in as well. Jiuyang’s body emitted divine light as he punched Zhou Wen. Divine light erupted as though it wanted to penetrate the universe.</p>
<p>Xiao appeared behind the Chaos Egg like a ghost and struck it, sending it flying. A large number of solid crystals condensed in the Chaos Egg. As for the Great Void Lightning Art’s scripture that appeared in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it had already ended. In the Teacher Domain, all the void lightning powers were sealed, making all the lightning vanish without a trace. Even the Void Salamander’s body transformed from lightning to flesh.</p>
<p>It resembled the tiny Void Salamander that Zhou Wen had killed. It had white jade-like scales and snow-white butterfly wings. Although its body was huge, its speed was astonishing</p>
<p>Unable to release the power of the void lightning, the Void Salamander could only fight using its body. Even so, the same power remained circulating in its body-it just couldn’t be released. Its speed and strength didn’t weaken, and it remained extremely ferocious.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1606'>Chapter 1606 Breaking Through the Encirclement</h3>
<p>The restrictions on Zhou Wen decreased significantly without the void lightning’s bombardment.</p>
<p>Although there were three more people attacking, Zhou Wen felt that this was an opportunity</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao struck the Chaos Egg with his palm. The power that was enough to distort space and rip through time deformed the Chaos Egg greatly. It flew out like a bullet in the shape of an eggplant.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg flew towards the Sun God Light blasted out by Jiuyang, it dodged the Void Salamander’s bite.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s punch was like a sun as it struck the Chaos Egg and sent Zhou Wen flying.</p>
<p>Although the Chaos Egg flickered as though it would crack at any moment, it ultimately didn’t shatter.</p>
<p>The scepter in Old K’s hand slammed into the Chaos Egg that came flying to him. It nearly split the Chaos Egg apart. It looked like a calabash with a thin waist in the middle, but it still didn’t snap.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was actually most afraid of being devoured by the Void Salamander. Although the attacks of Old K and company were ferocious, they failed to deal much damage on him after the screening of the Teacher Domain and the Chaos Egg. Zhou Wen remained virtually unharmed with the Prisoned Dragon armor donned.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Demonic Neonate in his arms, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been injured.</p>
<p>Old K, Xiao, and Jiuyang’s powers also left their trajectories in the Teacher Domain, but Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to piece together their trajectories. After all, he was besieged by four Heaven-level existences. Zhou Wen’s situation was dire.</p>
<p>Old K and company had deliberately avoided the Void Salamander, but since they were attacking Zhou Wen, it was impossible for them to completely dodge it.</p>
<p>The trio attacked the Chaos Egg from different directions when Zhou Wen suddenly retracted his Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the extremely terrifying void lightning on the Void Salamander’s body appeared again, instantly enveloping everyone.</p>
<p>The three people who were attacking Zhou Wen had no choice but to gather their strength to resist the void lightning</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The trio’s strength collided with the void lightning. A terrifying shockwave erupted from the collision of the four Heaven-level forces, tearing open some cracks in Xiao and Old K’s domains.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s senses were extremely sharp as he immediately sensed the existence of the cracks. Without any hesitation, he grabbed the opportunity and rushed out of the Chaos Egg. He unsheathed the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and widened a crack before disappearing with interstellar teleportation.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Old K felt a headache coming on. Zhou Wen had managed to escape under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander was sent retreating by the combined forces of the trio. Its ferocious nature was triggered as lightning erupted from its body, transforming into an infinite sea of lightning that surged towards the trio.</p>
<p>“The Void Salamander can’t be defeated by force. Leave quickly.” Xiao retreated and vanished into the void like a ghost. Jiuyang forcefully blasted away the lightning storm and forged a path before rushing into the distance.</p>
<p>Old K raised his scepter, forming an invisible force that protected his body, but the void lightning could still penetrate it. It made his hair stand on end as smoke emitted.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the scepter had already blocked most of the force. The lightning didn’t kill him.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander didn’t fight them to the death. After spewing out the lightning, its body transformed into an electric blast and vanished in the blink of an eye. Zhou Wen had already teleported back to Earth, but he didn’t go to Zhuolu. Instead, he went to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on heading to the Holy Land because it was useless.</p>
<p>TIC</p>
<p>Although the Holy Land was on Earth, one had to pass through a teleportation nexus to enter it. Apart from that, there was no other way to enter.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if Zhou Wen went to the Holy Land, it was impossible for him to take the Void Salamander in. Furthermore, it was useless even if he did.</p>
<p>The Holy Land was the only place on Earth without any rules to suppress it. There might be an Apocalypse-grade dimensional creature inside. Even if the Void Salamander entered, it wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the beginning, Zhou Wen hadn’t planned on heading to the Holy Land, but the arrival and siege of Old K and company gave him new ideas.</p>
<p>Since Old K and company could ambush him outside the dimensional zone, he too could ambush the Saints outside the Holy Land.</p>
<p>If dimensional creatures left the Holy Land, they would be suppressed by Earth’s rules. Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses wouldn’t leave the Holy Land for no reason. Then, the only creatures that could pose a threat to the Void Salamander were the few Holy Artifact-wielding Saints.</p>
<p>However, those Saints might not be the Void Salamander’s match.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly sensed that the true Heaven-level Void Salamander was much stronger than the Heaven-level powers produced by Xiao and Jiuyang’s reliance on the Holy Artifacts.</p>
<p>So what if it’s the Holy Land? If you want my life, you have to pay the price. Zhou Wen teleported to the vicinity of the Holy Land and quickly felt space tremble. Lightning appeared out of thin air and transformed into the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>“Come on! Big worm!” Zhou Wen immediately rushed towards the teleportation nexus at the entrance of the Holy Land when he saw the Void Salamander appear.</p>
<p>It used to be guarded by members of the six families, but now, it was guarded by Saints. “Who dares to barge into the Holy Land?” A Saint was guarding the area in each of the four directions. When they saw Zhou Wen appear above the teleportation nexus, they immediately shouted in unison, prepared to attack.</p>
<p>Before they could attack, they saw a snow-white glow in the sky. A terrifying sea of lightning descended and instantly electrocuted everything nearby, including the four Saints. Everything within a fifty-kilometer radius was charred black, turning into a huge charred pit.</p>
<p>The teleportation nexus in the middle of the lightning remained standing. Although it was charred black, it wasn’t destroyed.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain condensed the Void Lightning Grand Art, its seal on the void lightning had reached a hundred percent. Zhou Wen converged the Teacher Domain, covering only the Chaos Egg and allowing the other places to be struck by the lightning. The lightning in a radius of fifty kilometers surged like an ocean. Such a commotion had long attracted the Federation’s attention. The satellites in the sky had already captured the images of the lightning sea and the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, isn’t that Egg Sovereign’s Void Salamander? Why did it come to Earth?”</p>
<p>“That looks like the Holy Land, right?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Egg Sovereign is attacking the Holy Land!”</p>
<p>“Quick… Quick… Quick livestream… This will make an exclusive headline…”</p>
<p>Soon, everyone in the Federation watched the livestream in surprise. They couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign… is attacking the Holy Land… Isn’t this too ridiculous…”</p>
<p>“He has inflated! Egg Sovereign has really inflated! Although his Companion Beasts are very ferocious, a place like the Holy Land definitely can’t be defeated with one or two Companion Beasts. What’s the difference between that and suicide?”</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone broke out into a flurry of discussion. Ordinary people believed that Egg Sovereign was attacking the Holy Land, but the truly discerning bigwigs knew that Zhou Wen was trying to divert the trouble to the Holy Land.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1607'>Chapter 1607 Blocking the Entrance</h3>
<p>The lightning sea was extremely terrifying, but Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Being inside the lightning, Zhou Wen could sense that the power of the Void Salamander’s lightning was weakening at a terrifying speed. This weakening speed was much faster than Zhou Wen imagined. At this speed, it wouldn’t be long before the Void Salamander fell to the Hell level or even the Human Realm. It might even fall to the Terror grade. Zhou Wen saw the Void Salamander’s body distort abnormally as though invisible steel needles had stabbed into its body, causing it to distort in pain.</p>
<p>Even so, the Void Salamander charged at Zhou Wen with all its might, hoping to chomp him to death. It was obvious how much it hated him.</p>
<p>The rules of Earth that suppress creatures alien to Earth are too powerful! Zhou Wen, who should have been happy, wasn’t that happy.</p>
<p>If this had happened previously, Zhou Wen would be very happy. However, he still wanted to use the Void Salamander to camp at the entrance to the Holy Land. If the Void Salamander were to continue weakening, how was it to camp outside?</p>
<p>Any Saint with a Holy Artifact could kill the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Such a Void Salamander definitely didn’t have the capability to hold a siege of the Holy Land’s entrance. Zhou Wen immediately stopped and used spatial teleportation to return to the cosmos.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander also rushed out of Earth and continued pursuing Zhou Wen. After it left Earth, its body rapidly recovered as its lightning powers increased.</p>
<p>“Eh? Why is it gone?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I haven’t had my fill of watching. And that’s it?”</p>
<p>“I knew it. No matter how impressive Egg Sovereign is, he’s still far inferior to the Holy Land. So it’s just a feint.”</p>
<p>“It’s already impressive that he dares fire a shot at the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“Bring Old K and Jiuyang back immediately. No matter what, we have to track Zhou Wen. I want his life.” Holy God’s eyes were cold.</p>
<p>Ever since the establishment of the Holy Land, no one had dared to do such a thing at the Holy Land’s entrance. Zhou Wen’s actions were equivalent to trampling all over the Holy Land’s reputation. Although it didn’t affect the Holy Land itself, its lofty status in the hearts of humans had been trampled. “Lord Holy God, even if I bring Jiuyang and Old K back, it won’t be easy to track Zhou Wen again.” Xiao thought to himself, That punk really has a death wish. He actually came to the Holy Land to cause trouble. Thankfully, he knew better and ran fast.</p>
<p>Holy God naturally knew that it would probably be very difficult to capture Zhou Wen. They succeeded when he left the dimensional zone. It was almost impossible to capture him now. What puzzled Holy God even more was that he had already tried a few times to predict Zhou Wen’s whereabouts, but he had failed to predict anything. It was as though everything about Zhou Wen had nothing to do with this world. This was almost impossible. Any creature that lived in the universe would definitely have a connection with this universe. He would definitely be able to discover something through this connection if it existed.</p>
<p>In this aspect, Holy God was an expert. However, he couldn’t predict anything related to Zhou Wen. He couldn’t even sense Zhou Wen’s connection to the world.</p>
<p>Typically, when such a situation happened, it meant that the other party’s strength was far above Holy God’s. He could forcefully conceal his connection with the world, preventing Holy God from prying into his secrets.</p>
<p>However, those capable of doing so were all bigwigs at the Apocalypse grade. There was no such existence on Earth at present.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly couldn’t be an Apocalypse-grade bigwig. Then, the most likely possibility was that there was something on him that blocked his connection with this world.</p>
<p>After some thought, the anger in Holy God’s heart gradually calmed down. He knew that Xiao was right. It was useless for them to chase after Zhou Wen now. They should first set up a trap. When it was time to pull in the net, Zhou Wen would have nowhere to run. All he could do was bow his head and die.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As Holy God was thinking, he suddenly heard a loud boom followed by continuous thunderclaps.</p>
<p>Holy God and Xiao were stunned as they instantly realized what had happened. Through the spirit mirror, they looked at the entrance of the Holy Land and saw that there was another sea of lightning at the entrance. Zhou Wen, who was protected by the Chaos Egg, was floating above the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>It was as though the same old scene was being replayed. The Void Salamander used void lightning to constantly bombard the area near the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>This b*stard! Xiao was alarmed. He never expected Zhou Wen to dare return.</p>
<p>Xiao felt like cursing. It wasn’t easy for him to dispel Holy God’s determination to do an all-out pursuit of Zhou Wen, but to his surprise, Zhou Wen had repeated his actions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Xiao. Many people watching the livestream also thought that it was about to end. Even the livestream was about to be switched to something else. To their surprise, something unexpected happened again.</p>
<p>“Heavens, Egg Sovereign has returned with that terrifying Companion Beast!”</p>
<p>“What’s he up to?” “Don’t tell me he really wants to fight the Holy Land to the death?”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely not a fight to the death. If so, he wouldn’t have retreated just now.”</p>
<p>“What do you know? This is the strategy of great leaders in ancient times. When the enemy advances, we retreat. When the enemy retreats, we advance. It’s called guerrilla warfare.”</p>
<p>Everyone became excited again. Everyone had mixed feelings about the Holy Land. In the beginning, humans had almost treated the Holy Land as a true holy land in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, in this era, people no longer had the same faith in the Holy Land. They gradually realized that the Holy Land had always enslaved humans and controlled the Federation.</p>
<p>However, as the Holy Land had reigned over humans for too long, even if there was some animosity in their hearts, very few people dared to challenge the Holy Land’s authority.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s current actions were equivalent to doing something countless humans wanted but didn’t dare do. The agreement was far more important than the outcome.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen circled the cosmos with the Void Salamander. After it recovered, he lured it back to Earth.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander’s void lightning constantly struck the teleportation nexus, leaving charred marks everywhere. Although it wasn’t damaged, tiny cracks had already appeared. Zhou Wen didn’t insist on staying. Moments later, he returned to the cosmos and lured the restrained Void Salamander back.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen!” Holy God’s eyes were extremely cold as though they were about to emit a cold aura.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the next second, Zhou Wen and the Void Salamander appeared again. The lightning enveloped the Holy Land’s entrance again.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The extremely hard and almost invulnerable teleportation nexus cracked under the bombardment of the void lightning.</p>
<p>“Bring Old K and Jiuyang back immediately.” Holy God’s voice seemed to be squeezed out from between his gritted teeth.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1608'>Chapter 1608: Attention from Everyone</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Immediately.” Xiao accepted the order and left the Holy Land to bring Jiuyang and Old K back.</p>
<p>Xiao, who had the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple, was good at spatial travel, while Jiuyang and Old K weren’t adept at such powers. After separating from each other at the Big Dipper, they didn’t immediately return.</p>
<p>Before Xiao left Earth, he glanced at Zhou Wen and the Void Salamander who had returned to Earth before thinking to himself, Perhaps the hooha Zhou Wen made is an opportunity.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Xiao used spatial teleportation to return to the Big Dipper to search for Jiuyang and Old K.</p>
<p>Currently, they were the only three humans in the Holy Land who could use Holy Artifacts. Although there were existences stronger than them in the Holy Land, they weren’t humans. It was impossible for them to leave the Holy Land to fight.</p>
<p>“Xiao, what’s wrong with you? Why did you flee without us?” Old K said angrily when he saw Xiao.</p>
<p>“Twas just trying to catch up to Zhou Wen. I thought I might be able to trap him again,” Xiao explained.</p>
<p>“So? What happened” Old K asked.</p>
<p>Xiao shrugged and said, “Of course I didn’t catch up. Therefore, I returned to the Holy Land and reported the situation to Lord Holy God.”</p>
<p>“Humph, what’s the point?” Old K snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“It was indeed useless, but Zhou Wen came knocking on our door,” Xiao said unhurriedly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Old K frowned.</p>
<p>Xiao roughly recounted how Zhou Wen had attacked the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus with the Void Salamander. Then, he said, “Cut the crap. We don’t have time to waste. We have to quickly find Jiuyang and return to stop Zhou Wen. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome for us to enter the Holy Land if</p>
<p>the teleportation nexus is destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Of all the options available to him, he took that? I definitely won’t give him another chance again,” Old K said coldly.</p>
<p>“Wait for me here. I’l find Jiuyang first before returning to take you back.” As Xiao spoke, his figure flashed and vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen once again returned to the Holy Land with the Void Salamander. The void lightning followed closely behind, leaving the teleportation nexus cracking.</p>
<p>The foundation of the teleportation nexus had already cracked as rubble constantly shattered amidst the lightning. The entire teleportation nexus would collapse if this continued.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Void Salamander was greatly suppressed by Earth’s rules. It could only stay on Earth for a few seconds each time. As time passed, its strength decreased drastically. The weakened void lightning couldn’t damage the foundation of the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured the Void Salamander into destroying the teleportation nexus again and again because he realized that only the Void Salamander’s void lightning could truly destroy the teleportation nexus’s comerstone.</p>
<p>Even the Golden Wyrm Scissors couldn’t damage the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>This didn’t mean that the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ destructive power wasn’t strong. The Golden Wyrm Scissors could tear open the cornerstones, but the cornerstones would quickly recover. The cornerstones that were destroyed by the void lightning would shatter without being restored.</p>
<p>The power of the Void Salamander looked like lightning, but in fact, it was the power of the void at a deeper level. It wasn’t an ordinary electric current—the reason why it could destroy the foundation of the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only wanted to destroy the teleportation nexus and prevent the Saints from easily coming out. In the future, it would be difficult for them to return to the Holy Land if they headed out of the Holy Land to plunder resources.</p>
<p>Even if there was another way out for the Holy Land, it at least allowed him to vent his anger.</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is blowing up the entrance to the Holy Land!”</p>
<p>“If the teleportation nexus is really destroyed, will the Saints in the Holy Land and the dimensional creatures in the Holy Temple ever come out again?”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign is heaven-defying. None of the Saints has dared to come out despite him bombarding the Holy Land’s entrance for so long.”</p>
<p>“The Holy Land doesn’t look as terrifying as we imagined. Look at them staying silent while Egg Sovereign does this.”</p>
<p>“The Void Salamander is just too powerful!”</p>
<p>“The Sovereign Egg hasn’t released the Tiger Soul General yet.”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen couldn’t do anything to the Holy Land, he had erased the lofty image and fear that the Holy Land had left in the hearts of humans for so many years.</p>
<p>“This fellow, Zhou Wen, isn’t just slapping the Holy Land in the face, but ripping its mouth apart,” Xia Liuchuan said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Tm just afraid that he won’t be able to leave again if he doesn’t leave now.” Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t that optimistic. He knew the power of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>After all, the six families had once served the Holy Land. They knew a little about the place.</p>
<p>“Should we do something?” Xia Liuchuan asked Zhang Chunqiu.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and nodded. “Make some preparations. Perhaps we can help Zhou Wen at a critical moment. If Zhou Wen can really destroy the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus, it will be a boon to us.”</p>
<p>“What other preparations are needed? Haven’t we been making preparations all these years?” Xia Liuchuan’s eyes burned. The six families had been silent all this time, digesting the resources brought to them by the rapid changes in this world.</p>
<p>“Don’t do anything rash. Our present strength isn’t enough to fight the Holy Land head-on. We will only be helping Zhou Wen when necessary.” Zhang Chungqiu glared at Xia Liuchuan, peeved.</p>
<p>He had the best relationship with Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge. Among the trio, Dugu Ge was especially self-centered. He was more staid and restrained. Xia Liuchuan was the most radical. At the brink of death, he could often erupt with unimaginable potential.</p>
<p>However, it was also because of his personality with a propensity of doing radical things that only Zhang Chunqiu could restrain Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>“When can we fight those fellows head-on?” Xia Liuchuan said gloomily.</p>
<p>“When you can block the entrance of the Holy Land like Zhou Wen and have nobody daring to come out,” Zhang Chunqiu said.</p>
<p>“I’d better make preparations.” Xia Liuchuan tured around and left.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan knew that he couldn’t block the entrance to the Holy Land. He wasn’t afraid of those Saints. He was confident that he could fight even existences like Xiao and Jiuyang.</p>
<p>However, those Saints had Holy Artifacts in their hands and they were inhumanly powerful.</p>
<p>“Stay sharp.” Xia Liuchuan gathered all the Mythical Serum experts that the Xia family had secretly nurtured in the past few years.</p>
<p>Typically, when people used Mythical Serums, they would use whatever Mythical Serum was most compatible with them.</p>
<p>However, the Xia family was different. The Xia family members would categorize different talented people and use a specific Mythical Serum. When they advanced to the Mythical stage, they wouldn’t use whatever Mythical Serum they liked, but the kind of Mythical Serum the Xia family needed.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it was a huge sacrifice. Many Xia family members failed to use their talent to the best of their abilities, nor did they use the most compatible Mythical Serum.</p>
<p>However, when the Xia family was together, the power they erupted was far beyond what ordinary people could imagine.</p>

<p>Why is this teleportation nexus so resilient? Zhou Wen had already used the Void Salamander to strike seven or eight times, but only a portion of the teleportation nexus’s foundation was destroyed. Its main body remained.</p>
<p>‘When Zhou Wen returned to the Holy Land, he immediately realized that something was amiss. At the instant he appeared, the surrounding space distorted as a strange invisible domain power enveloped him.</p>
<p>Old K, Jiuyang, and Xiao appeared not far away. Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened.</p>
<p>However, since Zhou Wen dared to be here, he had already thought of a solution. He wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you will definitely die today for daring to destroy the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus,” Old K said coldly as he raised the scepter in his hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the satellites could only capture the scene, but it was difficult to capture sounds from afar. The people watching the livestream couldn’t hear what Old K was saying. They only knew that the Holy Land had finally sent someone.</p>
<p>“That’s Jiuyang! The other two Saints’ identities don’t seem to be inferior to Jiuyang’s. Their strength shouldn’t be too different, right?”</p>
<p>“One Jiuyang isn’t much weaker than Egg Sovereign. Now that three have appeared, Egg Sovereign is in danger.”</p>
<p>“That might not be the case. Egg Sovereign’s Tiger Soul General hasn’t been released. It’s hard to say who’s stronger.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly. Su Yi and Professor Gu were also commentating. Su Yi asked, “Professor Gu, a Saint has finally appeared. What do you think of Egg Sovereign’s chances of winning?”</p>
<p>Professor Gu cleared his throat and said, “From the previous battle, the difference in strength between Jiuyang and Egg Sovereign isn’t too great. If the other two Saints aren’t weaker than Jiuyang, Egg Sovereign will probably be in danger this time.”</p>
<p>“Since Professor Gu says that Egg Sovereign is in danger, it means Egg Sovereign should be safe.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Lwas still worried about Egg Sovereign just now. After hearing Professor Gu’s analysis, I feel a lot more at ease.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t we agree not to utilize the weapon of mass destruction—Professor Gu? Why are we using it now? Those Saints are really unlucky.”</p>
<p>The screen was filled with such optimistic comments. Professor Gu’s face immediately warped when he saw them.</p>
<p>“From the battle just now, Egg Sovereign should be proficient in spatial teleportation. It shouldn’t be that easy for those Saints to attack him, right?” Su Yi said.</p>
<p>Professor Gu said expressionlessly, “From a professional point of view, it’s impossible that the Holy Land doesn’t know that Egg Sovereign is good at spatial teleportation. Since they sent Saints, they naturally have a solution. If Zhou Wen were to retreat now, he might still have a chance of escaping. It</p>
<p>would probably be too late if he waits any longer.”</p>
<p>“It’s set! It’s set! Professor Gu just gave his blessings. Egg Sovereign is going to be invincible.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Sir, with your words, I think the Holy Land has already lost.”</p>
<p>‘There were all kinds of optimistic comments on the screen, leaving Professor Gu’s face livid and pale. He was so angry that he stopped talking.</p>
<p>In fact, all of his analysis couldn’t be said to be completely without reason. In fact, there was some evidence. He wasn’t randomly spouting nonsense, but in the end, he was teased by the netizens, making him feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt regretful. Although he had already thought of a way to break through the encirclement of Old K and Xiao’s domains, he could only escape. It was impossible for him to continue bombarding the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Til come again in the future. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Just as he was about to rush out, he suddenly heard a voice not far away.</p>
<p>“Do Saints like to bully others with numbers?” A three-sail ship flew over from the distant sky. On the bow was a man.</p>
<p>The man wore a white robe and held an ancient sword in his arms. He sat casually at the bow of the ship with the ancient sword in one hand and a small teapot in the other. After he finished speaking, he took a sip.</p>
<p>The white robe on his body fluttered with the wind. On his back was the word “Ya.”</p>
<p>“It’s Ya… Why is he here…” Although the people watching the livestream couldn’t hear what Ya was saying, they recognized him at a glance.</p>
<p>“Ya doesn’t have a grudge against Egg Sovereign, right? He won’t help those Saints, right?”</p>
<p>“Ya hates Guardians the most. How can he help the Holy Land? He must be here to help Egg Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Eh… There seems to be someone over there…”</p>
<p>On the other side of the screen, something seemed to be approaching.</p>
<p>“Quick, look over there. It looks like… Immortal…”</p>
<p>The scene changed a little. Indeed, on the other side, a person was riding the wind and walking through the void as though he was stepping on invisible stairs.</p>
<p>He walked very slowly, but in the blink of an eye, he arrived near the battlefield. It was none other than Immortal from the League of Guardians.</p>
<p>“Why is Immortal here? The League of Guardians is a lackey of the dimension. He must be here to help those Saints kill Egg Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Loriginally thought that with Ya’s help, Egg Sovereign might still have a chance of survival. I never expected the League of Guardians’ Immortal to come. They should be archenemies, right?”</p>
<p>‘As everyone was discussing, they saw Ya carry the ancient sword on his shoulder and suddenly leap up. He tore through the air and rushed into the domain, blocking Old K and company. He said indifferently, “Junior Brother, leave these three to me. Continue doing what you want to do.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>‘When Ya said this, he used some special power to make his voice sound even louder than the void lightning. Even the program team filming hundreds of kilometers away captured his voice.</p>
<p>The people watching the livestream immediately broke out into an uproar when they heard that. Holy sh*t, Egg Sovereign is actually Ya’s junior brother. So he’s from the Holy Spirit Association!</p>
<p>“Is the Holy Spirit Association that strong now? Ya’s junior brother is so powerful. Then, how strong is Ya now?”</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate!” Old K’s expression darkened as he pointed the scepter in his hand. It immediately transformed into terrifying ripples that swept towards Ya like a huge wave.</p>
<p>Before Ya could take action, a petal fell. Wherever the petal passed, the huge waves instantly vanished.</p>
<p>Immortal walked over step by step with a flower between his fingers. The petal had dropped from the withered flower.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s going on? Immortal is actually here to help Egg Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Aren’t the League of Guardians and those fellows from the Holy Land in cahoots?</p>
<p>“Immortal, do you know what you’re doing? Don’t think that you can be presumptuous here just because the Immortals are backing you,” Old K said coldly as he stared at Immortal.</p>
<p>“Of course I know what I’m doing. I don’t want to interfere in your matters, but who asked you to harm my junior brother?” Immortal said indifferently.</p>
<p>Immortal also used some special power to say those words. Although his voice was gentle, it was extremely clear amidst the rumbling thunder. Everyone in the distance could hear him clearly.</p>
<p>“No way! Could Immortal be Egg Sovereign’s senior brother?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make sense. Aren’t Immortal and Ya archenemies? How can Egg Sovereign be their junior brother at the same time?”</p>
<p>“There must be a mistake somewhere!”</p>
<p>Everyone’s mouths gaped open. They immediately thought that their ears were damaged. They must have heard wrongly or were suffering from auditory hallucinations.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1610'>Chapter 1610: Taiji Symbol</h3>

<p>“So what if it’s Immortal and Ya? With the double domains of Trajectory and Imperial authority, all of them will be trapped here regardless of the numbers,” Old K snorted disdainfully.</p>
<p>The Imperial Authority’s domain restricted one’s body and the Trajectory domain limited space. With both domains in action, even Zhou Wen, who was good at spatial powers, couldn’t break through.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also because Zhou Wen’s spatial powers hadn’t reached the Calamity grade. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be in such a disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>Although Ya and Immortal were very strong, it was also difficult for them to break through the double domains. Even if they entered the battlefield, they would also end up trapped.</p>
<p>The petals on the flower in Immortal’s hand withered and flew towards Old K and company.</p>
<p>However, the petals seemed to fall into a maze. They were clearly flying towards Old K and company, but halfway through, they strangely appeared in different spots. They floated and circled around, but they were unable to approach Old K and company.</p>
<p>Ya pulled out Primordial Immortal Sword and slashed at Old K. The flaming sword beam clearly slashed at Xiao, but it strangely curved and changed directions.</p>
<p>“Te said it before. It’s useless no matter how many people there are. How can the power of the Holy Land be something ordinary people like you can reach?” Old K said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“The power of the Holy Land might not be that impressive. As a mortal, | insist on challenging it.” A voice suddenly sounded as a figure appeared on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, who’s that b*stard?” Some of the spectators couldn’t help but cry out when they saw the person’s appearance.</p>
<p>The person was wearing a white shirt and a tailcoat. He wore a top hat and a monocle. He held a cane in his hand.</p>
<p>He didn’t look like he was here to fight. No matter how one looked at it, he looked like a coquettish youth who had sneaked into a high society banquet and wanted to pick up girls.</p>
<p>“You don’t even know him? That’s Thief Sage who’s as famous as Deceit King.”</p>
<p>“Thief Sage looks like this? My youth has been destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Why did Thief Sage suddenly come here… Don’t tell me he has something to do with Egg Sovereign?”</p>
<p>As everyone was guessing, they heard Liu Yun say in all seriousness, “Junior Brothers, don’t worry. With your Eldest Senior Brother here, a mere spatial zone isn’t a problem.”</p>
<p>Liu Yun deliberately projected his voice. Once his words were broadcast online, it immediately caused a commotion.</p>
<p>“Thief Sage is Egg Sovereign and the others’ eldest senior brother? For real?”</p>
<p>“No way. These people are actually fellow disciples?”</p>
<p>“This spans way too f*cking much. Immortal and Ya have always been rivals. Thief Sage has always been a loner. They are actually fellow disciples? Then were all those things that happened in the past just an act?”</p>
<p>“So what if they are fellow disciples? Isn’t it common for fellow disciples who graduated from the same school to fight to the death on the battlefield?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s not a big deal being fellow disciples, but to make people like Ya, Immortal, and Thief Sage become enemies with the Holy Land for him, I’m increasingly curious as to who Egg Sovereign is.”</p>
<p>“Egg Sovereign sure has good social relations!”</p>
<p>“Pui! What do you mean popular? He’s just a social butterfly.”</p>
<p>As people spoke, Liu Yun summoned a strange Companion Beast. It looked like an ancient mirror, but it wasn’t flat.</p>
<p>In the middle of the item was a Taiji symbol. Outside it was the Eight Trigrams, Seven Stars, Five Elements, and other symbols. The Taiji symbol constantly spun, and the Eight Trigrams was in constant flux, forming a three-dimensional image.</p>
<p>Liu Yun held the strange object as his Essence Energy circulated, immediately returning the distorted space around him to normal. Xiao’s spatial domain seemed to lose its effect.</p>
<p>“No good! Kill Thief Sage first.” Old K’s expression changed as he pointed the scepter at Liu Yun.</p>
<p>A petal floated down and landed on his scepter, forcefully pressing it down. Immortal’s figure appeared in front of Old K.</p>
<p>Ya also blocked Jiuyang who started charging forward.</p>
<p>“You are also an expert at spatial manipulation. From the looks of it, we need to decide on who’s better between us.” Liu Yun faced Xiao and raised the strange Companion Beast in front of him.</p>
<p>“That’s the Taiji Symbol, right?” Xiao sized up the strange Companion Beast in Liu Yun’s hand and asked.</p>
<p>“You sure are knowledgeable. You know that this is a Taiji Symbol. Since you know the Taiji Symbol, why don’t you quickly escape? On account of your good acumen, I’l let you live.” Liu Yun held the Taiji Symbol as though he was number one in the world.</p>
<p>“What a pity. That’s only a Calamity-grade Taiji Symbol. It’s only a Hell-level Companion Beast that hasn’t even reached the Heaven level. To think that a Hell-level Companion Beast can actually fight my Heaven-level Trajectory Zone. It does live up to its reputation. Unfortunately, it entrusted itself to</p>
<p>the wrong person. What a pity,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“You’re f*cking not even a person.” Liu Yun suddenly raised the Taiji Symbol in his hand and aimed it at Xiao, immediately distorting the space in front of him.</p>
<p>Xiao took a step forward and strangely vanished. However, he appeared behind Liu Yun and slashed his fingers at the back of his neck like a blade.</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s pupils constricted as he instant transmitted out. However, a long wound had been left behind as blood stained his white shirt.</p>
<p>“You… are still far from it…” Xiao said indifferently as he moved his feet as though he was taking a stroll. His figure strangely appeared in different spots.</p>
<p>He was standing in front of Liu Yun moments ago, but he appeared behind him after taking one step. With another step, he appeared on Liu Yun’s left.</p>
<p>Liu Yun constantly instant transmitted. At the same time, he wanted to use the Taiji Symbol to capture Xiao, but he couldn’t lock onto Xiao’s location.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Old K and Immortal, Jiuyang, and Ya began fighting.</p>
<p>Seeing that they had blocked Old K and company and the spatial domain’s lock had been removed, Zhou Wen teleported into the cosmos with the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Only the power of the Void Salamander could shatter the foundation of the teleportation nexus. Ya and Immortal were most likely here to help Zhou Wen destroy the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured the Void Salamander and struck the teleportation nexus again and again. As for the battle happening around him, it had already reached a climax.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was crushed by Xiao unilaterally. His suit was tattered and his white shirt was dyed blood-red.</p>
<p>If not for the Taiji Symbol in hand, Xiao would have been killed long ago.</p>
<p>Immortal and Ya’s situation wasn’t much better. Clearly, they hadn’t reached the Heaven level and were at a disadvantage in battle.</p>
<p>Immortal’s situation was slightly better. He had two Guardians. Although he hadn’t reached the Heaven level, his Strength and Speed weren’t much different. For the time being, he could still circle around Old K and hold him back, preventing him from escaping his reach.</p>
<p>Ya’s situation wasn’t good. His sword was too arrogant and stubborn, and Jiuyang was also exemplary when it came to head-on combat. The two of them fought head-on.</p>
<p>Ya’s sword became faster and faster as it became increasingly relentless. However, when facing Jiuyang, it was suppressed time and time again. His Strength and Speed were inferior.</p>
<p>Blood had already seeped out of Ya’s mouth. The flesh between his thumb and index finger had ruptured from holding the sword, but he had no intention of stopping or dodging..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1611'>Chapter 1611: I’m Thief Sage</h3>

<p>“The sun is the source of life. All life is born from the power of the sun. No matter how strong you are, it’s impossible for you to be an enemy of the sun. This is because your strength originates from the sun.” Jiuyang struck out again and again, suppressing Zhong Ziya, preventing him from slashing out</p>
<p>with his sword.</p>
<p>“So what if I’m born because of the sun? If parents give birth to children, do children have to be inferior to their parents? Tempered steel is born from iron ores, but when forged into sabers and swords, it can slice through iron like mud… Ignoring the fact that the sun might not be the source of all life,</p>
<p>even if it is… Iwill defy the heavens and slay the source…” Zhong Ziya’s eyes were like a sword as the sword intent on his body constantly erupted. The sword beam from Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>“Not a bad idea and you are brave. Unfortunately, it’s still lacking the necessary oomph.” Jiuyang’s palms were like the palms of Buddha of the Great Sun. No matter how powerful Zhong Ziya’s sword moves were, they were suppressed.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>‘The sword beam was suppressed by the sun-like palm force as it shattered like glass. The sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand was pressed down inch by inch as blood spewed out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s palm crushed Zhong Ziya’s entire body.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed, but in the blink of an eye, Zhong Ziya’s figure appeared elsewhere with the Primordial Immortal Sword in his arms. He was uninjured, as though everything that had happened was an illusion.</p>
<p>“What kind of oomph do you want? Sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, or salty?” As Zhong Ziya spoke, he moved, leaving behind afterimages.</p>
<p>No, instead of calling them afterimages, they were actually identical to Zhong Ziya’s original body. It was impossible to tell which was the real Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>The five replicas of Zhong Ziya drew their swords and charged at Jiuyang. The sword beams crisscrossed, each more ferocious than the last.</p>
<p>Jiuyang opened his palms and blocked the attacks of all five Zhong Ziyas.</p>
<p>The five Zhong Ziyas were clearly not as simple as illusions. Their powers were real, identical to Zhong Ziya’s true body. It was impossible to tell which was Zhong Ziya’s true body.</p>
<p>“An ugly piece of work has zero value no matter how many times you replicate it.” Jiuyang only had two hands that used moves so simple that anyone could understand; yet, he still suppressed Zhong Ziya and shattered his avatars one after another.</p>
<p>“Replicas indeed have no value, but the paintings used for practice are different. Perhaps in your eyes, every painting is ugly, but no matter how great a painting is, it’s built on this ugliness…” Zhong Ziya’s figure blinked as his avatars appeared like ghosts and charged at Jiuyang from different corners.</p>
<p>“That depends on who the artist is. Not everyone has the potential of a master. Do you?” Jiuyang said indifferently.</p>
<p>“I don’t. I only know how to kill,” the Zhong Ziyas that filled the sky like ghosts answered in unison. Sword beams overlapped and crisscrossed like a net as they enveloped Jiuyang from all directions.</p>
<p>“That’s why you’re still lacking the oomph.” Jiuyang stood like a Buddha as he raised his palm. Like the rising sun, he melted the sword beams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Immortal and Old K’s battle continued.</p>
<p>The scepter in Old K’s hand released the power of Imperial Authority again and again, hoping to restrain Immortal’s body. However, Immortal’s movement technique was ethereal. The power of Imperial authority was ultimately unable to restrain his body.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan didn’t seem to have any intention of killing Old K either. All he did was casually circle around Old K. Old K felt that Jiang Yan would grab his weakness and deliver a fatal strike if he didn’t attack. But if he did, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to Jiang Yan. With Jiang Yan holding him back, he</p>
<p>couldn’t help the rest.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was most tragic. He clearly hadn’t reached the same level as Xiao. They also had spatial powers, so he was almost at Xiao’s mercy.</p>
<p>It was only with the deterrence of the Taiji Symbol that he could barely last until now.</p>
<p>His clothes were almost drenched in blood, but for some reason, he didn’t use any armor-type Companion Beasts, nor did he summon a Guardian.</p>
<p>“F*ck, Eldest Senior Brother Thief Sage is too miserable!”</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother, run!”</p>
<p>The people watching the livestream couldn’t see the details of the battle, but they would see a pause when Liu Yun phased into existence. Xiao’s figure would slide past Liu Yun like a ghost, leaving a new wound on him.</p>
<p>“Your spatial powers are too inferior. If that’s considered spatial powers, then your spatial powers are at most a child’s toy model of a world,” Xiao said disdainfully as he left another wound on Liu Yun’s body.</p>
<p>Liu Yun waved the Taiji Symbol in his hand and shone it in the direction of Xiao’s voice, but there was no sign of Xiao.</p>
<p>“Xiao, ignore that fellow. Stop Zhou Wen first. We can’t let him chip away at the teleportation nexus further,” Old K shouted.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Xiao agreed and took a step forward before disappearing. He dodged the power of the Taiji Symbol and headed for the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>However, Liu Yun’s figure instant transmitted in front of Xiao and threw the Taiji Symbol at him.</p>
<p>The Taiji Symbol emitted a strange power in the air, sweeping everything around it into its interior as though it wanted to devour space.</p>
<p>Xiao’s figure flashed as he dodged the Taiji Symbol’s sweep. However, as the instant Xiao dodged, Liu Yun instant transmitted in front of him and smashed his hand at Xiao’s face.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao and Liu Yun had fought before. Liu Yun’s fist missed and slid past Xiao’s cheek. As for Xiao’s palm, it penetrated Liu Yun’s chest, right through his heart.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be my enemy.” Xiao flicked the blood from his palm and turned to head for the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Brother!” Upon seeing this scene, the people in front of the livestream couldn’t help but cry out.</p>
<p>Some sentimental women covered their mouths with their hands as tears welled in their eyes.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the gown and shirt around Liu Yun’s body shattered and turned to ashes, revealing Liu Yun’s naked body. However, there were no injuries on his upper body.</p>
<p>Clearly, the tuxedo was some special Companion Beast which had suffered the injuries on Liu Yun’s behalf.</p>
<p>“I’s not a big deal to be your enemy.” Liu Yun extended his left hand. In between his fingers was a ring made of thin silk.</p>
<p>Xiao’s strength quickly dissipated and he dropped to the Hell level as though he had lost some kind of augmentation.</p>
<p>“You’re good.” Xiao’s pupils constricted slightly as he turned around and looked at the ring in Liu Yun’s hand.</p>
<p>“Although I’m not your match, don’t forget that my nickname is Thief Sage.” Liu Yun held the ring in one hand and the Taiji Symbol in the other. He said smugly, “Without the Holy Artifact, you’re only at the Hell level.. What right do you have to show off your superiority in front of me?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1612'>Chapter 1612: Shatter!</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Whether there’s a Holy Artifact or not has nothing to do with my sense of superiority.” Xiao’s figure shook like a wandering soul as he suddenly appeared in front of Liu Yun, his nose just inches from Liu Yun’s nose.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was alarmed. It was too late for him to instant transmit. The Taiji Symbol that had just released its power in another direction couldn’t be returned immediately.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao punched Liu Yun’s abdomen, bending his body immediately like a shrimp before sending him flying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had already donned Companion Beast armor. The armor seemed to provide good defence; Xiao’s punch only shattered the armor protecting his abdomen.</p>
<p>Before Liu Yun could stop flying, Xiao had already flashed above his head. His leg was like a saber as he chopped down at Liu Yun’s head.</p>
<p>Liu Yun tried his best to control his body as he waved his hand and shone the Taiji Symbol at Xiao.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Liu Yun was alarmed to discover that Xiao, who had clearly chopped down with his leg, seemed to undergo spatial dislocation.</p>
<p>The Taiji Symbol hit nothing, but Xiao’s leg struck his chest, shattering Liu Yun’s armor. The bones in his chest seemed to crack as his body was sent smashing into the ground.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Liu Yun’s body blasted a huge crater in the ground and rocks. The rocks were still splattering, but before Liu Yun’s body could come to a rest, Xiao’s figure appeared in front of him again as his knee slammed into his face.</p>
<p>Liu Yun finally reacted. The instant the knee hit his nose, he instant transmitted into the sky. The rocks underground exploded from Xiao’s knee jab like a meteorite hitting a planet.</p>
<p>However, before Liu Yun could heave a sigh of relief, Xiao’s figure appeared behind him like a ghost.</p>
<p>Liu Yun waved the Taiji Symbol in one hand and grabbed at Xiao with the other.</p>
<p>However, just as he attacked, Xiao tumed around and appeared in front of him. He threw a punch at Liu Yun’s face and the helmet fragmented. Liu Yum’s face distorted as he flew diagonally.</p>
<p>“Poor Eldest Senior Brother!” The people watching the battle couldn’t see the battle clearly. However, after the program team released an ultra slow-motion analysis, this thought surfaced in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>Xiao was like an omnipotent and omnipresent god as he brutally beat up Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Liu Yun had stolen Xiao’s Holy Artifact, so his strength only remained at the Hell level. The armor on Liu Yun’s body was very powerful, preventing him from being beaten to death.</p>
<p>“That fellow!” An Tianzuo couldn’t help but shake his head with a bitter smile when he saw Xiao beat up Liu Yun.</p>
<p>“That Xiao is powerful!” Xia Liuchuan’s expression was solemn. He had always felt that the so-called Saints were strong only because they had obtained the resources of the dimension and were augmented by the Holy Artifacts.</p>
<p>Xia Liuchuan didn’t believe that he would lose to any Saint that was at his level. However, Jiuyang and Old K’s performance was already shocking. Xiao was even crazier.</p>
<p>Even if they were at the same level, Xia Liuchuan wasn’t confident of defeating Xiao.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, he didn’t think much of Liu Yun in the beginning. Otherwise, Liu Yun would already be dead. He wouldn’t have had the chance to steal his Holy Artifact.” Zhang Chungiu wore a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Should we attack?” Xia Liuchuan asked.</p>
<p>“It’s too late. We can only hope that Zhou Wen can quickly destroy the teleportation nexus. Otherwise, even if we help, we won’t be able to resolve the actual problem.” Zhang Chungiu had been paying attention to the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Under the repeated bombardment of the void lightning, the teleportation nexus that resembled a black stone pillar was filled with tiny cracks. It looked like it would shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Quickly shatter! Zhou Wen descended with the Void Salamander again as he watched the void lightning strike the teleportation nexus. The pillar’s comerstone, which was clearly covered in cracks, didn’t truly collapse. Only its surface crumbled away slightly.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about himself, but Liu Yun couldn’t hold on any longer. He was about to be beaten to a pulp.</p>
<p>It was only thanks to the Taiji Symbol that he could barely deal with Xiao. Every time, he would sweep the Taiji Symbol at Xiao, preventing him from killing him.</p>
<p>Even so, Liu Yun couldn’t last much longer. If this continued, he would probably die there.</p>
<p>You’re still too naive. Do you really think that the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus can be destroyed so easily? Although the void lightning can injure the teleportation nexus, it’s not that easy to truly destroy it. It will require at least another dozen or so full-strength strikes from the Void Salamander</p>
<p>before it can collapse the foundation. Holy God sneered indifferently.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen no longer has the time. In another three more Void Salamander lightning strikes, Xiao should be able to finish off that human. As long as the Taiji Symbol in the human’s hand loses its effect, everyone there will die. Holy God glanced at Xiao, who was thrashing Liu Yun. He was</p>
<p>somewhat surprised. I never expected Xiao’s strength to reach such a stage. His strength and realm have far exceeded his level. Among the three Holy Sons, he has the best combat abilities. Even Jiuyang, who has reached the Heaven level, is probably no match for him. He’s just a little too proud, but he</p>
<p>does have the right to be proud.</p>
<p>Holy God actually felt somewhat smug looking at Xiao.</p>
<p>After all, Xiao’s present achievements were all thanks to him alone. If he hadn’t taken Xiao to Lake Frustration and allowed Xiao to advance with the power of Lake Frustration, provided Xiao with a large number of dimensional resources, and recommended him to be in charge of the Trajectory Holy</p>
<p>Temple’s Holy Artifact, Xiao wouldn’t have grown strong so quickly.</p>
<p>The greater Xiao’s achievements were, the more glory it meant for Holy God.</p>
<p>Of course, Xiao didn’t obtain all of this for no reason. Holy God had brought him into Lake Frustration and made him use the power of Lake Frustration to advance only to get Xiao to capture the former principal.</p>
<p>Xiao received the subsequent special treatment of the resources and Holy Artifact because he had brought back the former principal.</p>
<p>However, Xiao’s growth far exceeded Holy God’s expectations.</p>
<p>“Shatter!” Zhou Wen descended with the Void Salamander again and couldn’t help but roar.</p>
<p>This was because Liu Yun couldn’t hold on any longer. He was about to be killed. If he couldn’t crack the teleportation nexus, Zhou Wen would have to give up on the idea of destroying the teleportation nexus and help Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Once Liu Yun died, the Taiji Symbol would lose its effect. Immortal and Ya would be trapped here, and the Void Salamander wouldn’t be able to leave. In the end, he still wouldn’t be able to destroy the teleportation nexus. It made things even worse.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one had to make a choice, so this was Zhou Wen’s last attempt. He strongly hoped that he could crack the teleportation nexus’s cornerstone.</p>
<p>Due to his mood, Zhou Wen’s roar was so loud that it was captured for the livestream. Everyone watching the livestream heard the roar.</p>
<p>They seemed to be infected by Zhou Wen’s emotions as many people subconsciously clenched their fists. They prayed inwardly, hoping that the lightning could shatter the teleportation nexus as Egg Sovereign wished.</p>
<p>“shatter!” Many people held their breaths, eager to punch the cornerstone themselves.</p>
<p>Humans like to place their hopes on unrealistic matters. They think that they can resolve all problems with emotions. What a joke. Holy God knew very well that the void lightning couldn’t destroy the teleportation nexus’s foundation.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the instant the void lightning descended, a volcanic eruption-like aurora streaked across the sky and struck the foundation of the teleportation nexus alongside the void lightning.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1613'>Chapter 1613: What happened to Brotherhood?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“Shatter!” With Zhou Wen’s roar, the lightning struck down.</p>
<p>At the same time, a beam streaked across the sky. It resonated at the exact moment Zhou Wen roared as though it was a miracle responding to him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Void lightning struck the teleportation nexus’s cornerstone. Lightning flowed through the cracks, making the cornerstone look like a stone pillar covered in lightning cracks.</p>
<p>Although it looked like it was about to shatter, it didn’t.</p>
<p>However, the beam that accompanied Zhou Wen’s voice struck the cornerstone. The stone pillar that was filled with cracks from the lightning’s invasion suddenly exploded. Light and lightning spewed out from within like huge exploding lightning fireworks.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The huge teleportation nexus’s cornerstone was like a collapsed building. The entire foundation cornerstone shattered into pieces and collapsed. One could sense the terrifying shockwave from as far as 500 kilometers away.</p>
<p>It felt like an earthquake a few hundred kilometers away from the teleportation nexus. The ground churned like waves as rifts opened up on the ground. They crisscrossed like huge spiderwebs.</p>
<p>The barren land instantly turned into ruins.</p>
<p>Looking at the crumbling cornerstone, everyone’s mouths gaped open. There was excitement, anger, doubt, and even more horror.</p>
<p>Holy God stared intently at Zhou Wen and pursed his lips without making a sound. However, the glint in his eyes was chilling.</p>
<p>“What was that beam of light?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that a deity heard Egg Sovereign’s voice and responded to him with a miracle?”</p>
<p>“This is a miracle! Could it be that my Egg Sovereign is a person chosen by the heavens? Even the heavens are helping him.”</p>
<p>Ordinary people really couldn’t think of any creature that could produce such a powerful beam. They believed that it was a miracle.</p>
<p>As for the various factions that were more concerned about the An family, they had already guessed what the beam was.</p>
<p>The An family had shocked the entire Federation when it destroyed Skysplit Tower, but they had never used that terrifying weapon again.</p>
<p>After such a long time, when the forgetful humans were about to forget that terrifying weapon, it revealed its ferociousness again today. The shock it produced was even more direct than before.</p>
<p>‘The Void Salamander’s powerful strength failed to collapse the cornerstone despite bombarding it so many times. However, this single shot shattered it.</p>
<p>‘With such a strong comparison, the shock dealt to the heart was incomparable to the previous time.</p>
<p>Up to now, many people had yet to recover from their shock. This shot was just too shocking.</p>
<p>In fact, this shot wasn’t as terrifying as people imagined. The void lightning had almost destroyed the cornerstone. Cracks had already appeared in its interior, but it was just short of a final push.</p>
<p>It was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. Without this straw, the camel could still last for a period of time, but once this straw was placed on it, the camel would immediately collapse.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only an analogy. The effects of this shot were far stronger than a piece of straw. Its destructive power was no weaker than the void lightning, It produced such an effect by working in concert with the void lightning. Neither was indispensable.</p>
<p>On a mountaintop a few hundred kilometers away from the Holy Land, An Sheng was instructing people to dismantle and distribute the Essence Energy compression accelerator before returning with the parts.</p>
<p>An Sheng didn’t know how this thing was brought there. Before Old K and company appeared, the accelerator had been in Luoyang’s An family. It was impossible to transport such a huge accelerator here in such a short period of time unless one had powerful spatial powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was likely the only spatial expert in the An family capable of this feat. However, Zhou Wen had been fighting all this while, so it was impossible for him to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with An Tianzuo’s temper, it was impossible for him to request Zhou Wen’s help.</p>
<p>An Sheng had some guesses, but he buried them in his heart forever. He didn’t even think about it.</p>
<p>“Retreat!” Zhou Wen had already achieved his goal and wasn’t willing to stay any longer. He wanted to get Zhong Ziya and company to retreat quickly. There was no benefit in continuing the battle, much less truly storming into the Holy Land.</p>
<p>However, when he spoke and looked into the sky, he realized that Immortal’s body had already transformed into countless petals. By the time the petals scattered, he had already vanished.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya only left his avatar on the battlefield. His true body rode his sword and instantly vanished like a meteor.</p>
<p>“What happened to brotherhood?” Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open for a while.</p>
<p>The only tragic one was Liu Yun. His movement technique and escaping abilities were originally the strongest among the three, but he ended up being entangled by Xiao. They were both spatial experts, so Xiao didn’t give him a chance to use spatial teleportation to escape.</p>
<p>After all, Liu Yun was good at close-range instant transmission. Long-distance teleportation wasn’t his forte. He was much weaker than Zhou Wen and needed plenty of time to prepare. Under Xiao’s attacks, there was no time to use long-distance teleportation.</p>
<p>In terms of movement techniques, Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique was even stranger. Furthermore, Xiao was proficient in all sorts of different techniques. He forcefully intercepted Liu Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Yun was half-dead. He barely survived to this moment thanks to the Taiji Symbol. Zhou Wen guessed that Jing Daoxian had most likely helped him obtain the Taiji Symbol.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>‘When Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun, he saw Xiao palm strike Liu Yun in the chest. Liu Yun’s sternum caved in as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Along with the blood spewed out was the Holy Artifact ring that Liu Yun had swallowed in battle.</p>
<p>Xiao reached out to grab the Holy Artifact ring and put it on his finger. His palm didn’t stop; it struck Liu Yun’s head again.</p>
<p>Liu Yun had nowhere to hide. The armor on his body had long shattered and was unable to provide any protection. If Xiao’s palm, augmented by the Holy Artifact, struck him, his entire head would explode.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao’s palm struck down, but it didn’t land on Liu Yun, but the Chaos Egg. The Chaos Egg blocked Xiao’s terrifying palm.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother… You’re finally here…” Liu Yun, who had been beaten to a pulp, was so excited that he was about to cry.</p>
<p>“Leave now. Leave this to me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need for Zhou Wen to say anything. Liu Yun had already instant transmitted away.</p>
<p>Once Liu Yun left, the surrounding space immediately distorted and fault lines appeared after losing the Taiji Symbol’s domain’s restraint on the Trajectory domain. Old K and Jiuyang also surrounded him.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, why did everyone leave? They left Egg Sovereign alone?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they fellow disciples? Isn’t it all about brothers who never abandon each other?”</p>
<p>“Te already said that even brothers can’t be relied on, much less fellow disciples.”</p>
<p>“They escaped way too quickly!”</p>
<p>“That’s quite a sucky situation to be in.. If they escape, leaving Egg Sovereign behind, what will happen to him?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1614'>Chapter 1614 One Against Three</h3>
<p>Xiao, Jiuyang, and Old K had already displayed their powerful strength. Even existences as powerful as Immortal and Ya couldn’t gain any advantage. They were suppressed.</p>
<p>Xiao even thrashed Thief Sage Liu Yun. If the three of them had jointly attacked Zhou Wen previously, people wouldn’t have had a straightforward idea of how strong they were. However, now that there was a comparison, the spectators were alarmed when the three of them attacked Zhou Wen. They couldn’t help but worry for him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you have to pay the price for everything you’ve done.” Old K stared coldly at Zhou Wen as the scepter in his hand emitted an invisible strange fluctuation.</p>
<p>Now that Liu Yun had escaped, it was unlikely he could return. Without the Taiji Symbol’s suppression, Old K and Xiao’s domain powers could restrain Zhou Wen again.</p>
<p>“When did I say I was running?” Zhou Wen said indifferently. He had no intention of running to begin with. Otherwise, he would have run with Liu Yun.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen spoke, the Void Salamander lunged over again. However, this time, it didn’t return to the cosmos to recover. Its strength had been greatly suppressed by Earth’s rules, and could hardly maintain its Hell-level strength.</p>
<p>The void lightning descended as it crazily struck the Chaos Egg. The Void Salamander opened its mouth in a bid to devour Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dodge and allowed the Chaos Egg to be devoured by the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>As the void lightning was too intense, the people watching the livestream only saw the lightning drown Zhou Wen. They didn’t know what was happening inside. However, Old K and company could clearly see that after the Void Salamander devoured Zhou Wen, a saber beam seeped out of its body. It went from its head to its tail as though it had been sliced open from the middle.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander’s lightning body split into two, revealing Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Dragon King armor and holding the Bamboo Blade. As for the Void Salamander’s lightning body, it quickly dissipated, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Only then did the people watching the live broadcast clearly see Zhou Wen’s figure floating in the air. Without the Chaos Egg’s protection and the intense light of the void lightning, everyone could clearly see him. “Deceit King!”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, so Egg Sovereign is Deceit King!”</p>
<p>Everyone immediately recognized Zhou Wen in the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor. Zhou Wen wore the Prisoned Dragon armor as Human Sovereign, and the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor as Deceit King.</p>
<p>The Limitless Demon Dragon King armor had a benefit-it could combine the nine into one. Apart from Zhou Wen himself, Zhou Wen could still borrow the power of eight creatures after putting on the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen had already imprinted the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s mark on eight Companion Beasts. The eight Companion Beast tattoos were shimmering.</p>
<p>However, due to the Dragon King armor’s cover, people couldn’t see the shimmering Companion Beast tattoos. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Soul Mirror, Golden Wyrm Scissors, Truth Listener, and other Companion Beasts… as well as Demonic Neonate’s tattoo shimmered with a demonic glow.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate finally woke up again and returned to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, she had reached the Terror grade.</p>
<p>The power of the eight Companion Beasts had already fused with Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could freely use all their strength for himself.</p>
<p>Among the eight Companion Beasts, Truth Listener contributed the most. Following that were the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Terror-grade Demonic Neonate. Furthermore, among the eight Companion Beasts, only Demonic Neonate wasn’t at the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade as the black crystal-like Dragon King armor emitted a strange black glow. It flickered like flames, sucking all light that approached it.</p>
<p>“I knew it. How could there be so many human experts? So it’s Deceit King. It’s no wonder he’s so good at spatial powers.”</p>
<p>“Deceit King’s Companion Beast is even more impressive than himself!”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. Didn’t Deceit King fight Ya and Immortal? They were actually fellow disciples?”</p>
<p>“This world is so complicated!”</p>
<p>“Even if he’s Deceit King, it’s very dangerous to face the three Saints. Why did he unsummon the Void Salamander?”</p>
<p>“I think Deceit King isn’t as strong as his Companion Beasts, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General are practically invincible. Quickly summon them. They should be able to fight the three Saints. There might even be a chance of defeating them.”</p>
<p>Everyone hoped that Zhou Wen could summon the Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General. Zhou Wen wanted to summon them, but it was impossible.</p>
<p>The Tiger Soul General needed time to grow powerful. It wasn’t suitable for the present situation, so summoning it was useless.</p>
<p>The Void Salamander wasn’t his Companion Beast at all, and he had already killed it. However, Zhou Wen hadn’t hatched the Human Realm Void Salamander Companion Egg. Even if he hatched it, it wouldn’t be of much use in a battle of this level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in hand as his Essence Energy was extremely converged. He stood on the ruins of the teleportation nexus and said to Old K and company, “Didn’t you want to kill me? Bring it on.”</p>
<p>“I’ll fight you,” Jiuyang said as he walked towards Zhou Wen. “Jiuyang, wait. Now isn’t the time to be a hero. The teleportation nexus has been destroyed. Lord Holy God must be furious. We have to kill him. We mustn’t allow any other variabilities.” As Old K spoke, he called out to Xiao. “Xiao, let’s attack together. We definitely can’t let him escape again.” Xiao nodded and surrounded Zhou Wen with Old K. He was puzzled. Zhou Wen clearly had a chance to leave with Liu Yun, so why didn’t he?</p>
<p>What are you trying to do? Xiao was puzzled, but he had no choice but to participate in this battle with Zhou Wen. He had to maintain his identity in the Holy Land and he couldn’t allow himself to be exposed.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it was impossible for Xiao to secretly help Zhou Wen. If he made any abnormal movements, Holy God would definitely notice.</p>
<p>Jiuyang threw a punch at Zhou Wen. His punch was like a scorching sun in the sky, as though it wanted to melt everything. With a thought, Zhou Wen unsheathed the Bamboo Blade in his hand and seemed to fuse with it. His body followed a strange arc as he slashed at Jiuyang.</p>
<p>If Jiuyang was a blazing sun that could incinerate everything, Zhou Wen was an immortal that had ascended in broad daylight. His strike didn’t look fast, but it was elegant as though it was untainted by the mortal world.</p>
<p>The saber didn’t look fast, but it dodged Jiuyang’s fist. The blade traced an arc and slashed at Jiuyang’s throat.</p>
<p>Jiuyang was slightly taken aback. It was clearly a strike that was light and didn’t seem to use much strength, but it made him feel like he couldn’t block or dodge. All he could do was take a step back and make way for the Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Old K and Xiao attacked from both sides, surrounding Zhou Wen from different angles.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, he still hasn’t summoned the Void Salamander and the Tiger Soul General. Could it be that Egg Sovereign… No… Deceit King really wants to rely on that saber to fight the three Saints?”</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts, the spectators were alarmed. Even the top experts of the various factions were no exception.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1615'>Chapter 1615 Analyzing the Video</h3>
<p>Jiuyang palm’s might blotted out the sky. Xiao’s movement technique was bizarre. Old K’s combat techniques were the worst, but the scepter contained some kind of magical power. It could block the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand every time.</p>
<p>The trio besieged Zhou Wen with attacks that left him stifled. Ignoring the ordinary spectators, even existences like Xia Liuchuan, Zhang Chunqiu, and Lance broke out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>They placed themselves in Zhou Wen’s shoes and imagined how they could withstand such attacks. However, no matter how they thought about it, they realized that they would be quickly overwhelmed and killed.</p>
<p>Lance was too engrossed in this enactment. After watching for a while, his face was as pale as snow. In the end, he spat out blood.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the Holy Artifact, the three of them had Strength and Speed that had already reached the Heaven level. Ignoring the trio, just any one of them was not someone most humans could match. Anyone would think that they were doomed to lose if the trio attacked.</p>
<p>However, under the siege of the trio, Zhou Wen’s body was like a flying immortal. He held the saber in his right hand and the scabbard in the left as he fought the trio to a draw.</p>
<p>All the major media outlets were trying their best to analyze the ultra slow-motion video. Ordinary people couldn’t see the battle from the video at all. Only some special equipment could analyze through slow motion.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, the video is still being analyzed. Our level is too low, so we can’t see the battle situation. Can you tell us the current situation?” Su Yi said to Professor Gu.</p>
<p>Professor Gu nudged his glasses and said in a deep voice, “Even Mythical experts can’t see such a battle clearly. I can only analyze it based on some of the available information.”</p>
<p>“Please speak.” Su Yi was also curious about the situation.</p>
<p>Although many people believed that Professor Gu was a jinx whose predictions were always inaccurate, they could only see flashes of light. They had no idea what was going on. Regardless of whether what he said was right or wrong, it was good to hear what he had to say.</p>
<p>O VII.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other than some of Professor Gu’s analysis mistakes, some of his analysis made sense.</p>
<p>Professor Gu cleared his throat and said, “We’ve already seen Deceit King’s combat strength in the previous Cube ranking battle. Later on, many experts did an ultra slow-motion analysis. He indeed has high combat strength; his level is even higher than Immortal and Ya, but he’s still on the same level. He doesn’t have the ability to deliver absolute suppression.”</p>
<p>“We’ve already analyzed a portion of the battle between Immortal and Ya. Their combat strength is actually still a little inferior to the three Saints. In that case, Deceit King’s strength is about the level of a Saint. It might even be superior.”</p>
<p>“Of course, if Deceit King were to use Companion Beasts, the strength of the Void Salamander and the Tiger Soul General would be extremely terrifying. In a one-on-one situation, he shouldn’t be weaker than a Saint. He might even be stronger. However, now that he’s not using Companion Beasts and is only using his own abilities and combat strength, things aren’t looking good.”</p>
<p>“Deceit King has always been smart. Does he have a reason for doing this?” Su Yi asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what plans he has, but everyone has seen the strength of the three Saints. It’s especially so for Xiao. His strength is terrifying. I really can’t think of anyone among humans who is stronger than him. Similarly, he’s proficient in spatial powers. In a one-on-one situation, even Deceit King might not be able to gain the upper hand, much less now when he’s fighting against three. If Deceit King summons a Companion Beast, there’s still a chance. Otherwise, I really can’t think of a chance for him to win.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I believe that it’s definitely a tactic if Deceit King doesn’t summon his Companion Beasts. He will likely summon his Companion Beasts at the critical moment…” Professor Gu continued analyzing. As people listened to Professor Gu’s analysis, they couldn’t help but agree. Although Professor Gu was famous as a jinx, these words reached their hearts. “Professor Gu is right. Deceit King is probably leaving his Companion Beasts as a trump card by not summoning them.” “Professor Gu’s analysis is a little reliable this time.”</p>
<p>“I hope Professor Gu doesn’t jinx it again. The Companion Beasts are definitely a trump card. Deceit King will definitely win.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll support Professor Gu this time.”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Professor Gu’s analysis was right. Looking at the various comments that finally supported him after all this time, Professor Gu was secretly delighted. I should be able to make a comeback this time. I should be able to wipe away the stigma of being a jinx.</p>
<p>Just as Professor Gu was thinking about how to restore his reputation and prestige, Su Yi received the notification from the program team. She said with a look of delight, “Our staff has already analyzed a portion of the video. Although it’s only a portion, according to the technical personnel, it’s already extremely exciting…”</p>
<p>“Cut to the chase. Quickly release the ultra slow-motion analysis!”</p>
<p>“I want to see the video. Please release it quickly.” “Goddess Su Yi, spare me. Quickly release the video, alright? My heart can’t take it!” Su Yi smiled and said, “I know no one wants to hear me now, but the program team is preparing to send the analysis over. Please wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Soon, the program’s scene turned into a battle scene. Under the ultra slow-motion camera, the average audience finally saw the battle scene of Zhou Wen, Xiao, and company. Although the video had been slowed down significantly, the four of them still moved very quickly. Furthermore, as Jiuyang would occasionally emit the Sun God Light, causing the image to be rather inconsistent, the entire scene would often end up white.</p>
<p>From the intermittent scenes, one could tell that the trio was fighting a rather intense battle.</p>
<p>“Pay attention to Jiuyang’s palm. This palm looks simple, but it contains infinite profundity and future variability. Regardless of whether Deceit King defends, attacks, or dodges, Jiuyang’s subsequent changes can make Deceit King suffer… Look at Xiao’s finger… What a terrifying fellow… I can’t even predict where this finger will point… Old K’s sceptre technique is really ingenious… I’m afraid Deceit King will be in trouble next…” Professor Gu constantly explained according to the content displayed in the video. “Look, Deceit King has been pushed into a corner…” Zhou Wen’s projection appeared as Professor Gu hurriedly continued.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t finish his sentence. The smile on his face gradually vanished, replaced by a look of shock.</p>
<p>From the way Jiuyang and company were attacking, Deceit King could only be in a disadvantaged position. He might even be severely injured.</p>
<p>Of course, as the battle was still in progress, Professor Gu knew that Deceit King wasn’t dead. Otherwise, he might even believe that Zhou Wen was doomed if he didn’t summon his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, the content on the screen was the opposite of his explanation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1616'>Chapter 1616 Heaven Man Smite</h3>
<p>Professor Gu was caught up in his excitement explaining, but the scene he saw was far from what he had expected. He couldn’t continue after a few words.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that Deceit King’s situation wouldn’t be good, but from the scene, Deceit King was fighting three alone. He had his saber in his right hand and scabbard in his left while blocking the attacks of the three Saints. Furthermore, he didn’t look to be in trouble at all. His movement techniques were elegant like an immortal’s. Every move he made looked elegant and composed without any signs of being forced. “How is this happening?” Professor Gu was somewhat dumbfounded. It wasn’t just Professor Gu. The audience watching the program was also somewhat dumbfounded. They had already seen the combat strength of Jiuyang and company. Ignoring Jiuyang and Old K, just Xiao alone gave off an unstoppable feeling</p>
<p>They were clearly virtually invincible, but when they fought Zhou Wen, they didn’t show any of the strength and dominance they previously had. Instead, they appeared bounded.</p>
<p>“This is fake, right?”</p>
<p>“Are the three Saints holding back?”</p>
<p>Everyone secretly suspected. The present Xiao, Jiuyang, and Old K didn’t look as impressive as before. It was as though they had turned from invincible kings to amateurs who could only circle around the periphery. Thinking of Xiao’s violent thrashing of Liu Yun, it was difficult not to suspect that they were going easy on Deceit King.</p>
<p>However, truly perceptive experts didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang’s standards didn’t decrease. They even performed better than in the previous battle, but they still failed to suppress Deceit King</p>
<p>Now, Deceit King’s movement technique was extremely bizarre. Under the siege of the trio, he seemed to be walking leisurely. He was neither anxious nor pressed. His body was like the wind as he easily dodged most of the attacks. Even if he couldn’t dodge them, he would block using his Bamboo Blade and scabbard.</p>
<p>The attacks of Jiuyang and company didn’t seem to put any pressure on him at all. Instead, every casual swing of the Deceit King’s saber seemed to give Jiuyang and company immense pressure. They had no choice but to treat it seriously and even retreat. Every strike seemed to target their most feared weakness.</p>
<p>“This person’s saber art has probably reached the point of Heaven Man Smite!” Zhang Chunqiu exclaimed.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Xia Liuchuan didn’t understand what Zhang Chunqiu’s adjective meant.</p>
<p>He knew about Heaven Man Unity, but he had never heard of Heaven Man Smite.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu explained, “You can understand it as a public outrage. Even God can’t stand it and wants to destroy him.”</p>
<p>In Guide City, Li Xuan and company were also watching the battle. Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as his face alternated between worry and joy. At times, he frowned in thought, and at times, he was overjoyed. At times, his face was filled with puzzlement and confusion.</p>
<p>“I originally thought that my saber art was slowly approaching Coach. But from what I’m seeing today, I realize that there’s still a huge gap. From the looks of it, I haven’t worked hard enough,” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Coach, when are you going to use some sword techniques? I really want to see how he uses a sword,” Ming Xiu said.</p>
<p>The female sword immortal, Qin Zhen, fixated her eyes on Zhou Wen, afraid that she would miss any detail.</p>
<p>Among the three of them, she had gained the most insights. This was because she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal to begin with. And now, Zhou Wen had pushed the Immortal in Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits, allowing Qin Zhen to comprehend many things that she had never thought of before.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wasn’t very interested in saber techniques. He only found Zhou Wen’s saber techniques very powerful and his movement techniques very strong. He was elegant and truly like an immortal.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, it looks like Deceit King really doesn’t need to use Companion Beasts, right?” Su Yi’s eyes shimmered as her face was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Although Deceit King’s reputation wasn’t as good as Human Sovereign’s, he was still a representative of humanity. Without a contract with a Guardian, he had no connection to the Holy Land. Su Yi hoped that Deceit King could obtain victory.</p>
<p>“Yes, it does look interesting. Deceit King’s Strength, Speed, and saber arts are surprisingly strong…”</p>
<p>“Cut it out, Professor Gu. I’m willing to confer you the Greatest Jinx of All Heavens.”</p>
<p>“I never expected that. Professor Gu, you’re really impressive.”</p>
<p>“You’re such a jinx… You’re such a jinx… You’re such a jinxed jinx…”</p>
<p>“In the future, if anyone dares to say that Professor Gu isn’t a jinx, I’ll spit in his face.”</p>
<p>“Haha, Professor Gu is innocent. No one expected Deceit King to be this strong. He’s practically a sicko!”</p>
<p>Professor Gu’s nickname of Jinx probably couldn’t be washed away. Zhou Wen could fight the three of them because he had to thank the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor and the eight Companion Beasts. The power the eight Companion Beasts provided him, especially Truth Listener, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, and Demonic Neonate, was unimaginably powerful. With their combined strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength and Speed could almost reach the Heaven level.</p>
<p>Although he had only touched the threshold, Xiao, Jiuyang, and company had also used Holy Artifacts to reach the Heaven level. They were inferior to true Heaven-level existences. They, too, had only touched the threshold. Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen was at the same starting point as the three of them.</p>
<p>To be able to fight three alone, other than giving credit to the mysterious effects of The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain, it was also thanks to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal which had also reached an extremely high realm.</p>
<p>In terms of realm, Transcendent Flying Immortal was no longer inferior to a true Heaven-level existence. Even a top Heaven-level existence might not be stronger than Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the battle continued, Transcendent Flying Immortal continued transforming. His movement techniques and saber techniques became more and more elegant and ghostly. Everyone was alarmed to discover that despite the three Saints besieging Zhou Wen, they felt that the trio were the ones in danger as though they would be killed by him at any moment.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang could still match Zhou Wen in terms of technique and realm, but Old K was lacking in this aspect. He relied on the Holy Artifact—the scepter—to block Zhou Wen’s attack.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had the upper hand, it was still impossible for him to completely break through the trio’s siege. He only had an advantage, not an overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. He was fighting, but also practicing. Transcendent Flying Immortal was transforming. He had already vaguely touched a new realm, but it was only a tiny sliver. It was still unknown if he could fully comprehend it.</p>
<p>Apart from practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal, the Teacher Domain had also been gathering the trajectories of Jiuyang and company’s powers. It was a trajectory that only Heaven-level perfect domains could leave behind in the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Previously, the trajectory left behind by the void lightning had condensed into the Great Void Lightning Art-an Essence Energy Art. Although Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to study it carefully, he knew that it was definitely not bad.</p>
<p>Now, the trajectories left behind by Jiuyang and company were constantly made complete. Perhaps they could condense an Essence Energy Art as well.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1617'>Chapter 1617 Composed</h3>
<p>“Lord Holy God, should we head out and help Jiuyang and the rest?” The Saints knelt on one knee and asked Holy God.</p>
<p>“The teleportation nexus has already been destroyed. How are you going to help them?” Holy God said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Well…” The Saints were rendered speechless.</p>
<p>“Is there nothing you can do, Lord Holy God?” a Saint asked.</p>
<p>“There’s naturally a way, but it’s not that easy to leave. It’s too late now. Besides, even if you are sent out, what can you do with your strength?” Holy God said expressionlessly.</p>
<p>The Saints fell silent. Jiuyang and company were already the cream of the crop among the Saints. They were still unable to defeat Zhou Wen despite being augmented by the Holy Artifacts. Even if they could leave, they wouldn’t be of much use in such a battle. It would even be difficult for them to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>“You think too little of yourself. How can the Saints of the Holy Land only have this little ability? Watch carefully. The show has just begun,” Holy God said with a deep gaze.</p>
<p>Just as Holy God had said, for Jiuyang and company to stand out in the cruel environment of the Holy Land and become the controllers of the Holy Artifact meant that they were no pushovers. Old K used the scepter to block Bamboo Blade and shouted at Jiuyang and Xiao in a deep voice, “At this stage, there’s no need to hold back. If we can’t kill him here today, how can we face Lord Holy God?” His words were fervent, but there was another underlying meaning. In fact, he wanted to tell Jiuyang and Xiao that if they couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, Holy God probably wouldn’t let them off easily even if they returned to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The punishment ranged from having the Holy Artifact confiscated to a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang also knew that the Holy Land was definitely not holy. There was too much cruel competition there. Once they failed, once they made a huge mistake, countless Saints would crawl over their corpses to take their place.</p>
<p>To the six Holy Temples, they weren’t completely irreplaceable. At the very least, not yet.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang exchanged looks as the Sun God Bead in Jiuyang’s arms lit up. His entire body seemed to turn into light as he charged at Zhou Wen with terrifyingly high temperatures.</p>
<p>Previously, although Jiuyang had also emitted the Sun God Light, he had only used powerful destructive power. He didn’t have such terrifyingly high temperatures that could melt</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>On the other side, the ring on Xiao’s finger emitted a strange glow, causing his body to distort strangely. Even his figure was almost indiscernible.</p>
<p>When he attacked Zhou Wen, his figure seemed to distort strangely in space. He clearly looked like he was going one direction, but he would appear in another.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s saber that slashed at Xiao failed to touch him.</p>
<p>Old K tried his best to channel his scepter, but he only managed to make it a little stronger. It didn’t produce any stronger effects.</p>
<p>Even so, it placed Zhou Wen in danger.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>When Bamboo Blade met Jiuyang’s fist, although Bamboo Blade was extremely hard and was only at the Terror grade, it wasn’t inferior to a Calamity-grade weapon. However, it bent under Jiuyang’s fist. Even Zhou Wen’s body was sent retreating. However, once the force dissipated, Bamboo Blade’s blade bounced back.</p>
<p>Xiao’s figure was like a wandering soul as he dodged the scabbard slash that Zhou Wen delivered with his left hand. He stuck close to Zhou Wen, his sharp nails slashing at his neck. Zhou Wen had already tried his best to dodge, but he was still a little slow. The armor around his neck had a deep mark that almost reached Zhou Wen’s skin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt the pressure increase. Xiao and Jiuyang gave him immense trouble.</p>
<p>“Is it still too much? He should be summoning his Companion Beasts, right?” Xia Liuchuan said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Xiao and Jiuyang will probably become our archenemies in the future. I wonder how many Saints like them there are in the Holy Land,” Zhang Chunqiu said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Those Saints all have terrifying talent. I wonder where the Holy Land found so many children to nurture.” Xia Liuchuan thought for a moment and said, “Thankfully, even if they have talent and resources, they might not be able to become true experts. It depends on their beliefs and comprehension. There probably aren’t many Saints like Xiao and Jiuyang in the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“Even if there aren’t many, there are six temples,” Zhang Chunqiu said. “Old K is clearly inferior. If the other Holy Artifacts wielders are like Old K, it will be much easier for us to deal with them,” Xia Liuchuan said.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “Don’t underestimate Old K. Although his combat strength and talent are inferior to Xiao and Jiuyang, strength may not be all that matters. The strength he possesses isn’t primary. His ability to control the overall situation is what he’s good at.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you realize that Old K has been making up for the flaws caused by Xiao and Jiuyang’s attacks?” Zhang Chunqiu glared at Xia Liuchuan.</p>
<p>“Naturally. However, I still think that Xiao and Jiuyang are more terrifying,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu didn’t wish to harp on this problem. As he looked at the satellite’s screen, he muttered to himself, “Let’s see how Zhou Wen plans on dealing with it. Even if he summons a Companion Beast, he might not be able to control it well in such a fast-paced battle.”</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Zhou Wen would summon a Companion Beast at any moment, but after waiting for a while, Zhou Wen still had no intention of summoning one.</p>
<p>And his current situation was deteriorating. Under the crazy siege of the three Saints, wounds constantly appeared on his body.</p>
<p>“That’s more like a Saint.” Holy God was very satisfied with the trio’s performance, especially Xiao and Jiuyang’s. It even surprised him.</p>
<p>The two of them grew unimaginably fast. Every Saint in the Holy Land was a genius, but in comparison, the other Saints appeared too mediocre.</p>
<p>Holy God had already begun thinking that he should raise the standard when searching for the wielders of the Holy Artifacts for the other three temples. He should search for people using Xiao and Jiuyang as the benchmark. A Saint like Godsfall definitely didn’t deserve being a Holy Son.</p>
<p>It’s about time he summons a Companion Beast, right? Holy God was also guessing when Zhou Wen would summon a Companion Beast. Zhou Wen had no intention of summoning a Companion Beast. He constantly brandished the Bamboo Blade as his body moved with the saber’s force. Although he was in a predicament, his actions remained composed.</p>
<p>To put it simply, even if his face was beaten until it swelled like a pig’s head, his hair never turned messy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1618'>Chapter 1618 Something’s Missing</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t do it to show off. He kept within his Transcendent Flying Immortal realm, which was why he produced such an effect. No matter how disadvantaged he was, his figure was still as graceful as an immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had been practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal during his battles with Starlord Ardent Virtue. Transcendent Flying Immortal had already reached an extremely high level of the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>In the battle with Jiuyang and company, he pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to the limits of the Heaven level.</p>
<p>However, no matter how extreme a Heaven-level martial technique was, it was ultimately at the Calamity grade. It was impossible for it to help Zhou Wen reverse the disadvantageous situation he was facing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never come into contact with the Apocalypse grade, nor did he know what kind of level it was. It was impossible to push Transcendent Flying Immortal to the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>However, during the battle, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that Transcendent Flying Immortal seemed to be missing something, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to figure out what he was lacking by exploiting the overwhelming disadvantage he was in while fighting Jiuyang and company. The Disqualified allowed Zhou Wen to deduce the opponent’s weakness. The Teacher Domain constantly replicated the opponent’s trajectory, allowing Zhou Wen to gain an understanding of their strength.</p>
<p>However, there was something that left Zhou Wen puzzled. After such an extended battle, there were already many trajectories left in the Teacher Domain with no further increase.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the three trajectories were still incomplete. They didn’t form a complete puzzle like the Void Salamander’s trajectory before turning into an Essence Energy Art. Could it be that the three of them relied on the Holy Artifact to reach the Heaven-level perfect domain? Therefore, in theory, their domains aren’t perfect, so they can’t form a perfect puzzle? Zhou Wen guessed. He had already tried many times. No matter how the Teacher Domain replicated their trajectories, it didn’t add new trajectories.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood for research. His mind was still focused on Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>What else is missing? After some thought, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what was missing</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal could be said to have reached the epitome of gracefulness. Be it its trajectory or concept, there were no flaws. Even the Teacher Domain couldn’t find any imperfections.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still felt that something was missing from such a perfect Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Could it be that it lacks the original domineeringness of Transcendent Flying Immortal? Zhou Wen thought of a possibility.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen had studied Transcendent Flying Immortal and had taken a domineering path which eventually led to him creating Immortal Slaying. Now that Transcendent Flying Immortal had changed to the path of an elegant immortal, it naturally didn’t have that domineering aura.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was wondering if the Immortal Dao’s Transcendent Flying Immortal lacked that domineering aura. If he fused domineeringness with the Immortal Dao, would it have a stronger effect? However, after some thought, Zhou Wen eliminated this possibility.</p>
<p>The Immortal Dao focused on elegance. Even the trajectory it took was an arc. As for dominance, it was straight forward. The fastest, strongest, most ruthless, and most domineering attack naturally had to go in a straight line.</p>
<p>Although they were both Transcendent Flying Immortals, in essence, the two had completely different modes. It was impossible for them to fuse together.</p>
<p>If it’s not lacking a domineering aura, what’s missing? Zhou Wen thought as he fought.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>Xiao’s palm streaked across his waist like a blade, slicing open the armor. Blood flowed out of the cracks in the armor.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had quite a number of such wounds, as well as the burn wounds left behind by Jiuyang’s Sun God Power.</p>
<p>The armor formed by the Limitless Demon Dragon King was only at the Terror grade after all. Its abilities far exceeded its level, but there was an obvious deficiency.</p>
<p>The defense of a Terror-grade armor was almost negligible under the attacks of a Calamity-grade expert.</p>
<p>Only an armor with Absolute Defense like the Prisoned Dragon armor could put up some resistance. The Dragon King armor wasn’t Prisoned Dragon armor, so it couldn’t reach that level. Therefore, he suffered serious injuries. If the Dragon King armor shattered, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to borrow the power of Truth Listener and the other Companion Beasts. When that happened, he would no longer be able to fight Jiuyang and company. It would be difficult for him to fight one-on-one, much less three.</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>As the ultra slow-motion analysis took a long time, the video played by the program team was greatly delayed. Even so, they skipped a lot of content in the middle and began to be analyzed from the back. If everything was played, it would probably happen days after the battle ended. Now, the analyzed content revealed Xiao and Jiuyang unleashing their power while Zhou Wen was in peril. He had already suffered quite a number of injuries. The armor was charred black and looked rather worrisome.</p>
<p>Professor Gu was delighted when he saw this.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s actions had really dealt a blow to him. He didn’t dare read the comments because they were all about him being a jinx.</p>
<p>When Professor Gu was young, he was once known as a genius, but that was in a small city in his hometown.</p>
<p>After entering a reputable school and seeing the elites from all over the Federation, he realized that his talent, which he had been proud of in the past, was worthless.</p>
<p>He had worked hard, hoping to change his life with hard work, but no matter how hard he tried, his elite peers were like mountains that he could only look up to.</p>
<p>This was because he knew that no matter how hard he worked, it was impossible for him to become the best in combat. Therefore, he switched to studying various theories.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t abandon cultivation, his combat strength and level were far inferior to his acumen.</p>
<p>With the results of his years of research, Professor Gu became a professor and participated in many programs. He was quite talented and some of his analysis was very accurate. He quickly accumulated fame. Over the years, he had always been ranked No. 1 in the industry. It could be said that he was an authority in this field. Professor Gu had always been proud of this, and he even became a little conceited. He couldn’t stand contrarian opinions. No matter what he did, he felt that he was right. Others just didn’t understand.</p>
<p>However, in the past few years, he had been very unhappy.</p>
<p>He had made frequent mistakes in the analysis of Human Sovereign, Deceit King, and company. Those were unprecedented. Recently, he had been labeled as Professor Jinx.</p>
<p>It was even more ridiculous today. He felt like his face was about to swell from Deceit King’s slapping.</p>
<p>Now that he saw Deceit King at a disadvantage, he immediately felt a breath of fresh air surge from his feet to his head, instantly energizing him.</p>
<p>Professor Gu knew that his chance had now come. He could finally avenge his humiliation.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll let you illiterates know what scientific analysis is. Jinx? There’s nothing of that sort. As a professor, my analysis is the most scientific and authoritative one. How can there be a mistake? Professor Gu was secretly delighted as he cleared his throat. “Ahem, it’s not surprising for such a situation to happen. I’ve analyzed it previously. Deceit King’s strength can at most compete with a Saint. In a three-on-one situation, he will definitely lose. Just like my previous analysis, it’s time for him to summon his Companion Beasts. I believe it won’t be long before we can see the Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General again.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1619'>Chapter 1619: Am I Really A Jinx?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Professor Gu’s analysis couldn’t be considered wrong, If Zhou Wen really had the Void Salamander and the crazy Tiger Soul General available, he would definitely have summoned them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t have it at all. He couldn’t summon it even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was calm, Although he was in grave peril, he didn’t panic at all. His mind was so calm that it made one’s hair stand on end. It was as though he didn’t know what terror and fear were.</p>
<p>The damage to the Dragon King armor increased, and Zhou Wen knew that he didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>What’s missing? Zhou Wen continued searching for an answer in battle.</p>
<p>Within the confines of Zhou Wen’s possible Strength and Speed, Transcendent Flying Immortal could be said to be a perfect technique. It fully utilized Zhou Wen’s Strength and Speed.</p>
<p>To be able to fight three alone—with all three Saints holding Holy Artifacts for so long without them finding any flaws—it was only because their strength was inferior that they were suppressed. This was enough to prove how powerful Transcendent Flying Immortal was.</p>
<p>That’s not right! Zhou Wen suddenly realized a problem.</p>
<p>It was true that Transcendent Flying Immortal was very powerful, but it wasn’t only because of Transcendent Flying Immortal that Zhou Wen had the upper hand despite fighting three alone.</p>
<p>The Disqualified allowed Zhou Wen to easily see through his opponent’s weaknesses and flaws. As for the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen quickly knew his opponent’s abilities like the back of his hand. Transcendent Flying Immortal looked so powerful because of the augmentation of these two abilities.</p>
<p>If I don’t have the ability of The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain, can Transcendent Flying Immortal still be so powerful? Zhou Wen immediately understood why he felt that Transcendent Flying Immortal was lacking something.</p>
<p>The strength of Transcendent Flying Immortal was built on external factors, not because it was really that powerful. The present Transcendent Flying Immortal was still lacking, but this loss was made up by external forces.</p>
<p>Making up for things was sometimes a good thing, but not all the time.</p>
<p>It was like an ancient monarch encountering a year of famine. There wasn’t even bran to eat, resulting in tragic events of people selling their children for food.</p>
<p>The citizens had no rice. It was already a life-and-death situation. After a minister reported it, the monarch actually answered, “Why don’t they eat meat?”</p>
<p>This monarch didn’t lack food and clothes, so he naturally couldn’t understand what hunger was. He could never put himself in a position to think of a solution, and it was very difficult for him to grow.</p>
<p>Now, Transcendent Flying Immortal was like a youth with a good family environment. Although he was outstanding enough, he was still a flower in a greenhouse. He had never experienced storms and had yet to become a true expert.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen resolutely gave up on using The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain. He forcefully separated the effects of the two powers from Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>It was very dangerous to do so. To do such a thing in such a disadvantageous situation was almost like playing with fire.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen chose to do so, he naturally had his confidence. Even if Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t truly grow, he wasn’t the monarch or a flower in a greenhouse. As a person who controlled Transcendent Flying Immortal, he was confident that it could truly mature before things went south.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was confident, he was thrown into a dangerous and problematic situation once Transcendent Flying Immortal lost the augmentation of the Teacher Domain and The Disqualified.</p>
<p>In that split second, Zhou Wen seemed to lose his original agility. Although his moves were still very elegant, they appeared somewhat lost as though he had lost his direction.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen failed to dodge Old K’s scepter and was struck in the abdomen. He was sent flying like a shrimp. The armor on his abdomen shattered, revealing his swollen abs.</p>
<p>Not long after his body flew out, Jiuyang appeared behind Zhou Wen. A sun-like fist struck Zhou Wen’s back.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, with the augmentation of The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen would have been able to predict and dodge the strike.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was somewhat slow to react. His movement technique was still bizarre, but he failed to dodge the punch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only turn around with all his might. He raised his scabbard and Bamboo Blade and crossed them in front of his chest to block the sun-like fist.</p>
<p>The flames exploded as the high temperature enveloped Zhou Wen’s body like a furnace. The Dragon King armor on his body had already turned into red-hot metal that was even dripping with molten liquid.</p>
<p>This was only because Zhou Wen had already used alll his Essence Energy to protect the Dragon King armor. Otherwise, the armor might have turned into liquid metal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fell into an extreme disadvantage. In a short period of time, the Dragon King armor suffered serious damage and was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Professor Gu had been looking forward to Deceit King summoning his Companion Beasts, hoping to wash away his reputation as a jinx.</p>
<p>However, from the ultra slow-motion video analysis, Deceit King didn’t seem to have any intention of summoning his Companion Beasts. Despite being at such a disadvantage, he still insisted on fighting the three saints with his skills.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Why aren’t you summoning your Companion Beasts at such a time? Do you really have a death wish? Professor Gu shouted inwardly, hoping to help Zhou Wen summon the Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General in his place.</p>
<p>Even if he only summoned one, that could wash away his reputation as a jinx.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing. Deceit King continued fighting alone.</p>
<p>‘When Zhou Wen forcefully dispelled the connection between The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain with Transcendent Flying Immortal, Professor Gu nearly jumped up.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? If you don’t summon your Companion Beasts, you’ll be dead. What’s the point of using tactics? That’s not how you hide your true strength. There should be a limit to playing the pig to eat the tiger. Otherwise, you’ll really end up a pig…” Professor Gu was somewhat agitated as he voiced</p>
<p>out his doubts.</p>
<p>Professor Gu’s words were nasty, but no one retorted. Everyone shared the same thoughts as Professor Gu. If he didn’t summon his Companion Beasts at this moment, it would be too late even if he eventually did.</p>
<p>If he were seriously injured and no longer had any combat strength, the three Saints could circle around his Companion Beasts and kill Deceit King first. When that happened, the powerful Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General would vanish together and be useless.</p>
<p>“Could Deceit King have gone overboard with his posturing and become a real pig?” Many people were worried. After all, the battle was right in front of them. Deceit King had already fallen into an absolute disadvantage. His injuries were getting worse and he was about to die.</p>
<p>The veins on Professor Gu’s forehead protruded as he roared inwardly. Summon a Companion Beast. Quickly summon a Companion Beast. Don’t tell me you’d rather die than summon a Companion Beast to f*ck me over, right?</p>
<p>Looking at the heavily injured Deceit King, Professor Gu suddenly felt a little afraid.. Could it be that I’m really a jinx? Because of my jinxed mouth, I made Deceit King Xiu crazy… He’d rather die than summon a Companion Beast?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1620'>Chapter 1620: Why Didn’t You Summon Companion Beasts?</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“What’s he doing?” Not only did Professor Gu not understand, but even Jiang Yan frowned as he watched the livestream.</p>
<p>He naturally knew that Zhou Wen didn’t have the Void Salamander, but at this moment, he hadn’t summoned any Companion Beasts. To fight the three saints without finding an opportunity to escape was clearly not Zhou Wen’s style.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me Old Zhou mistakenly thinks that he has an immortal body like me?” Li Xuan said with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p>Others might not know Zhou Wen, but he knew very well that if a fellow like Zhou Wen’s life was in danger, he would run faster than anyone. It was impossible for him to fight the enemy to the death.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen had done so, he definitely had some plans, so Li Xuan wasn’t worried at all.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu shared the same thoughts as Li Xuan. They had almost blind confidence in Zhou Wen, so they also believed that Zhou Wen was setting up a trap. The present disadvantage was only an illusion to entrap the enemy.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to think of a way to help him?” Xia Xuanyue looked at Li Xuan and company. She was somewhat puzzled. Are these fellows plastic brothers? They have long hoped for Zhou Wen’s death. Otherwise, why aren’t they showing the least bit of anxiety despite his prolonged battle? They have no</p>
<p>intention of thinking of a way to help.</p>
<p>Li Xuan even wore an excited expression as though he was delighted that Zhou Wen was being killed.</p>
<p>“Help him? Why help him? A fellow like Zhou Wen doesn’t need help,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue sized up Li Xuan, but she was judging what he meant. Do they really think highly of Zhou Wen and think that he can handle it himself, or do they wish for him to die?</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s situation wasn’t optimistic. It could be said that he was on the brink of death. This made Xia Xuanyue guess that the latter was more likely.</p>
<p>The city hasn’t even been built, but the internal conflict is already so serious? Xia Xuanyue thought.</p>
<p>“Coach is just practicing. He doesn’t need any help.” Feng Qiuyan’s words made Xia Xuanyue feel that the internal strife was dark and terrifying, At this point in time, was he still practicing? Would anyone practice at a time like this? He doesn’t even know how to lie, or rather, he can’t be bothered to hide it.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a well-taught disciple starves their masters. This disciple has yet to finish his apprenticeship, but he’s already looking forward to his teacher’s death. Xia Xuanyue sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Coach is just fooling around with them. When he’s tired with the games, it will only take a blink of an eye for him to turn the tables,” Ming Xiu added.</p>
<p>At this stage, he can still turn the tables in the blink of an eye. Can what you said be any more fake? Xia Xuanyue felt indignant for Zhou Wen as she looked at the only female among them, Qin Zhen.</p>
<p>She knew that Qin Zhen had always considered herself Zhou Wen’s disciple. Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu could only be considered half-disciples, but she was a true disciple. Perhaps she wasn’t as heartless as Li Xuan and company.</p>
<p>Seeing Xia Xuanyue look at her, Qin Zhen’s eyes were filled with admiration. She said excitedly, “Senior Zhou is teaching me the essence of Transcendent Flying Immortal through actual combat. In order to let me understand it, he deliberately doesn’t use all his strength to let me see it clearly. Senior is</p>
<p>really thoughtful, just like the notebook he gave me back then.”</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue looked at Qin Zhen with an odd expression. It was unknown if she was telling the truth or acting.</p>
<p>If she was acting, it looked sincere and heartfelt. It didn’t look fake at all.</p>
<p>However, those words were too fake if it weren’t an act. Only someone with a screw loose could say such words.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Wen is about to be killed, are you really stupid or faking it to think that he’s going out of the way to teach you? Xia Xuanyue began to doubt her judgment. She couldn’t help but watch the battle livestream carefully.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company said that Zhou Wen was deliberately hiding his strength, but no matter how Xia Xuanyue looked at it, she felt that Zhou Wen was about to be beheaded. He didn’t look like he was hiding his strength at all.</p>
<p>Are these four fellows really stupid, or do they want Zhou Wen to die so much? Xia Xuanyue couldn’t tell at all that Zhou Wen had any chance of survival.</p>
<p>“Summon a Companion Beast… Summon a Companion Beast… Summon a Companion Beast…” Professor Gu’s eyes were bloodshot as veins protruded from his forehead. He pressed his hands on the table and stood up, roaring at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>He didn’t wish to be a jinx, much less jinx Zhou Wen to death, but what the hell was going on today? Deceit King was about to be killed, but he still hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>This didn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense. Now, Professor Gu was a little afraid of himself. In the past, he didn’t take it to heart when people said that he was a jinx. But now, he couldn’t explain why Deceit King hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts. It was impossible.</p>
<p>“Unless…” Professor Gu’s voice was hoarse. As there were too many blood vessels, the whites of his eyes had tumed completely red. He looked ferocious and terrifying, but he was extremely uneasy.” Could it be… I’m really a jinx…”</p>
<p>Be it those who could understand the battle or those who couldn’t understand the battle through the slow-motion analysis, they were all puzzled. They couldn’t understand why this was happening.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu is really quite a jinx. Deceit King is about to fall.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu… Old Master Gu… I’m begging you… Stop talking about summoning Companion Beasts…”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t jinx it any more!”</p>
<p>“It’s over, it’s over. Even Deceit King can’t withstand Professor Gu’s jinx. He’s doomed.”</p>
<p>“Deceit King has lost all his intelligence from being jinxed. He’s on the brink of death. He definitely can’t summon Companion Beasts. Perhaps those Companion Beasts have already gone on strike and are rebelling.”</p>
<p>“Professor Jinx… He lives up to his reputation… What a pity for the great Deceit King…”</p>
<p>Some of the female fans who supported Deceit King were about to cry. They were all begging Professor Gu to stop jinxing it.</p>
<p>I’m not a jinx… I’m not… Professor Gu was on the brink of a mental breakdown. He was already in a daze as he jumped onto the platform. He pressed his hands on the big screen that was used for the broadcast, producing loud snapping sounds. The video on it flickered as he roared at the top of his lungs,</p>
<p>“Summon your Companion Beasts for me!”</p>
<p>“I’s over!” Those who had witnessed Professor Gu’s jinxes felt their hearts turn cold.</p>
<p>Professor Gu had given his all at jinxing, This mighty jinxed roar was something even Deceit King didn’t deserve at the cost of his life.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was once again struck by Old K’s scepter as his body flew to the side. And there, Jiuyang and Xiao were already ready to attack. The sun-like fist and the god-like fingers struck at Zhou Wen, who had lost his balance. Their attacks were inches away..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1621'>Chapter 1621: Zenith Heaven True Immortal</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>“I’s over!” Upon seeing this situation, Professor Gu’s excitement plummeted. He nearly collapsed on the commentary platform.</p>
<p>The audience felt disheartened. They felt that it wasn’t worth it for Deceit King to die just like that. He clearly had such powerful Companion Beasts, but he didn’t use them. It was truly unacceptable for him to die so tragically.</p>
<p>Sigh! Xia Xuanyue sighed inwardly. She had a good impression of Zhou Wen. She originally wanted to cooperate with him, but from the looks of it, there was no chance.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen was about to be hit by Jiuyang and Xiao, his body suddenly somersaulted.</p>
<p>It was as though he had just woken up from a dream and was stretching.</p>
<p>This seemingly languid action instantly dodged Jiuyang and Xiao’s attacks that were inches away. At the same time, it made Old K, who was pursuing him, lose his target.</p>
<p>“Something different seems to have happened!” Jiang Yan muttered to himself as he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“The real show is about to begin.” Zhong Ziya sat in the stone pavilion and leaned against the stone railing. He held a cigarette butt in one hand and a handful of fish food in the other as he casually threw them into the lake.</p>
<p>“Eh! That fellow’s aura seems to have changed into something strange.” Xia Liuchuan keenly sensed something.</p>
<p>“Tt seems like something fun is about to happen,” Zhang Chungiu said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>Old K and Jiuyang rushed forward to attack Zhou Wen again. Xiao’s body was like an illusion as his figure flickered in and out of existence. He constantly attacked from the distorted space, pointing at Zhou Wen’s vital spots from various unbelievable angles.</p>
<p>The present Zhou Wen seemed to have nothing mortal about him. Although Transcendent Flying Immortal was elegant, it was still somewhat domineering.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t cultivate it well, nor was it that being domineering was wrong. The most primitive skill of Transcendent Flying Immortal was 70% domineering. It was innate. It was just too difficult to change it after cultivating this much.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen changed it. He no longer had the domineering trait. Ignore the dominance, even the seven emotions and six desires of the mortal world seemed to have nothing to do with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s every move was like an otherworldly immortal. It was indescribably refreshing.</p>
<p>Jiuyang, Xiao, and Old K’s ferocious attacks were originally like a storm, but when they came in front of Zhou Wen, they seemed to turn into breeze or drizzle. For some reason, the ferocious attacks seemed to become soft and powerless as Zhou Wen easily resolved them.</p>
<p>“This is…” Upon seeing this scene, Holy God’s pupils suddenly constricted. He lost control of his emotions as his voice subconsciously rose.</p>
<p>However, Holy God wasn’t sure if what he saw was what he was thinking. Therefore, he widened his eyes and stared intently at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Everyone felt Jiuyang and company’s attacks suddenly turn soft in front of Zhou Wen for some reason. However, upon careful inspection, they realized that their attacks hadn’t weakened. They were still as powerful as before. The soft feeling was just an illusion.</p>
<p>And the one who created this illusion was naturally Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Professor Gu stared blankly at the slow-motion scene. Zhou Wen hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts, but he hadn’t been killed. Not only was he not killed, but he had even gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>That’s right, he had the upper hand. An advantage that was visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>No matter how ferocious the attacks of Jiuyang and company were, they gave off the strange feeling that Zhou Wen was playing with them instead of engaging in a life-and-death battle.</p>
<p>It felt like a professional world boxing king participating in a variety program or a celebrity in a martial arts movie choosing to fight the boxing king in the ring.</p>
<p>The boxing king naturally wouldn’t fight seriously. He would only play with them for the sake of the program. He would wear a look of forced seriousness and helplessness.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen gave off the feeling that experts as powerful as Jiuyang and Xiao were amateurs in front of him.</p>
<p>How did this happen!? Professor Gu slumped back in his chair and watched everything happen in a daze. He didn’t know what to feel.</p>
<p>“Why do I feel that… Deceit King seems very… very…” A person thought for a long time but couldn’t think of a word to describe Deceit King’s present state.</p>
<p>“Immortal!” someone beside him added.</p>
<p>“That’s right! It’s immortal. Why doesn’t Deceit King look like a thief? Why does he seem to be emitting an immortal aura…” The person from before slapped his thigh and shouted.</p>
<p>“It’s true. His every move feels ethereal, like an immortal untainted by the mortal world.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, to be able to fight so gracefully, Deceit King is a first!”</p>
<p>‘When Old K smashed his scepter over, Zhou Wen’s body moved as though he was blown by the wind. As he moved with the scepter, he gently raised the Bamboo Blade in his hand, causing the scepter to uncontrollably tilt to another angle.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s punch happened to strike at that spot, colliding with the scepter and producing a shocking explosion. The shockwave produced was like water ripples that quickly spread in all directions. Everything that came into contact with the shockwave was shattered and melted into magma. Old K rapidly</p>
<p>retreated and landed on the ground, creating a huge crater. His hand that held the scepter trembled non-stop. He couldn’t hold it any longer as blood kept dripping from his hand.</p>
<p>Xiao’s hand chopped at Zhou Wen’s neck from behind like a saber. As for his other hand, it swung out of the distorted space and stabbed at his abdomen like a hook.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t even turn his head as he moved the scabbard in his left hand out, slamming into Xiao’s hook-like left hand. At the same time, he used the force of the collision to quickly bounce up.</p>
<p>Due to Xiao’s strength, the scabbard bounced up extremely quickly. Zhou Wen twisted his scabbard-holding palm as though he was placing the scabbard on his shoulder.</p>
<p>However, the tip of the scabbard was aimed at Xiao’s throat. If Xiao continued charging at him and chopped at Zhou Wen’s neck with his right hand, Zhou Wen’s scabbard would definitely slam into his throat.</p>
<p>Despite fighting three alone, Zhou Wen was calm and composed. He was very casual as though everything had the panache of a god. His every move was incomparably elegant.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and company were played by his otherworldly saber techniques like panicked clowns.</p>
<p>If one hadn’t seen the previous battle, it would be difficult to believe that the three of them were peerless experts.</p>
<p>“Deceit King has really f*cking become an immortal!” someone shouted.</p>
<p>“How is this Deceit King… He’s clearly an Immortal King…”</p>
<p>Many people agreed. The title of Deceit King didn’t seem to match the true immortal-like figure in front of them.</p>
<p>This… This is the Apocalypse-level concept of the Immortals… Zenith Heaven True Immortal… He’s a human… He actually touched the highest concept of the Immortals… Although he has only just touched it… But… But… How is this possible… A mere human… A mere human… Holy God finally</p>
<p>confirmed his thoughts as his eyes were filled with shock.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1622'>Chapter 1622 Immortal Bandit</h3>
<p>Although Zhou Wen’s strength was inferior to Jiuyang’s and his speed was inferior to Xiao’s, he could defeat the three of them with the Transcendent Flying Immortal’s concept. The original encirclement looked like it had been cracked one by one.</p>
<p>The hard and straight Bamboo Blade and scabbard didn’t seem as solid in Zhou Wen’s hand. It gave off a very strange feeling as though the blade and scabbard had turned into soft ribbons.</p>
<p>Of course, the saber and scabbard didn’t change, nor could they bend. The feeling they gave off was purely a visual error brought about by the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Unlike the domineering and direct Immortal Slaying, Zhou Wen’s saber art was unpredictable. Not only was the trajectory of his saber art abnormal, but it could also divert external forces.</p>
<p>The blade met Jiuyang’s fist, but it didn’t collide with it. The blade spun and crossed Jiuyang’s fist as it slashed at his neck.</p>
<p>At the same time, the scabbard in Zhou Wen’s other hand slashed at Old K. Old K raised his scepter with both hands and faced the incoming scabbard.</p>
<p>The scabbard collided with the scepter, but it didn’t make a sound. At the instant the scabbard touched the scepter, Zhou Wen released the scabbard, his tiny fingers hooked to the end of the scabbard.</p>
<p>After the front of the scabbard made contact, it spun with the point of contact as the center. The part Zhou Wen held spun and struck Old K’s head.</p>
<p>Old K felt his head buzz as he sank. His body was slammed into the rock like a nail as the scabbard returned to Zhou Wen’s hand with the rebounding force.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did a backhand slash with the scabbard, blocking Xiao’s 13 ghostly attacks and forcing him to retreat.</p>
<p>Jiuyang retreated at high speeds as he struck out with his other hand at the Bamboo Blade. However, with a slight movement of Zhou Wen’s fingers, the Bamboo Blade was like an agile snake. The tip of the blade flicked back and stabbed into his wrist. It retracted immediately, having snapped his tendons.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, two of the three saints were injured.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how long it will take for me to catch up to Coach’s saber art.” Although Feng Qiuyan said that, he was calculating how much he had comprehended.</p>
<p>“Why isn’t Coach practicing sword techniques?” Ming Xiu wore a look of regret, but it wasn’t that he hadn’t gained anything. Saber techniques and sword techniques had something in common.</p>
<p>Qin Zhen remained silent as she silently memorized the Transcendent Flying Immortal that Zhou Wen had displayed. She had received Zhou Wen’s teachings and obtained the secret teachings of Transcendent Flying Immortal. However, even as a female sword immortal who had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal and became famous from it, she found it difficult to interpret it.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue was already dumbfounded. Many question marks appeared over her head. Was he really practicing his saber previously? Practicing his saber under the encirclement of the three Saints?</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, I’ve already said that there’s no need to worry. Old Zhou won’t die so easily.” Li Xuan still looked carefree.</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue really didn’t know what to say. She was still in shock. Such a saber technique probably couldn’t be called human anymore.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who really understood were shocked. Dugu Ge, Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and the younger Lance had goosebumps all over their bodies.</p>
<p>That fellow is really amazing. He can actually hone his saber techniques to such a level. I’ve been left far behind. No, I have to train now. I have to catch up to him as soon as possible. Lance’s eyes lit up. He stopped watching the livestream, turned around, and headed for the training grounds.</p>
<p>Soon, rumbling sounds came from the training grounds.</p>
<p>Seeing how the three Saints were suppressed by Zhou Wen to the point of barely being able to protect themselves, the seals on the two domains were meaningless. Holy God’s expression was as cold as eternal ice.</p>
<p>“Come back.” Although he wished he could skin Zhou Wen alive, Holy God still ordered a retreat.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if Jiuyang and company died, but if the three Holy Artifacts landed in Zhou Wen’s hands, it would undoubtedly be a huge blow to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, Jiuyang and company retreated without any hesitation.</p>
<p>As Xiao retreated, he strangely vanished.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Old K flew in two different directions. As the teleportation nexus was destroyed, they couldn’t return to the Holy Land directly.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had figured out an advanced concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal, it could only strengthen his combat strength. It couldn’t fundamentally increase his Strength and Speed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a problem to fight three alone, but it wasn’t that easy to catch up to them.</p>
<p>With a thought, Zhou Wen threw the Bamboo Blade in his hand at Old K. The Bamboo Blade transformed into a cold beam as it drew an arc in the air and quickly approached Old K’s back.</p>
<p>Old K had learned his lesson, so he didn’t dare use the scepter to block Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade. All he could do was dodge.</p>
<p>However, just as he dodged, he saw a golden light flash above his head. A golden pair of scissors landed on his neck. With a snip, his head immediately separated from his body. Blood splattered everywhere as the Guardian armor on his body shattered and dissipated.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived beside Old K’s corpse almost instantaneously and picked up the scepter.</p>
<p>The scepter was the same as the Connate Insight that Zhou Wen had previously obtained. It was a Holy Artifact of the six Holy Temples, but the Connate Insight came from the Connate Holy Temples, while the scepter came from the Divine Emperor Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Despite destroying the teleportation nexus and killing a Saint right in front of the Holy Land, nobody appeared. Such might was probably rare even in history. The Holy Land had never suffered such humiliation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there as the people watching the livestream looked at him as though he was an immortal.</p>
<p>The shouts of ‘Immortal King’ sounded everywhere in the Federation.</p>
<p>The Saints in the Holy Land were alarmed and furious. Holy God didn’t say a word, but his expression was extremely ugly.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, two Holy Artifacts had been snatched away by Zhou Wen. He had even camped at the Holy Land’s entrance to kill the Saints. It was insulting. If not for the suppression of Earth’s rules, Holy God would have personally taken action to kill Zhou Wen. Unfortunately, this was Earth, not the dimension. He could only fantasize.</p>
<p>Just as people were about to worship Zhou Wen like a god, they saw him bend down and reach out to search Old K’s corpse. He quickly placed the thing he had taken out of Old K’s body into his pocket.</p>
<p>This wretched action formed a stark contrast to his previous elegant figure. Everyone was stunned. They couldn’t imagine that it was the same person.</p>
<p>A second ago, Zhou Wen was still akin to an immortal, but now, he looked like an extremely greedy thief. He didn’t even spare the corpse.</p>
<p>“This…” The people who were shouting ‘Immortal King’ gradually softened their voices. They looked a little guilty and embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more appropriate to call him Immortal Bandit!” It was unknown who said this, but it immediately resonated with many people.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1623'>Chapter 1623 Harvest</h3>
<p>After Zhou Wen took out Old K’s items, he instant transmitted away. There was no reason to stay.</p>
<p>He definitely wouldn’t dare enter the Holy Land. Those Saints probably wouldn’t dare come out either. There was nothing to be done here. If anything really came out of the Holy Land, he might not be able to deal with it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t return to Guide City directly. Instead, he teleported to the planet where Tsukuyomi was. When he entered the glacier rift, he saw that Tsukuyomi was still there. She was enveloped by intense moonlight and had yet to complete her evolution.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nothing had happened. Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved as he took out all his spoils.</p>
<p>The baby Void Salamander Companion Egg was good stuff. Although it was only at the Human Realm, it could still evolve in the future. If it could grow to the level of the adult Void Salamander, it would be extremely powerful.</p>
<p>The key was that the power of void lightning was very destructive against spatial creatures. It might be of great use in the future. Zhou Wen had already decided to nurture the Void True Salamander.</p>
<p>Old K’s scepter was the same as the Connate Insight. Zhou Wen tried it, but there was no reaction. He probably needed a special physique and Essence Energy Art to use it.</p>
<p>There were also some things that he found on Old K. There were a few dimensional crystals, but their levels weren’t high. They were useless to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was a small box. It was made of metal and was locked. Zhou Wen didn’t manage to find the key. He used the Golden Wyrm Scissors to cut it open and realized that there was a sheepskin inside.</p>
<p>What’s this? Zhou Wen took out the sheepskin and realized that there were many red and blue lines on it. There were also some black spots. It looked like a map, but after studying it for a while, he couldn’t tell what map it was. All he could do was temporarily put it away.</p>
<p>Apart from these things, there was something else that had dropped after Zhou Wen killed the adult Void Salamander. He had stored it in the chaos space.</p>
<p>It was a crystal the size of a soccer ball. There seemed to be a mysterious void inside. Countless lightning bolts shimmered and flowed within. It looked irregular as it was born out of nothing before disappearing into the</p>
<p>void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense a very intense void lightning power in the crystal ball. He guessed that it was the Calamity essence of the Void Salamander.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have a void lightning attribute, but he couldn’t bear to use it as an energy supplement. Therefore, he put it away. When he hatched the Void Salamander, he might be able to use it to advance it a little.</p>
<p>That Void Lightning Grand Art only has spells. It’s a pure Essence Energy Art. I wonder if humans can cultivate it? Zhou Wen roughly looked at the content of the Void Lightning Grand Art and felt that it shouldn’t be a problem. However, he had already reached such a level, so there was no need for him to cultivate it.</p>
<p>In the future, if he met someone suitable, he might give it a try.</p>
<p>Without immediately incubating the Void Salamander, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate looked the same as before. She hadn’t grown taller, and her body didn’t seem to have changed much. She was wearing blackish-purple armor and hugging the Demonic Sword. The Heaven Shrouding Bell hung at her waist.</p>
<p>She stood there with a cold expression as though she was telling everyone not to approach.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and looked at her detailed stats.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate: Terror (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Child of Dimension</p>
<p>Life Soul: Supreme True Demon</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: One Spin.</p>
<p>Terror Form: Great Demon King (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Demon Domain (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 99</p>
<p>Speed: 99</p>
<p>Constitution: 99</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 99 Talent Skill: Demonic Sword, Heaven Shrouding Bell</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, she has a Calamity Zone at the Terror grade? It’s no wonder the power she provided me was so strong! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. A Terror-grade Calamity Zone was a little sick.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Demonic Neonate’s stats were very strange. When other Mythical creatures advanced to the Terror grade, they would probably break through to 82 points and absorb stat crystals to reach the 99-point limit of the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had reared many Companion Beasts, but once Demonic Neonate evolved, she was already at the 99-value limit. There was no need for her to absorb any more.</p>
<p>Neonate’s potential is really terrifying. I wonder what her origins are. Zhou Wen never expected Demonic Neonate to have such great potential.</p>
<p>It was surprising that the child, who looked like a barbarian, could grow to such a stage.</p>
<p>She should have come here from the time Teacher opened up the dimensional passageway. There’s a high chance that she’s a creature from the dimension. The chances of her being a devil are very high… Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he felt that it wasn’t that simple.</p>
<p>If it was only a high-level creature of the Devil race, even if it was the monarch of the Devil race, there was no need for Grim Demon to act like it was taboo. No matter how Zhou Wen threatened and tempted him, Grim Demon refused to reveal anything about Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>After all, anyone could guess from Demonic Neonate’s performance that she might be the monarch of the devils, so what was there to hide? Furthermore, Zhou Wen was Demonic Neonate’s master, so there was no need for Grim Demon to hide such matters.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look before his gaze landed on Demonic Neonate’s Life Providence and Wheel of Destiny. Demonic Neonate’s other abilities were related to devils, but her Life Providence was the Child of Dimension. This seemed problematic.</p>
<p>If she was the Devil Monarch, her Life Providence should have been Child of the Devil Monarch or even a Devil Monarch Life Providence. However, that didn’t happen. Zhou Wen didn’t understand what use the Life Providence-Child of Dimension-had.</p>
<p>There was also the problem of the Wheel of Destiny. Zhou Wen also had One Spin, but his One Spin was a postfix. In fact, the Wheel of Destiny was No Engravings. Perhaps the two were somewhat different.</p>
<p>However, even so, Zhou Wen still hadn’t discovered the use of this One Spin. Demonic Neonate naturally didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate without a word, likewise for Demonic Neonate. It was unknown what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed and reached out to stroke Demonic Neonate’s head.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate clearly had extremely high intelligence and was smarter than Zhou Wen’s other Companion Beasts, but for some reason, she didn’t communicate with anyone or play with other Companion Beasts. She wasn’t as lively as Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Zhou Wen wondered if she was a robot.</p>
<p>After getting Demonic Neonate to stand by the side, Zhou Wen took out the Void Salamander Companion Egg and injected Essence Energy to hatch it.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Void Salamander Companion Beast was no different from the baby Void Salamander. He had already seen its stats which remained unchanged.</p>
<p>He took out the Void Salamander’s crystal ball and made an attempt by placing it in front of the Void Salamander Companion Beast. It immediately swallowed the crystal ball without any hesitation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1624'>Chapter 1624 Starlord Martial Song</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>The moment the crystal ball was swallowed, the Void Salamander’s body began to emit void lightning. Its scales, four wings, and body appeared to begin transforming into lightning.</p>
<p>Moments later, the Void Salamander transformed into pure void lightning. Not long after, it automatically flew back to Zhou Wen and returned to its tattoo form.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take to evolve? Zhou Wen found it odd.</p>
<p>Typically, when a Terror-grade Companion Beast advanced to the Calamity grade, it would enter an evolutionary state. However, very few Companion Beasts would undergo such a situation at the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Typically, their domains would directly advance, so it didn’t take long.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have much experience advancing to a domain. He felt that it was possible that some Companion Beasts needed such a state.</p>
<p>After packing up, he glanced at Tsukuyomi beside him. The moonlight around her body didn’t show any signs of weakening.</p>
<p>I hope she can complete her evolution before Toad Immortal arrives. Zhou Wen took out his phone and continued gaming.</p>
<p>As he had already mastered his saber techniques, there was no need for him to use Starlord Ardent Virtue for practice.</p>
<p>After entering the Star Palace, he used the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor and eight Companion Beasts’ powers. Together with the Transcendent Flying Immortal he had just figured out, he quickly killed Starlord</p>
<p>Ardent Virtue. Unfortunately, only two stat crystals dropped.</p>
<p>Starlord Ardent Virtue sure is cool—if only a Companion Egg dropped. It would definitely be cool to produce him. Zhou Wen felt a little regretful.</p>
<p>Through the teleportation nexus, Zhou Wen headed for the next Star Palace. Now, Zhou Wen only wanted to clear all the Star Palaces so that the Starlords could quickly respawn and allow him to grind them</p>
<p>indefinitely.</p>
<p>These Starlords had their own characteristics. Even if it was just one, it was already considered an excellent-grade Companion Beast. Furthermore, typically speaking, such Companion Beasts might have a very high</p>
<p>compatibility score. Using the phone’s fusion function, he could probably fuse the seven Starlords into one. It would definitely be a Heaven-level Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The sixth star of the Big Dipper was called Mizar. Many people were unfamiliar with this name, but they were probably more familiar with the name ‘Martial Song’ in the East District.</p>
<p>The moment he entered the Mizar instance dungeon, Zhou Wen was stunned by the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>Is this the God of Fortune Hall or the Martial Song Star Palace?</p>
<p>There were four rows of trees planted in front of the Star Palace. A row of trees had copper leaves and copper branches, and they were covered in copper coins.</p>
<p>The second row of trees had silver leaves and silver branches filled with silver ingots.</p>
<p>The third row of trees was filled with golden leaves and silver branches.</p>
<p>The fourth row of trees was filled with colorful gems, pearls, agate, jade, and jadeite.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t known that this was the Mizar Star Palace where Starlord Martial Song resided, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was the territory of the God of Fortune.</p>
<p>In Zhou Wen’s impression, many humans in the ancient era claimed to be a mortal incarnation of Martial Song, but they were all famous generals. None of them were rich.</p>
<p>Could it be that everyone has made a mistake in the past? Not only can he fight, but he’s also especially rich? Zhou Wen thought of a superhero from a comic. That superhero’s superpower was ‘being rich.’ He was</p>
<p>especially good at fighting because he was rich.</p>
<p>With this curiosity in mind, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to push open the door to Mizar Star Palace.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is this some golden Saint Seiya? Zhou Wen looked at a huge money tree in the golden Star Palace.</p>
<p>Under the money tree sat a Starlord in golden armor with all sorts of gems embedded in him.</p>
<p>At a glance, he thought it was the godlike Saint Seiya, but on careful look, this money tree was a little too eye-catching. It wasn’t that sublime.</p>
<p>Starlord Martial Song was wearing golden armor with many gems on him. He was extremely dazzling. Zhou Wen still couldn’t understand his name.</p>
<p>As though he had discovered Zhou Wen’s arrival, Starlord Martial Song turned to look in his direction. Zhou Wen noticed that his eyes were still closed.</p>
<p>Bro, can you stop pretending to be a Virgoan, acting all reserved and self-effacing? Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>Although Starlord Martial Song didn’t open his eyes, he seemed to see Zhou Wen. He slowly raised his right hand and pointed his index finger at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg to protect his body. He had no intention of attacking first.</p>
<p>The main reason he was fighting the Starlords in-game was to understand their various abilities. It would be easier for him to challenge the dimensional zones in real life in the future. Killing him with one strike would</p>
<p>be straightforward, but in that case, he would still be clueless about Starlord Martial Song.</p>
<p>Starlord Martial Song pointed at Zhou Wen with his index finger. The finger covered under a golden gauntlet suddenly shimmered with a golden light that quickly surged into a golden halo.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the halo erupted as a golden beam shot out and headed straight for the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of blocking it, allowing the golden beam to hit the Chaos Egg. He wanted to know how powerful Starlord Martial Song’s offensive strength was and what special effects it had.</p>
<p>However, when the golden beam landed on the Chaos Egg, it didn’t produce any Essence Energy. Ignoring solid Essence Energy, there wasn’t even any liquid or gaseous Essence Energy.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen hurriedly sensed carefully and immediately realized that a golden coin had appeared where the golden beam had struck the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense anything amiss when the gold coin stuck to the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some kind of power seemed to rise from the gold coin. The power was intangible. Zhou Wen could only sense the existence of the power, but he couldn’t see it clearly.</p>
<p>Rustle! Rustle! Ding!</p>
<p>All sorts of strange sounds entered Zhou Wen’s ears. He immediately saw the gold, silver, copper coins, ingots, and gems on the hundred-meter-tall money tree with an umbrella-like crown shake violently as though</p>
<p>they were attracted by some force.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen had cleared five Star Palaces, but this was the first time he had seen such a situation employing external forces.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The copper coins on the tree flew over and shot at the Chaos Egg like raindrops.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that this would be a storm-like attack, but to his surprise, the copper coins stuck to the outside of the Chaos Egg. They covered the Chaos Egg tightly, turning it into a huge copper coin</p>
<p>ball.</p>
<p>As for the Chaos Egg, it didn’t produce any Essence Energy. This proved that the power of the copper coins didn’t attack the Chaos Egg and only enveloped it.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the silver ingots fell from the tree and flew towards the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Like the copper coins, the silver ingots stuck to the Chaos Egg and enveloped it.</p>
<p>Soon, the gold coins on the money tree fell and wrapped it in another layer..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1625'>Chapter 1625 Power of Money</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>Is he trying to kill me with money? Zhou Wen wore an odd expression. The copper, silver, and gold coins enveloped the Chaos Egg layer by layer, but they didn’t produce any destructive power.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, many gems, agate, and jadeite fell from the tree. The treasure glow that filled the sky flickered as though it was raining gems.</p>
<p>The falling gems once again enveloped the layer of gold coins and pieced together to form a bigger gem shell. There was no gap at all.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what use it had, he suddenly felt the copper coins, silver coins, gold coins, and gems that were wrapped outside instantly produce terrifying energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the next moment, a rainbow blast of light bloomed on the screen. It was so bright that one could go blind.</p>
<p>This only lasted for an instant. After the light flashed, the screen turned black. The blood-colored avatar under the Chaos Egg’s protection was killed.</p>
<p>So after all of that, those coins and gems were time bombs! Zhou Wen immediately came to a realization. He had watched helplessly as his opponent planted countless bombs on him before blowing him up.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were in reality, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t have given Starlord Martial Song such a chance. This was only an experiment. It was why Starlord Martial Song had the time to plant the money bombs on</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>However, the might of the money bombs left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised. The Chaos Egg’s defense was strong, but it was instantly destroyed. Even a Heaven-level expert might not be able to withstand such</p>
<p>destructive power.</p>
<p>He entered the game again and arrived at the Mizar Star Palace, only to have Starlord Martial Song shoot the golden beam again. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t choose to passively take a beating. He unsheathed his</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade and slashed at the golden beam.</p>
<p>The golden beam struck the blade and immediately shattered. However, a golden coin-shaped mark appeared on the blade.</p>
<p>After the gold coin mark appeared, the coins on the tree fell again. Zhou Wen brandished his saber to slash at the coins. Wherever the saber beam passed, the copper coins exploded. The power of a single copper coin</p>
<p>bomb was equivalent to a strike at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>As for the destructive power produced by the explosion of the silver coins, it was much stronger than the copper coins. The gold coins and gems also became stronger. Zhou Wen estimated that the destructive power</p>
<p>produced by the explosion of the gems was very close to the Heaven level. It was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder the Chaos Egg was blasted apart just now. With so many coins and gems wrapped around it, it would be strange if it wasn’t destroyed. Zhou Wen experimented again and again, becoming more and more</p>
<p>familiar with the abilities of the money tree and Starlord Martial Song.</p>
<p>Starlord Martial Song was indeed very good at fighting. He was extremely fast, and every strike carried the power of money. Wherever he struck, the money mark would appear. Then, the coins and gems on the money</p>
<p>tree would automatically fly towards the mark.</p>
<p>As long as he was hit by a money mark, he would be bombarded by copious amounts of money until he was blasted to death alongside the disappearance of the money mark.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized that even a Heaven-level expert couldn’t withstand the attack of the money tree. The only way was to kill Martial Song before that.</p>
<p>This wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. Once he put on the Demon Dragon King armor and he had the power of his eight pets, he could kill Starlord Martial Song with Transcendent Flying Immortal without touching him.</p>
<p>However, there was something that puzzled Zhou Wen. Starlord Martial Song’s money powers were only at the Hell level. They hadn’t reached the Heaven level, but the Teacher Domain couldn’t completely seal them.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen beheaded Starlord Martial Song with Transcendent Flying Immortal. As his corpse dissipated, a dimensional crystal dropped. At the same time, a Samsara Stone appeared.</p>
<p>Another Samsara Stone! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he realized that the dimensional crystal wasn’t an ordinary stat crystal, but a skill crystal.</p>
<p>Apart from that, a few gems on Starlord Martial Song’s armor fell. The gems emitted intense Calamity-grade Essence Energy fluctuations. They were clearly the source of the Calamity transformation.</p>
<p>What a pity. I can’t take this Calamity-grade Essence away. Zhou Wen found it regretful.</p>
<p>Calamity creatures expended a large amount of Essence Energy, but Companion Beasts were an exception. As long as they weren’t summoned, even Heaven-level creatures didn’t expend much Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Even if he summoned them out, Zhou Wen had the ability to produce Essence Energy through the Chaos Egg. As long as he suffered enough attacks, he could condense high-level compressed solid Essence Energy</p>
<p>Crystals that could be used for his Calamity-grade Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Which Calamity-grade Companion Beast is most compatible with Starlord Martial Song’s strength? Perhaps I can use the power of these gems to advance my Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen thought of his few</p>
<p>Calamity-grade Companion Beasts and nothing came to mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and attempted to give the gem to Demonic Neonate, but Demonic Neonate wasn’t interested at all.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen fed the gem to Golden Wyrm Scissors, but it only slightly improved its Essence Energy. It didn’t advance any further.</p>
<p>Starlord Martial Song Crystal: Money-type Terror transformation, Strength 99, Constitution 99, Speed 99, Essence Energy 99.</p>
<p>The requirement for this thing wasn’t high. Zhou Wen had already met the stats requirement, but he really couldn’t meet the requirement for money-type Terror form. All he could do was abandon it.</p>
<p>The Samsara Stone was good stuff. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and gave it to Primordial Spore.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore’s parasitizing ability was very strong, but because it was only at the Mythical stage, it was very difficult for it to parasitize high-level creatures. It had to raise its level to have a chance of parasitizing</p>
<p>higher-level creatures.</p>
<p>After all, at the Calamity grade, the tiny body of Primordial Spore no longer had the advantage. It was very easy for Calamity-grade creatures to see it, so it was almost impossible to secretly carry out parasitisation.</p>
<p>Primordial Spore: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Eternal Immortality</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Parasitizing</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>As Primordial Spore couldn’t evolve to begin with, Zhou Wen didn’t know how to evolve it. After experimenting a few times, he realized that the fellow couldn’t absorb Essence Energy Crystals. It had to parasitize a</p>
<p>creature and suck away its essence, vitality, and spirit before evolving.</p>
<p>However, Primordial Spore was too weak in the beginning. It could only parasitize low-level creatures, so its growth was very slow. It could only be nurtured slowly with no better way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could go to the Moon to obtain some osmanthus flowers, but he didn’t plan on doing so. Such an evolution was very fast, but he might not be able to nurture a truly good pet.</p>
<p>Although it was a little troublesome, Zhou Wen still chose to let Primordial Spore parasitize different dimensional creatures..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1626'>Chapter 1626 Shaking the Star Palace Empty</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>n the fleeting clouds, jade buildings appeared and disappeared like mirages.</p>
<p>A jade pavilion would appear in the clouds one second, turning into a palace the next second.</p>
<p>From time to time, one could see mountain peaks floating in the air. The mountain peaks had something divine about them. Some of the mountain peaks were unique and dangerous, while others carried a weight of</p>
<p>solemnity. There were even mountain peaks that seemed to support the heavens as they stood erect in the world.</p>
<p>However, they seemed to be illusions. The flight of a beautiful butterfly across them or the drifting of clouds would result in the images of the jade buildings and mountains vanishing.</p>
<p>n the sea of clouds that filled the sky, there was a small boat slowly advancing. At the bow stood a man. His white clothes fluttered slightly with the clouds, but his long hair that resembled ice and snow hung behind</p>
<p>him without any ripples.</p>
<p>He was handsome with a pair of crystal-like dragon horns on his head. Although he was handsome, he didn’t have the sharp angular features of a typical handsome man. His face was softer, giving off a gentle feeling.</p>
<p>When the boat arrived in front of the mirage-like clouds, a jade building gradually appeared as butterflies flew out.</p>
<p>The butterflies that looked like phantoms gradually turned corporeal. Their wings flapped, sweeping away the clouds like a veil, making the illusory jade building behind the clouds appear even more real.</p>
<p>The boat beneath the white-robed man’s feet had already stopped as he calmly looked at the jade building. On the jade building’s plaque were two words that didn’t seem to be tainted by the mortal world.</p>
<p>Immortal Crossing. The white-robed man silently read the words on the jade building’s signboard. His eyes revealed a strange look that seemed to be praise, but also somewhat different.</p>
<p>“Immortality and mortality are just separated by a single thought. The world only knows how to seek an immortal destiny, but they don’t know that such destiny is already across them. It’s just that the world is ignorant</p>
<p>and doesn’t know how to redeem themselves.” A woman’s voice sounded from the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.</p>
<p>“Having been summoned, Dragon King of the Octokind, Wang Mingyuan, is humbly here before you to pay my respects. May I know which Immortal Supremacy of the Immortals you are?” Wang Mingyuan folded his</p>
<p>arms in front of his chest, his sleeves hanging down as he bowed slightly.</p>
<p>The woman in the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion didn’t seem to hear him as she continued, “Zhou Wen is your disciple?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Wang Mingyuan answered calmly.</p>
<p>“Where did he obtain the concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal?” the woman asked again.</p>
<p>“Self-taught.” Wang Mingyuan remained as gentle as ever.</p>
<p>t’s rare for an Immortal to comprehend the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal. Do you think a mere mortal human can comprehend the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal?” The woman’s voice</p>
<p>was somewhat cold.</p>
<p>‘ve never taught him. If he hadn’t figured it out himself, I wouldn’t know how he learned it either,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>if you can teach the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal, us Immortals will respect you as master.” The woman’s voice turned even colder.</p>
<p>wouldn’t dare.” Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly. His eyes were lowered, but he didn’t bend his back.</p>
<p>“Go. Bring Zhou Wen to the Immortals.” The woman’s voice sounded again.</p>
<p>mmortal Supremacy, may I ask why you want him to come to the Immortals?” Wang Mingyuan had no intention of leaving.</p>
<p>f I say I want to kill him, will you bring him here?” The woman seemed to be born a cold person. Her voice had a coldness that kept others at bay.</p>
<p>“No, but I know that you won’t kill him, Immortal Supremacy. There’s no need to go through so much trouble to kill him if you want him dead,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“You know that I won’t kill him, but you still reject me. Do you think that I won’t really kill you because of my good temper?” With the woman’s voice, infinite power seemed to surge out of the Immortal Crossing Jade</p>
<p>Pavilion like invisible threads that bound Wang Mingyuan’s body.</p>
<p>Tears immediately appeared on Wang Mingyuan’s clothes due to the invisible threads. The silk clung tightly to his skin, and an invisible thread had already wrapped around his neck. Just touching his skin was enough</p>
<p>to slice through the crystalline jade-like skin as blood seeped out.</p>
<p>It was as though Wang Mingyuan’s head would leave his body forever with just a thought from the woman.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of offending you. I just want you to know that I’m his master and naturally have to suffer any punishment my disciple needs to suffer.” Wang Mingyuan’s expression remained calm as before. The</p>
<p>gentleness seemed to have penetrated deep into his bones. Even if his head was chopped off, it would be difficult for him to turn ferocious.</p>
<p>The invisible threads suddenly retracted before dissipating, as though the mirage in the clouds had never existed.</p>
<p>“The path to immortality and mortality is gradually opening. There’s nothing stopping it in this great world. All races vie for supremacy, and my race needs a Holy Son in the human world. Go, bring Zhou Wen to the</p>
<p>Immortals. As long as he’s my race’s Holy Son, the matter between Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal will be written off.”</p>
<p>The Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion gradually vanished into the clouds, going from something corporeal to nothingness. Finally, it vanished like a phantom. Only the woman’s voice echoed in the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>“Wang Mingyuan bids… farewell…” Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly and turned around on the boat. He looked at the ethereal sea of clouds with a smile in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued exploring the Star Palace and entered the seventh Star Palace.</p>
<p>The seventh star of the Big Dipper was Alkaid, and the Starlord was Army Breaker. It was said that he was a Starlord with immense killing intent. Legend had it that he was an extremely destructive existence just like</p>
<p>the Seven Killings Star.</p>
<p>However, after seeing Starlord Martial Song, Zhou Wen was still very doubtful whether Starlord Army Breaker was the kind with immense killing intent.</p>
<p>After teleporting into the Alkaid dimensional zone, he immediately saw the Star Palace. It looked surprisingly normal. A proper Star Palace stood in the sun-like halo.</p>
<p>There was a long staircase from where Zhou Wen stood to the front of the Starlight Palace. It looked like a staircase to heaven.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stepped onto the stairs and walked towards Alkaid Star Palace, but he quickly realized that his Essence Energy was rapidly drained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sped up and charged towards the Star Palace’s door, but the faster he charged, the faster he lost his Essence Energy. Before he reached the midway point, nearly half his Essence Energy had been drained.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he used spatial teleportation to reach the end of the steps and the door to Alkaid Star Palace.</p>
<p>However, at the instant he instant transmitted out, he felt the Essence Energy in his body empty. There wasn’t even a drop left. His legs went limp and he nearly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Thankfully, even without Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s physique was already rather powerful. He stood firm and looked at the door of Alkaid Star Palace. He was somewhat surprised. As expected of the last star of the</p>
<p>Big Dipper. My Essence Energy is useless before entering the Star Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already attempting to recover his Essence Energy. His Essence Energy recovery speed was very fast, but here, as long as there was a sliver of Essence Energy in his body, it would immediately be</p>
<p>drained. There was no way to gather it..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1627'>Chapter 1627 Strange Sound</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon</h5>
<p>After activating the Teacher Domain, the Essence Energy in his body immediately stopped draining. The restored Essence Energy wouldn’t be drained again, and it didn’t</p>
<p>take long for it to return to normal.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s only a taboo power. Zhou Wen pushed open the door to Alkaid Star Palace and saw resplendent starlight inside.</p>
<p>The interior of Alkaid Star Palace was hemispherical. The spherical dome had resplendent starlight, like a miniature starry sky.</p>
<p>In the miniature starry sky floated a Starlord in blue armor. Everything seemed to revolve around him.</p>
<p>Is that Starlord Army Breaker? Zhou Wen stared at the Starlord floating in the air and summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors to attack him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just waiting to see how strong the last Starlord of the Big Dipper, Starlord Army Breaker, was. To his surprise, when the Golden Wyrm Scissors charged over,</p>
<p>Starlord Army Breaker failed to put up a timely defence and was sliced into two.</p>
<p>‘Killed Calamity creature, Starlord Army Breaker. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>This… And it’s over… Zhou Wen was taken aback before he realized that Starlord Army Breaker had really died.</p>
<p>Even when Zhou Wen picked up the dimensional crystal on the ground, he still found it unbelievable that the last dungeon of the Big Dipper instance dungeon had ended</p>
<p>just like that.</p>
<p>Could it be that this isn’t the last Star Palace in the Big Dipper instance dungeon? There’s another Star Palace behind it? Zhou Wen walked to the teleportation nexus,</p>
<p>hoping to see if he could teleport to the next Star Palace.</p>
<p>However, he only had the choice of leaving the Star Palace. There was no subsequent Star Palace for teleportation.</p>
<p>Although he found it unacceptable, it was the truth. Zhou Wen had no choice but to teleport out of the dungeon.</p>
<p>There were a total of seven Star Palaces in the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Zhou Wen had already cleared them, but the seven Starlords inside hadn’t respawned. Zhou</p>
<p>Wen wanted to wait 24 hours to see if the seven Starlords inside would respawn.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take for Tsukuyomi to completely absorb the Moon Essence Basin. Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi beside him. The moonlight didn’t show any</p>
<p>signs of weakening.</p>
<p>He stood up and stretched. He originally wanted to release Liz and Leem to let them take a breather and chat with him, but on second thought, he dispelled this thought.</p>
<p>This wasn’t Earth. In such an environment, one couldn’t survive without strength at the Mythical stage or above.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to summon Banana Fairy and other highly-intelligent Companion Beasts, he suddenly heard a strange sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. Could it be another cosmic creature?</p>
<p>However, after Zhou Wen listened carefully, he realized that the sound didn’t come from the sky, but from beneath the nearby glacier.</p>
<p>Badump! Badump!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the sound resembling a heart beat. It was very rhythmic. It wasn’t loud, but he could hear it clearly.</p>
<p>The sound came from the depths of a glacier rift. The rift was deep and exceeded Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>He summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors, the Soul Mirror, and a few other Calamity-grade Companion Beasts and got them to guard Tsukuyomi. Zhou Wen took Demonic</p>
<p>Neonate and instant transmitted towards the glacier rift.</p>
<p>When he arrived beside the rift, the sounds became even more obvious. They came from below. They were deep and powerful, like the salvos of heavy cannons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully observed the glacier rift and realized that it was like a huge flat trumpet. The further down he went, the smaller the space became. Furthermore, it was</p>
<p>very deep. He still didn’t discover the source of the sound despite going to the limits of Truth Listener’s hearing range. It was probably further down.</p>
<p>The structure of the entire glacier rift was like a flattened trumpet. As for what was below, Zhou Wen didn’t know.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Zhou Wen turned around and returned.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was still absorbing the power of the Moon Essence Basin and couldn’t move. If there was really something terrifying down there and Zhou Wen lured it out, it</p>
<p>would be very disadvantageous for Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to restrain his curiosity. It wouldn’t be too late to explore it after Tsukuyomi returned to normal.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried if the thing that emitted the sounds from the glacier rift would come out by itself.</p>
<p>The beating sounds didn’t stop. After Zhou Wen returned to the ice cavern, he kept paying attention to the situation. Although nothing rushed out of the glacier rift, the</p>
<p>sounds made Zhou Wen feel extremely weird.</p>
<p>I hope everything will be fine before Tsukuyomi returns to normal. Zhou Wen was puzzled. Logically speaking, it’s impossible for Tsukuyomi to deliberately choose a</p>
<p>dangerous place for her residence.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Although there was nothing abnormal from the glacier rift, Zhou Wen didn’t let down his guard.</p>
<p>After some time, Zhou Wen suddenly heard something amiss.</p>
<p>Previously, the sound from the other side was very rhythmic, just like a heartbeat. But now, the sound was different in frequency and rhythm.</p>
<p>Eh! Zhou Wen listened for a while longer and realized that the rhythm of the sound seemed to be the rhythm of some tune, not just a random beat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this tune seemed to be very pumped and cheerful. There were continuous thumping sounds that sounded like drums.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned inwardly as he continued paying attention to the glacier rift. He was already prepared to react.</p>
<p>However, nothing appeared. The rhythm of the sound kept changing like a drummer’s drumbeat.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen found it odd and was somewhat curious about what was down there, he didn’t dare take the risk to investigate.</p>
<p>After some time, a high and sharp voice suddenly sounded, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Previously, it had been a low, thumping sound, but now, it resounded through the clouds like a trumpet. Even if he didn’t use Truth Listener, he could probably hear it</p>
<p>clearly in every corner of the planet. Zhou Wen’s eardrums were about to be pierced by the sound.</p>
<p>After this shrill sound, it returned to its previous low, thumping sound. There was no other sharp sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen listened attentively, but after the earth-shattering sound, there was no abnormal activity.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen relax a little. He walked out of the ice cavern and planned on moving about.</p>
<p>However, when he walked out of the ice cavern and raised his head to stretch his neck, he suddenly realized that a cosmic creature had appeared outside the planet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was more than one. There were already several different types of cosmic creatures cruising outside the planet’s atmosphere. They were all strange in</p>
<p>shape, like monsters circling the dining table..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1628'>Chapter 1628 Something Big Is Going to Happen</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly hid in the ice cavern, afraid that the cosmic creatures would discover his whereabouts.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen secretly sized up the dimensional creatures, he thought to himself, Why are there so many cosmic creatures here? Are they here for Tsukuyomi? Or is it related to the sound under the glacier?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already discovered five cosmic creatures. One of them was enveloped by a huge electromagnetic storm. He couldn’t tell what it looked like. Occasionally, he would see strange snake-like tentacles extend out from the electromagnetic storm before quickly retracting</p>
<p>From a mere fleeting glance, he could tell that the tentacle was probably thousands of meters</p>
<p>long.</p>
<p>There was also a colorful strange fish with a transparent, muslin-like tail. It swam around the planet as though space had turned into a fish pond.</p>
<p>In addition, there were two wolf-like creatures with black and white unihorns. They stood in the asteroid belt near the planet and stared into the interior of the planet. The white Unicorn Wolf’s eyes were black, while the black Unicorn Wolf’s eyes were white. Their eyes emitted a demonic glow.</p>
<p>There was also a dream-like blue ribbon of light that circled the planet and flew at high speeds outside the atmosphere. It looked like a transparent blue ribbon of light. It was unknown if it looked like this to begin with or if it had some special ability.</p>
<p>Although he only roughly observed them and was too far away to scan them in detail, he could tell that they were likely Calamity-grade creatures.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, they’re not here for Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen thought to himself. If they were here for Tsukuyomi, they would have rushed in like the Void Salamander and eaten her while she couldn’t move.</p>
<p>However, the cosmic creatures were only loitering around the periphery of the planet. None of them entered the atmosphere as though they were afraid of something. Were they attracted by the sound under the glacier rift? What’s there? Could it be that the Companion Beast in this planet is about to appear? If a planet’s Companion Beast is about to appear, a corresponding dimensional zone should appear… Zhou Wen sized up the glacier rift again.</p>
<p>If a planet’s Companion Beast really appeared, that place was probably the entrance to the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what the cosmic creatures were afraid of. Why hadn’t they entered the atmosphere? Even if a planet’s Companion Beast had really appeared, there was no danger as long as they didn’t enter the dimensional zone. It didn’t seem like there was no reason for them to land.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi, you have to be faster! Zhou Wen turned to look at Tsukuyomi and couldn’t help but feel depressed when he saw that she remained motionless. The moonlight on her body didn’t weaken at all.</p>
<p>Something big was definitely happening. Even if they weren’t here for Tsukuyomi, how could they miss a delicacy when they discovered a immobile Calamity creature like Tsukuyomi?</p>
<p>Calamity creatures basically ate Calamity creatures to replenish their energy.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the cosmic creatures didn’t rush into the planet for the time being. There was still some buffer time, but this was what Zhou Wen was worried about.</p>
<p>Something that could make so many cosmic creatures afraid was probably not a good thing. Now that they were above this planet, the situation might end up being worse than having the cosmic creatures rush over.</p>
<p>The sound from the glacier rift was still sounding. Amidst the low thumping sounds, there would occasionally be a sharp trumpet-like sound.</p>
<p>Every time the sharp sound sounded, some cosmic creatures would appear outside the planet. The first five cosmic creatures that appeared each occupied a certain area. Many cosmic creatures that appeared later were devoured or killed by the five cosmic creatures the moment they approached their territory. Most of the cosmic creatures that appeared later were at the Terror grade. They were very afraid of the first five cosmic creatures that appeared, but they couldn’t bear to leave. They watched from afar.</p>
<p>Something big is about to happen! Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss as he looked at the strange cosmic creatures on the periphery of the planet. This matter was bizarre.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already considering if there was any way to safely evacuate Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Beep! Beep!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was thinking of a solution, he heard a faint sound coming from the ice cavern.</p>
<p>The ice cavern was also under the glacier rift, but it wasn’t in the same area as the glacier rift that produced the sound. It was thousands of kilometers away. At that moment, there was a sound coming from beneath the glacier fault beside the ice cavern. It immediately gave Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately raised Truth Listener’s ability to its limits and swept it towards the bottom of the glacier fault.</p>
<p>The fault layer of the glacier wasn’t deep. It only extended about four thousand meters down from the ice cavern. Zhou Wen had previously scanned it with Truth Listenerthere was a thick glacier at the bottom without anything else.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a beeping sound coming from below. It left Zhou Wen alarmed as he scanned the area again. He realized that a pool the size of a well had melted at the bottom of the fault.</p>
<p>Tiny bubbles slowly rose from the water before slowly bursting. Zhou Wen stared at the tiny bubbles and used Truth Listener’s ability to venture deep into the pool.</p>
<p>The appearance of tiny bubbles made it very likely that there were creatures below. Zhou Wen had to figure out what was down there. It was too close to the ice cavern, so once the thing inside came out, they would definitely be the first to bear the brunt of the impact.</p>
<p>This pool was also strange. The bottom was the same as the top, with a pool that had melted the size of a well’s hole. Beyond it was hard ice that showed no signs of melting.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the pool wasn’t as deep as Zhou Wen imagined. After a few hundred meters, Zhou Wen finally saw the bottom of the pool. It was still a glacier, but there was a strange plant growing there.</p>
<p>The plant was very strange. The leaves were like circular mushroom caps. Each leaf was the size of a palm and the blue color had some translucency. Layers of leaves rose up layer by layer. And at the top, there was a fruit that looked like a peach. It was the size of a fist and would produce tiny bubbles from time to time.</p>
<p>The tiny bubbles that rose to the surface came from this peach-like fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a powerful vitality from the strange underwater plant, but it was only vitality. It wasn’t accompanied by any intense Essence Energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>What’s this? A native plant on this planet? Zhou Wen was puzzled. After scanning for a while, he didn’t discover anything special about the plant.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sharp trumpet-like sound came from the distant glacier rift.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1629'>Chapter 1629 Strange Tiny Bubbles</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was already used to the sharp sound and didn’t find it strange. However, when he heard this new sound, his eyes suddenly widened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seemed to find it unbelievable as he widened his eyes even more as though he wanted to see something clearly.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need for him to do so. This was because he couldn’t see what he wanted to see with his eyes. He needed Truth Listener to hear it to produce a scene in his mind.</p>
<p>It was an unconscious natural reaction because of his surprise.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen wanted to see was the tiny bubbles produced by the plants in the water.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen didn’t pay too much attention to the tiny bubbles. He only paid attention to the plant itself.</p>
<p>However, when the sharp sound sounded, Zhou Wen discovered something strange.</p>
<p>Before the sharp sound, a bubble that was somewhat different from ordinary bubbles rose from the peach-like fruit. Although the size of the bubble was no different from an ordinary bubble, its color was a little wrong. It was a faint blue color. The color wasn’t deep, but it was still distinguishable from ordinary bubbles.</p>
<p>The moment the bubble appeared was the instant before the sharp sound. It was too much of a coincidence.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay much attention in the beginning, but because of this, he subconsciously began paying attention to the ordinary bubbles. Then, he was surprised to make a discovery.</p>
<p>Every time an ordinary bubble appeared, he would hear a low thud.</p>
<p>The bubbles surfacing from the fruit matched the sound produced by the glacier crack 100%. Furthermore, bubbles would appear first before the sound came from beneath the glacier crack.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Could it be that the sound below is affected by this plant? Zhou Wen scanned the plant again and again in surprise, but he didn’t discover any definite relationship between the plant and the glacier rift.</p>
<p>It was rooted in the ice, and the roots below could be seen clearly. It was all in the glacier, with no other place connected to the outside world.</p>
<p>There were no gaps under the ice. It seemed unlikely that such a tiny plant could connect to the glacier rift thousands of kilometers away and cause a huge sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed for a long time. When the glacier rift produced a sharp sound again, a unique blue bubble appeared from the fruit.</p>
<p>There’s no mistake about it. The glacier rift definitely has something to do with this plant, but what is it? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>More and more cosmic creatures were attracted by the sound. In the Holy Land, Holy God was also observing the glacier-covered planet through a Spirit Light Mirror.</p>
<p>“Lord Holy God.” Xiao and Jiuyang walked in and bowed to Holy God.</p>
<p>“Come and take a look,” said Holy God as he looked at the Spirit Light Mirror.</p>
<p>“Is this planet’s Companion Beast about to appear?” Jiuyang said after taking a look. “It’s true that the planet’s Companion Beast is about to appear.” Holy God paused before continuing, “However, this planet is somewhat different. It probably won’t be that easy for its Companion Beast to appear.”</p>
<p>“What happened on this planet?” Xiao asked. Holy God pondered for a moment and said, “This planet’s Companion Beast is actually not its original Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Not it’s original Companion Beast? Can the Companion Beasts produced by a planet be replaced?” Jiuyang was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Holy God said indifferently, “There’s a type of bee on Earth that will lay its eggs in other larvae. The eggs will absorb the nutrients of the larva and grow until they tear out of its body.”</p>
<p>“That’s too cruel.” Jiuyang sighed.</p>
<p>“Cruel? Perhaps you should know that there’s another bird on Earth called a cuckoo. It will secretly place its egg in the nests of other birds and get other birds to help hatch it. And after the cuckoo breaks out of its shell, it will push the other eggs out and smash them to pieces. It will enjoy all the food alone,” Holy God added.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s scalp went numb. In contrast, cuckoos were even more sinister. They killed the other party’s children and got the other party to raise it.</p>
<p>“In other words, the Companion Beast on that planet has been parasitized. Who has the ability to parasitize a planet?” Xiao asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Another Companion Beast, a Companion Beast that had no choice but to parasitize because its planet was accidentally destroyed.” Holy God paused before saying, “In the Mythical era, in the battle of the gods, a planet was accidentally shattered. Back then, many experts present wanted to snatch the Companion Beast that had appeared ahead of time, but no one succeeded. It escaped into this planet.”</p>
<p>“Those experts can shatter a planet. Can’t they shatter this planet too?” Jiuyang asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve already said that it was an accident. How can a planet protected by the rules of the universe be so easily cracked?” Holy God pondered for a moment and continued, “Before that Companion Beast escaped into the planet, it accidentally swallowed something that didn’t belong to it. When you go, it’s naturally best if you can bring back the Companion Beast from that planet. If you can’t, kill it and retrieve what’s inside its body.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Xiao and Jiuyang answered the order and were about to leave when they were stopped by Holy God.</p>
<p>“Many terrifying existences in the dimension know about this matter. They will definitely think of a way to vie for it. Your mission won’t be that easy.” Holy God took out two items and gave them to Xiao and Jiuyang. “The Holy Artifact can raise your strength to the Heaven level, but it’s ultimately not the true Heaven level. You have to fuse with the Holy Artifact to truly advance to the Heaven level. This can help you.”</p>
<p>“Fuse with the Holy Artifact? That won’t do, right?” Jiuyang and Xiao were stunned.</p>
<p>The Holy Artifact belonged to the Holy Temple. They only wielded them, so how could they randomly fuse with it?</p>
<p>“No matter how good a Holy Artifact is, it can only be of use when it’s in your possession. Don’t worry. I’ve already discussed it with the Trajectory Holy Temple and the Sun God Holy Temple. You have already been allowed to fuse with the Holy Artifact. Only then can you truly fight Zhou Wen.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Lord Holy God.” Jiuyang and Xiao hurriedly bowed.</p>
<p>“Remember, no matter how strong your strength is, it will ultimately be up to you. Whether you plan on dealing with Zhou Wen or not, your abilities are also an important part,” said Holy God.</p>
<p>“We definitely won’t disappoint you.”</p>
<p>“Go. You don’t have much time left. Go to that planet after you succeed in the fusion.”</p>
<p>As he watched the two of them leave, a sneer suffused the corners of Holy God’s mouth. He muttered to himself, “How can a Holy Artifact be fused so easily? Even if you die, the Holy Artifact will still exist.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1630'>Chapter 1630 Bubble Music</h3>
<p>The cosmic creatures outside the planet didn’t rush into the atmosphere while Zhou Wen was observing the strange plant.</p>
<p>The rhythm formed by the bubbles sounded very pleasant. It wasn’t as exaggerated as the sound produced by the glacier cracks, but it was abnormally moving.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Wen had nothing to do, he suddenly had an idea. He summoned a Musical Note Sprite and used it to replicate a bubble’s music.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know music, the Musical Note Sprite had musical talent and abilities. Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s memory wasn’t bad. The Musical Note Sprite replicated the bubble’s sounds and quickly produced a contiguous piece of bubble music.</p>
<p>Bubbles constantly rose, but thankfully, Zhou Wen had enough Musical Note Sprites. He replicated them one by one, producing music that left him somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>The music was infectious. As Zhou Wen listened, he couldn’t help but tear up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was not a perceptive person when it came to emotions; he wasn’t a sentimental person. Even if others were moved to tears from listening to ordinary music, he didn’t feel anything. However, the simulated bubble music made him feel intense sorrow.</p>
<p>It was music that was close to despair and death. It had a suppressed anger, like a roar before death, or a knell before Death culled lives.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Essence Energy, just the music itself was infectious. It left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>This infectious force was unstoppable by any force. Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder couldn’t fend off the shock that penetrated deep into his soul. Zhou Wen listened for a while and had the urge to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he was extremely firm mentally. He immediately became wary and suppressed that thought.</p>
<p>What powerful music! Zhou Wen frowned slightly, but he still got the Musical Note Sprites to continue simulating the music and recording it.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours had passed. The Big Dipper instance dungeon had indeed respawned. Zhou Wen entered the dungeon and killed the Starlords one by one.</p>
<p>The first six Starlords didn’t drop Companion Eggs. When it came to the seventh Starlord Army Breaker, Zhou Wen deliberately didn’t use the Teacher Domain and entered Mizar Star Palace after his Essence Energy was depleted.</p>
<p>As he didn’t use the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen immediately felt something different after entering Mizar Star Palace. The stars in the cosmos shimmered with a demonic glow.</p>
<p>He summoned Golden Wyrm Scissors and aimed it at Starlord Army Breaker, but just as Golden Wyrm Scissors flew up, the starlight that filled the sky descended and instantly enveloped the entire Star Palace.</p>
<p>Golden Wyrm Scissors was sent flying as the blood-colored avatar was killed by the starlight. The phone screen turned black.</p>
<p>I see. Previously, the Teacher Domain enveloped the Star Palace and sealed the powers of those stars. That’s why Starlord Army Breaker looked so weak. Zhou Wen immediately came to a realization.</p>
<p>Ordinary people would have expended all their Essence Energy before entering the Mizar Star Palace. Although summoning Companion Beasts doesn’t require much Essence Energy, they still need some Essence Energy to support them. When the time comes, they probably won’t be able to summon a single Companion Beast, nor can they use Essence Energy Arts. Facing such terrifying starlight power, even a Heaven-level expert would probably die. Unless one’s body can withstand the starlight that filled the sky or can think of a way to resolve the problem of zero Essence Energy, they can only use powers like the Teacher Domain to kill Starlord Army Breaker. Zhou Wen immediately realized that the Mizar Star Palace was indeed terrifying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Teacher Domain could perfectly restrain Starlord Army Breaker. It made it extremely easy for Zhou Wen to kill him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still wanted to give it a try. If he didn’t use the Teacher Domain, was there any other way to kill Starlord Army Breaker? After trying a few times, the results weren’t ideal.</p>
<p>As he didn’t have any Essence Energy, he couldn’t use any Essence Energy Arts. He couldn’t even use the Chaos Egg for defence. Apart from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, there were no other Essence Energy Arts that could ignore such taboos.</p>
<p>If the Prisoned Dragon armor can improve further, I might be able to withstand the slaughter of the starlight with its Absolute Defense. Unfortunately… Zhou Wen had always wanted to raise Prisoned Dragon to the Calamity grade, but he hadn’t found a good solution.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen attempted to kill Starlord Army Breaker, the Musical Note Sprites continued simulating the bubble music according to his orders.</p>
<p>After simulating countless musical notes, the bubble music finally began to repeat. However, every time it repeated, the rhythm of the music became much faster, and the infectious feeling it produced became stronger.</p>
<p>The despair and dead silence would probably make ordinary people immediately have the thought of suicide.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen became accustomed to it after listening to it multiple times. He could even hum the tune without the Musical Note Sprite’s simulation.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any musical talent. All he could do was hum the right tune, but its infectiousness was far lacking.</p>
<p>In the end, he failed to come up with any other way to kill Starlord Army Breaker. He used the Teacher Domain to kill him to prevent it from affecting the respawn time of the other Starlords.</p>
<p>The respawn time of the Big Dipper instance dungeon was set according to the time of Starlord Army Breaker’s death. It respawned once every twenty-four hours. If Army Breaker didn’t die, the other Starlords wouldn’t respawn either.</p>
<p>After putting away his phone, Zhou Wen scanned the plant below and was surprised to discover that the leaves were withering.</p>
<p>The leaf at the bottom was already shriveled like a withered leaf. Soon, it fell from the stem and turned to dust in the water.</p>
<p>The leaf above also began to wither. Worried that something bad would happen, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Musical Note Sprites as a strange scene happened. After the Musical Note Sprites were unsummoned, the withering clearly slowed down.</p>
<p>Could it be… Zhou Wen summoned the Musical Note Sprites again and made them simulate the bubble music again.</p>
<p>Indeed, the leaves withered much faster.</p>
<p>How strange. The leaves’ withering speed is actually affected by music. Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was a good or bad thing for the leaves to wither faster.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen unsummoned the music sprites.</p>
<p>Now, the best situation for Zhou Wen was to keep the status quo. From this angle, it was naturally a good thing that the leaves withered slowly. Without the music of the Musical Note Sprites, the speed at which the leaves withered was indeed much slower. Zhou Wen estimated that all the leaves would wither in about fifty to sixty hours.</p>
<p>I hope Tsukuyomi can wake up before the leaves completely wither. Zhou Wen had a feeling that something major might happen when all the leaves withered and fell.</p>
<p>Time ticked by until the last leaf withered and fell, but Tsukuyomi remained unconscious. Zhou Wen stared intently at the remaining fruit atop the plant.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1631'>Chapter 1631 Little Trumpet</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was in his throat as he activated various domains. At the same time, he summoned his Companion Beasts, so that he could deal with anything that happened.</p>
<p>The last leaf had already fallen, leaving the peach-like fruit high up on a bent stem. It bobbed slightly along the water surface and bubbles rose from time to time. Crack!</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on the fruit before it opened up fully.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze to see what was inside the cracked fruit, but he realized that it was only the outer layer. Furthermore, it was split into three petals that slowly drooped out.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The fruit split apart layer by layer like a blooming flower. When the last layer cracked, he finally saw a hemispherical space in the middle of the fruit. A figure was inside.</p>
<p>The figure looked like a bee. It was only the size of a finger and its entire body was as black as black jade.</p>
<p>Strangely, there was a tiny, black trumpet-shaped object in the bee’s front claws. No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it looked like a mini suona.</p>
<p>At that moment, the bee was holding the tiny trumpet with its front claws. Its body was slightly hunched as it hid in the space inside the fruit. Bubbles rose from the mini trumpet. This was likely the source of the bubbles from before.</p>
<p>Could this fellow be this planet’s Companion Beast? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>As the fruit cracked, more and more bubbles floated out of the trumpet, speeding up the rhythm of the music.</p>
<p>The sound from the glacier rift grew louder and louder. The terrifying sound caused the glaciers on the planet to begin crumbling. Huge glacier rifts appeared on the planet as the entire planet seemed to tremble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got his Companion Beasts to separate the ice cavern from the glaciers outside. Tyrant Behemoth held up the entire ice cavern to prevent Tsukuyomi from being affected by the shock.</p>
<p>The atmosphere also produced visible ripples due to the sonic vibrations, as though it was about to fall apart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept observing the bee playing the trumpet and saw that it appeared to still be sleeping. It didn’t fly out of the space inside the fruit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Suddenly, an intense sound came from the atmosphere. Zhou Wen turned his attention and realized that a cosmic creature had finally rushed into the atmosphere. Under the high-speed impact, its body rubbed against the atmosphere, producing burning flames. However, there wasn’t only one cosmic creature that rushed into the atmosphere. Groups of cosmic creatures roared as they charged into the atmosphere from the cosmos. They were like meteors wrapped in flames as they rushed into the planet.</p>
<p>When it rains, it pours… Zhou Wen observed for a while and suddenly felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The cosmic creatures that rushed into the atmosphere didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A cosmic creature slammed into the planet, triggering an effect similar to an atomic bomb explosion. The shockwave swept through the rocks and glaciers and spread out in a ring shape. Everything was destroyed wherever it passed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly sensed that all the bones in the cosmic creature’s body had snapped. Its body had distorted and deformed from the collision. Blood spewed out from the wound that its bones pierced open alongside the shockwave.</p>
<p>This isn’t charging into a planet to snatch something, but courting death! Zhou Wen watched as the cosmic creatures committed suicide by slamming into the planet. The entire planet was filled with terrifying collisions and explosions.</p>
<p>Moments later, the huge planet was riddled with holes. It was difficult to find an intact area. It was as though it had been bombarded by thousands of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Many cosmic creatures slammed into the planet. Those that survived were mostly heavily injured. They struggled in the meteorite crater and began ripping apart their bodies in crazy self-mutilation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already discovered that the creatures that rushed in were all Terror-grade creatures. In the beginning, the five Calamity-grade creatures that occupied the nearby area in space didn’t rush in.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, these Terror creatures must have been affected by the bubble music and rushed in to commit suicide. Zhou Wen looked at the heavily damaged planet and the cosmic creature corpses everywhere and couldn’t help but shudder. He couldn’t help but size up the black bee again.</p>
<p>This fellow already has such a terrifying influence even before it wakes up. How terrifying will it be when it does? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but have a scene appear in his mind: a small black bee playing a suona-like trumpet. This scene that was supposed to appear adorable was filled with mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p>
<p>Countless creatures committed suicide as corpses were strewn across the land. Blood flowed like a river, and there was a hellish scene everywhere.</p>
<p>Should I think of a way to kill it before it wakes up? Zhou Wen already had such a thought. Once such a terrifying creature appeared, it would probably be no different from the apocalypse.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>After a round of suicidal attacks by cosmic creatures, the glacier rift no longer made a sound, but the tiny trumpet in the bee’s claw was still emitting bubbles.</p>
<p>Could it be that all of this wasn’t caused by the bee and the trumpet? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. After paying attention for a while, there was indeed no sound from the glacier rift.</p>
<p>The bee’s trumpet was still blowing bubbles normally without any changes. This raised a new question for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>In space, the cosmic creatures rushed into the planet again. The five Calamity creatures rushed in from different directions. This time, they didn’t commit suicide. They headed for the glacier rift.</p>
<p>However, they only arrived near the glacier rift and didn’t rush in directly. They each occupied a spot near the glacier rift and seemed to be on guard against each other.</p>
<p>Soon, through his scanning, Zhou Wen detected two figures rushing into the atmosphere. They were Xiao and Jiuyang.</p>
<p>Why are they here? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>The universe was boundless and there were many planets. Although there was a huge commotion here, it was insignificant to the universe. This place was extremely far from Earth. Unless one had interstellar teleportation abilities, even a Calamity-grade creature would take countless years to rush here from Earth.</p>
<p>It was definitely not a coincidence that Xiao and Jiuyang had appeared here. The Holy Land can’t be that resourceful, right? They know which planet’s Companion Beast is about to be born in the universe? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>“We came in time, thankfully. That Companion Beast hasn’t appeared.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but hear when Jiuyang spoke.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1632'>Chapter 1632 Toad Immortal</h3>
<p>“I wonder how strong the five Calamity-grade dimensional creatures are,” Xiao said as he observed the five cosmic creatures.</p>
<p>“Regardless of their strength, we have to take that Companion Beast back.” Jiuyang stared at the glacier rift and said, “Lord Holy God said that that Companion Beast is different from ordinary Companion Beasts. It won’t appear in a normal manner. It’s very likely that there won’t be a corresponding dimensional zone and it might rush out directly. When the time comes, I’ll deal with it. Try your best to help me hold back those dimensional creatures.”</p>
<p>“I’m not confident fighting five alone,” Xiao said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>“We can swap. You deal with that Companion Beast,” Jiuyang said indifferently. “Forget about it. I’ll try my best to hold them back.” Xiao pondered for a moment and shook his head.</p>
<p>The two of them discussed other details. As they hadn’t expected a human to appear here, they didn’t screen their conversation.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be blamed on them. This place was so far from Earth that humans couldn’t reach it even if they spent their entire lives. Furthermore, how was it possible for there to be a human here across the vast universe? Zhou Wen heard their conversation and roughly learned that their arrival wasn’t a coincidence. Holy God seemed to know the Companion Beast on this planet very well.</p>
<p>However, up to now, Zhou Wen hadn’t heard much useful information.</p>
<p>He only knew that there seemed to be something wrong with the Companion Beast on this planet and that it would rush out directly, but he didn’t hear Jiuyang or Xiao say what the problem was.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao and Jiuyang were discussing the details, they suddenly heard a loud bang. They hurriedly turned their heads and saw that the blue ribbon-like cosmic creature had rushed into the glacier rift.</p>
<p>As though it was contagious, the other cosmic creatures moved as well. They rushed into the glacier rift one after another and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao were taken aback. They never expected such a situation to happen when they came. Holy God only said that it was very difficult for this Companion Beast to appear, but he didn’t say that it could rush in.</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged looks before Xiao said, “Why don’t we go in and take a look?”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Jiuyang nodded slightly. The two of them headed for the glacier rift and soon vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched them enter the glacier rift and was somewhat tempted. However, he ultimately held back. He didn’t know when Tsukuyomi would be fine, so he definitely couldn’t take the risk.</p>
<p>Should I take her away from here? Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi, who was still absorbing the Moon Essence, and wondered if he should leave the planet.</p>
<p>The reason he hadn’t left previously was that Tsukuyomi couldn’t move, nor could she be stored in the chaos space. It was also impossible for him to carry out interstellar teleportation of the huge ice cavern. It would be too dangerous if they encountered terrifying cosmic creatures after bringing her into the cosmos.</p>
<p>However, this place was even more dangerous than the cosmos. Furthermore, most of the cosmic creatures in the planet’s vicinity were dead. The few Calamity creatures who weren’t dead had already entered the glacier rift.</p>
<p>Based on the present situation, the dimensional creatures in the nearby cosmos were probably drawn over. It wouldn’t be easy to encounter a cosmic creature nearby, so there shouldn’t be any danger.</p>
<p>He could find a nearby planet to settle down and wait for Tsukuyomi to return to normal.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could lift the ice cavern up, he heard another sound coming from the atmosphere. Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped and used Truth Listener to scan the direction of the sound.</p>
<p>A strange, fat person in a golden robe passed through the atmosphere and headed for the interior of the planet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person was rushing in the direction of Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully sized up the strange person. The robe on his body looked golden, but it wasn’t completely golden. Golden square-holed coins were embroidered with golden thread over black cloth. They even overlapped, revealing very little of the base fabric. Therefore, it looked like he was wearing a golden robe that covered his rotund figure.</p>
<p>His face was very fat, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. His cheeks were like two meatballs with standard dead fish eyes.</p>
<p>Is this a human? Zhou Wen felt that this guy’s aura was odd, as though he wasn’t human.</p>
<p>Seeing that the strange person was about to reach them and was still heading straight for their location instead of the glacier rift, Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Could this be Toad Immortal? Zhou Wen thought to himself. His aura was indeed similar to the toad, but it was somewhat different.</p>
<p>“Hand over the Moon Essence Basin and I’ll let you die a quick death.” The person in the coin robe came above the ice hole where Zhou Wen was and shouted hoarsely. His throat seemed to have been ground by sand paper, making his voice sound extremely unpleasant, like fingernails scratching the surface of metal. It gave one a headache.</p>
<p>It’s indeed him. Why did this fellow take human form? He really came at the worst possible time. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how to deal with the present situation.</p>
<p>Swan Immortal was with him, and Moon Essence Basin was with Tsukuyomi. With these two things, Toad Immortal could find them no matter where they went.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know what Toad Immortal valued more. If Toad Immortal thought more highly of the Moon Essence Basin, it would be impossible for him to lure Toad Immortal away.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can only fend him off head-on. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate when he saw that Toad Immortal seemed to have the intention to charge down. He used instant transmission and appeared outside the ice cavern to confront Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>“You finally dare to show yourself. You killed my body and snatched my Moon Essence Basin. Dying ten thousand times isn’t even enough.” Toad Immortal stared at Zhou Wen with his dead fish eyes as his golden pupils shimmered with killing intent.</p>
<p>Without giving Zhou Wen a chance to speak, Toad Immortal’s cheeks swelled up like two balloons. It made one worry that they would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>However, in the end, his cheeks reached the size of gym balls without exploding. Then, he spat at Zhou Wen, instantly forming a terrifying storm. Everything that stood in front of the storm was swept up.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was originally the best choice to deal with wind-elemental powers, but unfortunately, her level was a little low. No matter how strong her resistance against wind-elemental powers was, she couldn’t fight something that spanned so many levels.</p>
<p>After all, Toad Immortal was an existence at the Heaven level. The storm was just too powerful. Under the high-speed airflow, everything was torn apart. Furthermore, it enveloped a large area with almost no end in sight.</p>
<p>With a thought from Zhou Wen, a sword domain appeared out of thin air. Countless Sword Pills appeared around him as they faced the terrifying storm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1633'>Chapter 1633 Contest of Taboo Powers</h3>
<p>The Sword Domain produced Sword Pills without end, but in the storm, they were quickly reduced to Yin. A large number of Sword Pills vanished, unable to block the storm’s attack.</p>
<p>The Heaven-level wind is so powerful! Zhou Wen couldn’t retreat. At the very least, he couldn’t let the battle affect Tsukuyomi in the glacier below.</p>
<p>The Dragon King armor appeared as the eight Companion Beasts’ powers augmented Zhou Wen at the same time, raising his Strength greatly as his Sword Domain appeared again.</p>
<p>The galaxy-like Sword Pills reappeared in the storm and charged forward.</p>
<p>With the augmentation of the eight Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still inferior to Toad Immortal, but the effects of Sword Pill particles had something to show. After the Sword Pills in front of him vanished from the storm, they quickly changed from Yin to Yang and appeared again. The endless Sword Pills constantly struck the storm. Although the storm was stronger than the Sword Domain, as long as it couldn’t destroy the Sword Domain in one fell swoop, it would be blocked by the constantly reborn Sword Pills.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill particles could constantly be rejuvenated, but the storm couldn’t. After a period of time, the power of the storm weakened, and the power of the Sword Domain gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>“Eh!” Toad Immortal looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>He clearly felt that Zhou Wen’s strength was only at the Human Realm, but he had suddenly raised it to a level infinitely close to the Heaven level. This leap was somewhat exaggerated. Furthermore, the characteristics of the Sword Domain surprised him. It was virtually an undying power that was very rare even among Heaven-level creatures.</p>
<p>The torrent formed by Sword Pills tore through the storm and charged at Toad Immortal like a galaxy.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal sneered and opened his mouth again. However, this time, he wasn’t exhaling, but sucking</p>
<p>He opened his mouth and countless Sword Pill particles flew uncontrollably into it. The small mouth seemed to be able to devour everything. After the Sword Pill particles were sucked in, they immediately lost contact with Zhou Wen. This fellow still has his Void Devouring ability? It’s much stronger than the toad body from before! Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop attacking when he saw that it was useless no matter how many Sword Pill particles he had.</p>
<p>“How dare a mere human compete with the likes of an Immortal?” Toad Immortal said disdainfully as a golden beam seemed to flash from his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t see what it was, but he immediately summoned the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg was sent flying by something as solid Essence Energy Crystals appeared in large numbers. Many of the compressed and stacked numbers appeared. He’s actually not dead? Toad Immortal was slightly taken aback. In the next second, golden light flashed from his mouth again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen failed to see what it was again. He condensed the Sword Domain to protect himself when the Sword Pill particles were suddenly pulled away. A force tore through the Sword Domain and struck the Chaos Egg, sending it flying again.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>The golden light shimmered as it struck the Chaos Egg from different directions, sending it flying. The golden light was so fast that Zhou Wen could only see a shadow flash. He had no time to block it as he staggered from the strike. His reaction couldn’t keep up. Thankfully, the Chaos Egg was powerful enough to withstand the continuous attacks of the golden light without shattering.</p>
<p>This Toad Immortal seems even stronger than the Void Salamander! Zhou Wen thought about how he could defeat him. At the very least, he had to stall for time.</p>
<p>He hoped that if Toad Immortal continued attacking, he could accumulate a large number of high-level solid crystals and transfer them to foodie Companion Beasts like Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Toad Immortal didn’t give him such a chance. After striking a few times, he realized that he couldn’t shatter the Chaos Egg. The golden light revealed its form and wrapped around the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>It was a golden tongue that extended out of Toad Immortal’s mouth. After wrapping around the Chaos Egg, it suddenly retracted and pulled the Chaos Egg towards his mouth.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted quickly. Just as he was about to be swallowed, he used instant transmission to rush out.</p>
<p>“You also know spatial instant transmission. Let’s see how fast you can instant transmit.” Toad Immortal snorted coldly as his golden tongue flicked again, transforming into a golden beam that flashed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to use the Chaos Egg to block the golden tongue’s attack. At the same time, he activated the Teacher Domain. The golden tongue wrapped around the Chaos Egg again. As it pulled it into its mouth, it also used Void Absorption’s power to imprison Zhou Wen, preventing him from using spatial instant transmission to escape.</p>
<p>However, as he absorbed, he suddenly realized that Void Absorption’s power had decreased significantly. Unable to hold onto Zhou Wen, it allowed Zhou Wen to escape again using instant transmission.</p>
<p>After escaping again, Zhou Wen unsummoned Chaos Egg and used Transcendent Flying Immortal to raise his speed to its limits, leaving elegant arcs in the air. Toad Immortal’s tongue attacked several times, but it failed to touch Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain allowed Zhou Wen to know the trajectory of the tongue attacks. Transcendent Flying Immortal’s speed gave him the possibility of dodging. Toad Immortal was somewhat surprised. His Void Devouring and storm powers had clearly been weakened.</p>
<p>“Taboo power?” Toad Immortal rolled his eyes and sized up Zhou Wen with a frown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had almost shown everything he had. Apart from the Immortal Culling Sword, he didn’t have any other means. All he hoped for was to last a little longer.</p>
<p>During the battle, Zhou Wen consciously led the battlefield into the cosmos, but he couldn’t make it too obvious to prevent himself from being seen through by Toad Immortal; that would lead to him rushing straight for Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“You are still far from being able to use taboo powers against me.” As though confirming what power Zhou Wen was using, Toad Immortal snorted coldly and trembled. Thousands of golden beams shot out from his body.</p>
<p>The golden beams transformed into golden square-holed coins that flew in different directions. Like nails, they nailed into the void, turning the area into a money space. Zhou Wen immediately felt his Essence Energy rapidly vanish. He couldn’t maintain the power of the Sword Domain and the Chaos Egg and could only barely maintain the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain has met its match! Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem. Toad Immortal actually had powers similar to the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the other party’s strength had already reached the level of a perfect domain. The Teacher Domain was ultimately at the Human Realm. Due to the power of the eight Companion Beasts, the power of the Teacher Domain was very close to the Heaven level, but it was only close. It was still much weaker than the true Heaven level.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen found it difficult to even use spatial instant transmission.</p>
<p>“I never expected to encounter a human who can use taboo powers. However, I’m a progenitor when it comes to using taboo powers. Yours remain wanting,” Toad Immortal said with a sneer.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1634'>Chapter 1634 Each With Their Own Scheme</h3>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, they probably wouldn’t be able to use Companion Beasts in Toad Immortal’s Money Domain.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen could still maintain a portion of his abilities and the use of his Companion Beasts. He still maintained the connection between the Demon Dragon King armor and the eight Companion Beasts. This was all thanks to the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Although the Teacher Domain wasn’t as powerful as the Money Domain, it wasn’t completely suppressed; it even had a certain effect on Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>Despite both being at the Heaven level, the Void Salamander was only good at the power of void lightning, but Toad Immortal’s power was more varied and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>As for Jiuyang, Xiao, and company, they were actually about the same as Zhou Wen. They were all at a pseudo Heaven level. They were still a distance away from the true Heaven level.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s tongue swept over like lightning. Zhou Wen used the Transcendent Flying Immortal he had figured out and moved gracefully. He dodged Toad Immortal’s tongue attacks again and again, and even seized some opportunities to counterattack.</p>
<p>However, Toad Immortal was far from what Jiuyang and company could compare with. Not only was he powerful, but his combat techniques had also reached the sublime realm. With him holding the advantage, even Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t suppress him.</p>
<p>The concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal! Toad Immortal recognized the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal at a glance as though he was very surprised. His strange eyes sized up Zhou Wen in surprise as he thought to himself, What’s wrong with this human? Not only is he proficient in taboo powers, but he’s also at the Zenith Heaven True Immortal realm, one of the highest realms of us Immortals… Is this fellow really human? Could it be some big shot of the Immortal race who descended and he’s deliberately plotting to make things difficult for me?</p>
<p>However, after watching for a while, Toad Immortal dispelled this thought. Zhou Wen’s Zenith Heaven True Immortal concept was only at the beginner level. If a true Immortal big shot were to descend using possession, it shouldn’t be at this level.</p>
<p>A human can actually reach such a level. To be able to comprehend the concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal at such a level, it would be too unreal if not for Immortal big shots pulling the strings from behind. The more Toad Immortal thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. He suspected that there was some big shot behind Zhou Wen who was scheming against him.</p>
<p>Back at the Queen Mother of the West, he had fallen for a scheme. As the saying went, once bitten, twice shy. The more Toad Immortal thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Toad Immortal hesitated. He didn’t dare attack Zhou Wen with all his might. He held back a little and secretly observed, hoping to find any clues.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s reputation wasn’t good. The legend of a toad lusting after a swan’s flesh had tarnished his reputation. However, in terms of strength, Toad Immortal’s strength wasn’t as terrible as the rumors said. Otherwise, he would have died at the Queen Mother of the West’s place.</p>
<p>How could it be as simple as being banished to the mortal realm after molesting the Swan Fairy at such a place? Furthermore, he had brought out the Moon Essence Basin, a treasure of the Moon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He could clearly sense that the pressure Toad Immortal exerted on him had weakened significantly.</p>
<p>Although Toad Immortal still had the advantage, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the pressure of being on the brink of death. He didn’t know what Toad Immortal was thinking or what motives he had, but it was a good thing for him.</p>
<p>Although the Teacher Domain was still far inferior to Toad Immortal’s Money Domain, it wasn’t just a taboo domain. The true strength of the Teacher Domain lay in the word “Teacher.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the Teacher Domain was constantly accumulating the trajectories of the Money Domain. It was as though it was completing a jigsaw puzzle as it gradually pieced together the corresponding trajectories of the Money Domain. After successfully completing all the trajectories the last time, he gained an additional “Great Void Lightning Art” on the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Later on, he attempted to piece together the trajectories of Xiao and Old K’s powers, but he failed.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that for the Teacher Domain to condense an Essence Energy Art, the domain had to be at least a Heaven-level perfect domain. It might even be even more stringent. Toad Immortal’s strength was stronger than the Void Salamander’s, and it was even stranger. Zhou Wen felt that it was highly likely that he could turn the Money Domain into an Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t cultivate the Essence Energy Art. However, the process of condensing an Essence Energy Art was also needed to evolve the Teacher Domain. It would make the Teacher Domain stronger. After condensing the Void Lightning Grand Art, the Teacher Domain could seal the formerly unsealable Heaven-level void lightning domain. Then, after converting the Money Domain into an Essence Energy Art, it should be able to seal Toad Immortal’s Money Domain. When the time came, Zhou Wen’s chances of defeating Toad Immortal would be much higher.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal wasn’t in a rush to go all out, much less Zhou Wen. The two of them had their own ulterior motives. The battle looked intense, but in fact, it wasn’t that dangerous.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao rushed into the glacier rift. After passing through the glacier layer, they realized that there was still a stone abyss beneath them. It led deep into the core. The interior shimmered as their vision and various Essence Energy detection abilities were screened. It was unknown how deep it went.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a strange blue light would flash below. It was from the blue ribbon-like Calamity creature that was flying towards the abyss.</p>
<p>“Strange!” Xiao stared at the abyss and frowned.</p>
<p>“What did you discover?” Jiuyang asked.</p>
<p>“From the music that tempted dimensional creatures to commit suicide, the Companion Beast on this planet should be music-type. However, do you see any traces of music-type powers in the abyss?” Xiao pointed into the abyss. “It’s indeed a little strange. I don’t see any music-type powers. There’s only a power that’s close to death…” Jiuyang sensed for a moment before continuing, “However, my Sun God Light is the nemesis of that dark aura of death.”</p>
<p>Xiao nodded. “In that case, let’s go in and take a look first. Don’t let those Calamity creatures snatch the initiative. It will be troublesome if the Companion Beast is devoured by them.”</p>
<p>Jiuyang nodded slightly as the Sun God Light on his body bloomed before he charged into the abyss.</p>
<p>Xiao followed behind Jiuyang and used the power of the Sun God Light to ward off the psychedelic light.</p>
<p>After descending countless meters into the abyss, the psychedelic glow in front of them suddenly vanished. They found themselves inside a huge spherical space.</p>
<p>Is this the core of the planet? Jiuyang looked around and realized that there was a white egg-shaped object floating in the middle of the huge spherical space.</p>
<p>The egg-shaped object looked very strange. The white outer shell was like a membrane of some creature. It looked very thin and was almost transparent. One could even see a blurry light seeping out of it.</p>
<p>On the membrane-like outer shell, there were many black blood vessels. They varied in thickness and were distributed under the outer shell, but they protruded in a pronounced manner. They looked like blood vessels no matter how one looked at them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the entire egg was like a heart as it shrank and expanded. As this continued, the blood vessels became thicker and thinner. There was even liquid flowing in them, making it look ugly and bizarre.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1635'>Chapter 1635 Fighting for the Companion Egg</h3>
<p>The five Calamity creatures from before were surrounding the egg-shaped object. The blue ribbon of light circled above. The two unicorn wolves occupied the left side, and the strange fish was on the right.</p>
<p>Far away from Jiuyang and company was the ball of magnetic storms. From time to time, tentacles would extend out as though they wanted to sweep away the white egg-shaped object, but they didn’t seem to dare. They quickly shrank back.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao’s arrival immediately alarmed the Calamity creatures. They constantly sized them up. Once they realized that they were too weak or had any weaknesses, they would probably immediately attack to reduce their competitors. “Can you see the situation inside?” Jiuyang asked Xiao when he saw that the Calamity creatures seemed to be afraid of each other and didn’t take the initiative to attack them.</p>
<p>His combat strength was very strong, but he was far inferior to Xiao’s proficiency in some special techniques.</p>
<p>Xiao’s eyes suffused a demonic glow as his pupils turned white. He resembled a pupil-less blind man.</p>
<p>After staring at the white egg-shaped object for a few seconds, Xiao’s eyes returned to normal. He looked at Jiuyang and shook his head. “I can’t see what’s inside. I can only sense that there’s a lifeform inside.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be wrong. This is the core of the planet. The planet’s Companion Beast should be hatching here. I reckon the rift abyss we entered is the path opened up by the parasitic Companion Beast when it rushed in,” Jiuyang guessed after some thought.</p>
<p>“That’s right, but those five Calamity creatures don’t look simple. It probably won’t be easy to snatch the Companion Beast inside from their jaws. Furthermore, the Companion Beast inside can appear at any time. When the time comes, we won’t just be facing five Calamity creatures,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Act according to plan then. Contract the Companion Beast before it appears, or kill it ahead of time,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious. If we go over now, we will probably be besieged by those Calamity creatures.” Xiao shook his head slightly, gesturing for Jiuyang not to go over for the time being</p>
<p>“Being Calamity-grade creatures, their intelligence can’t be too low. Even some creatures with low intelligence have already accumulated quite a bit of experience and intuition. No one wants to become the target of the masses, but they don’t know that if that Companion Beast appears, it will be difficult to say who ends up as the meal,” Jiuyang said with a cold snort when he saw that none of the five Calamity creatures were willing to charge forward.</p>
<p>“Therefore, we have to think of a way to incite them,” Xiao said as he looked at the white egg-shaped object.</p>
<p>“How?” Jiuyang asked.</p>
<p>“Just wait here for me. I’m better at incitement.” As Xiao spoke, he took a step forward and vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already in front of the white egg-shaped object. He extended his hand and slapped it.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Xiao was the closest to the electromagnetic storm. Before he could touch the white egg-shaped object, the tentacles in the electromagnetic storm flailed wildly. Every tentacle carried a terrifying electromagnetic storm, causing the electromagnetic storm that only covered its body to spread out and envelop half the planet’s core.</p>
<p>Before the electromagnetic storm landed on Xiao, he easily turned around and vanished. Large swaths of the electromagnetic storm missed him while most of the electromagnetic storms landed on the white egg-shaped object. With a series of crackling sounds, the white egg-like object rapidly shrank to about half its original size as though it had been injured.</p>
<p>With this, the other four Calamity creatures were immediately unable to sit idle. All of them carried terrifying domain powers, hoping to control the white egg-shaped object in their domains.</p>
<p>The black-and-white wolves’ domains were very strange. The black wolf’s domain power was a black barrier, while the white wolf’s domain power was a white barrier.</p>
<p>When they stood together, the intersection of the black and white barriers turned transparent as though it had vanished.</p>
<p>The strange fish flicked its tail, and its graceful tail that resembled a cloud blotting out the sky covered the white egg-shaped object from all directions.</p>
<p>The blue ribbon of light was even more direct. With a flash, it wrapped around the white egg-shaped object.</p>
<p>Apart from the strange fish’s domain power being relatively slow, the domain powers of the other four Calamity creatures descended almost at the same time. Together with the Calamity creature that had used the electromagnetic storm, all sorts of domain powers intertwined, instantly producing a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>All sorts of forces constantly collided, producing continuous explosions and shockwaves. The entire space shook as cracks appeared on the hard rocks that supported the interior space of the planet. Extremely hard rocks constantly fell.</p>
<p>The five Calamity creatures were sent flying. No one could snatch the white egg-shaped object.</p>
<p>“Such powerful destructive power failed to break its outer shell and deal a certain level of damage to it!” Xiao had hidden behind Jiuyang at some point in time and said with a smile.</p>
<p>The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body bloomed and blocked the shockwaves that surged at them. He said in surprise, “Two of these five Calamity creatures seem to be at the Heaven level. The other three are also powerful Hell-level creatures. Furthermore, the domain powers of the three Hell-level creatures are very special.” “Those at the Hell level are fine, but it’s probably hard to tell if we can handle the Heaven-level ones,” Xiao said as his expression suddenly changed. In the middle of the explosion, the white egg-shaped object shrank to the height of a person. The membrane that was almost transparent had turned into the color of milk. It looked much thicker.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the terrifying energy blast from before failed to injure it.</p>
<p>“What kind of Companion Beast is this planet’s original Companion Beast? Is its eggshell’s defense that high that two Heaven-level and three Hell-level forces failed to injure it at all?” Xiao frowned.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, your incitement sucked.” Jiuyang wasn’t looking at the white egg-shaped object. Instead, he was looking at the few Calamity creatures because they were in a brawl.</p>
<p>The monster in the electromagnetic storm and the strange fish were clearly at the Heaven level. Their strength was extremely terrifying. The black and white wolves were probably still at the Hell level, but when their domain powers were stacked together, they could actually withstand the power of a Heaven-level creature. They weren’t taken advantage of by the strange fish and the monster in the electromagnetic storm.</p>
<p>The blue ribbon-like Calamity creature was likely at the Hell level, but its strength was extremely strange. It shuttled through the various domains without being too affected.</p>
<p>The five monsters fought each other, hoping to snatch the white egg-shaped object and have a good meal. However, in the battle, they didn’t notice that tiny cracks had appeared on the white egg-shaped object.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1636'>Chapter 1636 Birth of the Companion Beast</h3>
<p>I can’t wait any longer. Jiuyang realized the anomaly on the white egg-shaped object. He knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. If he waited any longer, the Companion Beast inside would probably be born.</p>
<p>The Sun God Light erupted with a resplendent divine glow as Jiuyang’s body seemed to transform into a beam that tore through spacetime. He instantly arrived in front of the white egg-shaped object, hoping to penetrate it with the Sun God Light.</p>
<p>However, before his Sun God Light could touch the white egg-shaped object, he saw several huge tentacles extend out from behind and block it.</p>
<p>The Sun God Light collided with the tentacles and forcefully severed the tentacles that were wrapped in electromagnetic force, reducing them to pieces. However, in the next second, electromagnetic light flashed as the tentacles that had been sliced into pieces gathered together again and swept towards Jiuyang.</p>
<p>While Jiuyang was fighting the tentacle monster, Xiao secretly instant transmitted to the back of the white egg-shaped object and extended his fingers to slice it apart.</p>
<p>A blue light instantly swept over at an unbelievable speed. Xiao had no choice but to retract his finger. Otherwise, his finger would have been severed by the blue light before it touched the white egg.</p>
<p>The other Calamity creatures rushed over as well, plummeting the scene into further chaos.</p>
<p>Xiao dodged the blue light and the strange fish’s attacks several times, but he failed to get close to the white egg-shaped object.</p>
<p>“Help me open up a path.” The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body became even more resplendent. His entire body seemed to turn into light as every strike was like a hydrogen bomb exploding. However, when such a powerful force struck the transparent barrier formed by the combination of the black and white wolves, it failed to break through. He ultimately failed to charge over.</p>
<p>“It’s better if you help me open up a path.” Xiao’s figure flashed past like a phantom, luring the strange fish and the blue light to Jiuyang’s vicinity.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s whole body emitted divine light that nearly enveloped the entire planet’s interior space. The few Calamity creatures were attacked, and they couldn’t focus on Xiao’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Xiao finally found an opportunity. Like a ghost, he arrived in front of the white egg-shaped object again. Before the Calamity creatures could stop him, he pointed his finger at it.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao thought he was about to succeed, the white egg-shaped object suddenly shattered like glass. The white fragments scattered and turned into a sticky white liquid from touching anything. Although Xiao was the closest, his reaction was the fastest. Before the white fragments touched him, his figure vanished as he retreated. When he appeared again, he was already extremely far away. He dodged left and right, missing the flying white fragments.</p>
<p>The other Calamity creatures and Jiuyang were also affected. The tentacle monster used its tentacles to whip the white fragments, and some of them stuck to its tentacles. The strange fish used its tail to sweep away the fragments, but it also got some white liquid stuck onto it.</p>
<p>The black and white wolves were protected by a barrier, blocking all the white fragments. White mucus covered the barrier’s exterior.</p>
<p>The blue light was the fastest and dodged all the white shards.</p>
<p>The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body was too intense. Everything that came close vaporized. The white fragments were no exception. They couldn’t approach him at all.</p>
<p>The Calamity creatures collectively looked at the white egg-shaped object and saw a white Companion Beast floating in front of it.</p>
<p>It looked very strange. Its entire body was snow-white like jade. Its body was upright, and its legs were like a goat’s, but its upper limbs were like a hairless monkey’s. Its nails were extremely sharp and emitted a jade luster.</p>
<p>Its eyes were huge, and its nose was sharp and short. When it pursed its lips, one could only see a slightly curved arc. There was no hair on its head, and the back of its head was abnormally large. It drooped down to its back like a horn.</p>
<p>There was no hint of vitality from it, as though it was a lifeless jade statue. However, its eyes were moving. Its vertical pupils that resembled feline eyes were slowly turning left and right as though it was observing the Calamity creatures and Jiuyang and company.</p>
<p>The tentacle monster’s huge tentacles that swept towards the Companion Beast carried an electromagnetic storm with them.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast didn’t dodge when it saw the huge dragon-like tentacles sweep over with electromagnetic forces. It only stood there and looked at it in a daze.</p>
<p>The tentacles had already reached the Companion Beast and even wrapped around its body, but the Companion Beast remained motionless.</p>
<p>The Calamity creatures, Jiuyang, and Xiao, who had been watching, felt regret. If they had known that the Companion Beast would be so slow to the uptake, they would have been the first to rush forward.</p>
<p>They had thought that the tentacle monster was too rash just now, but from the looks of it, it was too late for them to rush over.</p>
<p>Just as the Companion Beast was about to be pulled into the electromagnetic storm and the Calamity creatures were filled with regret, the tentacles suddenly came to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>The tentacles froze in midair as though they were trembling. The tentacles that bound the Companion Beast slowly released.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was wondering what had happened, they suddenly saw something white seeping out of the tentacles. It was like white paint and white spots rapidly spread across its body.</p>
<p>At first, it looked like it was suffering from leukoplakia. Most of the areas on its back turned white and even had a jade- like luster. Soon, all the tentacles and even the body in the electromagnetic storm turned into white jade.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the tentacle monster. The strange fish was experiencing the same thing. Large amounts of white spots appeared on its tail before rapidly spreading out, spreading from its tail to its body.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the strange fish had been trying its best to escape the white contagion, but its strength failed to stop anything. Soon, its entire body was dyed white, turning into a jade-like white fish.</p>
<p>“Things aren’t looking good!” Xiao frowned. “Don’t tell me those two fellows…” Before Jiuyang could finish his sentence, he saw the tentacle monster and the strange fish let out strange cries at the same time. They came to the Companion Beast’s side like a monster version of two sidekicks.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang exchanged looks. They knew that things were going south. Among the five Calamity creatures, two Heaven-level creatures were controlled by the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“As expected of an existence that can parasitize the interior of a planet,” Xiao sighed. He never believed that it was an easy task to complete. The Companion Beast was forced to be born before it had fully developed. It had even escaped the capture of many experts during the deity battle and parasitized the planet. Xiao didn’t believe that such an existence could be easily killed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1637'>Chapter 1637 Terrifying Companion Beast</h3>
<p>The Companion Beast only watched without any intention of moving.</p>
<p>The controlled electromagnetic tentacle monster and strange fish lunged at Jiuyang and company fiercely. Their strength didn’t change at all; they even seemed stronger. A large electromagnetic storm descended as Jiuyang condensed the Sun God Light. The collision with the electromagnetic storm triggered a terrifying energy explosion. There were dazzling light spots everywhere. It was so dazzling that one couldn’t even open their eyes.</p>
<p>The strange fish’s tail that covered the sky descended, enveloping the black and white wolves, the blue ribbon of light, and Xiao.</p>
<p>The blue ribbon of light was too fast. In a flash, it rushed out of the tail’s range. Xiao’s figure phased away and vanished like a ghost. The black and white wolves weren’t fast enough. They could only raise the barrier and forcefully block the strange fish’s tail.</p>
<p>The muslin-like tail enveloped the barrier. Although it couldn’t crack it, the tail enveloped the barrier and constantly tightened. The barrier shrank bit by bit.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation wasn’t looking good, the blue ribbon of light headed straight for the exit. It followed the passageway through the abyss to the outside world and rushed out without looking back. “Xiao, are you confident?” Jiuyang asked as he fought the electromagnetic tentacle monster.</p>
<p>“Let’s give it a try. That fellow’s strength is probably more terrifying than we expected.” As Xiao spoke, he charged at the newly-born Companion Beast like a phantom.</p>
<p>Although Xiao came from the Trajectory Holy Temple, he was proficient in the various techniques of the six Holy Temples. He could even use the various famous techniques of the Federation.</p>
<p>At the instant he instant transmitted to the Companion Beast, Xiao’s entire body moved. Every part of his body turned into a terrifying killing weapon.</p>
<p>Even a finger or tongue turned into terrifying weapons of murder.</p>
<p>Coupled with his strange movement technique, Xiao delivered countless attacks in an instant. Fingers, palms, fists, elbow, shoulder, knees, legs, and feet. All sorts of attacks rained down on the Companion Beast’s white jade-like body like a storm. It struck every inch of its body countless times. Every strike carried terrifying Yin power that penetrated its body. Perhaps it was because it didn’t react in time, the Companion Beast didn’t show any resistance. Its body retreated repeatedly before it was sent flying by Xiao’s punch.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s body flew out and slammed into the stone dome, creating a huge crater as its body sank into the shattered rocks.</p>
<p>Its body was embedded in the rocks, but it didn’t struggle. Its feline-like eyes stared straight ahead as though it wasn’t focused. It was unknown what it was looking at.</p>
<p>Xiao had no intention of stopping. He instantly appeared in front of the Companion Beast and threw a barrage of punches at its face.</p>
<p>Just as the phantom-like fist was about to land on the Companion Beast’s face, the fist shadows that filled the sky suddenly vanished. A claw grabbed Xiao’s fist.</p>
<p>Xiao tried his best to escape the claw, but his wrist felt like it was about to snap. The fist held by the claw remained motionless.</p>
<p>This was no trifling matter. Xiao’s other arm and legs moved as his body attacked the Companion Beast in an extremely strange manner. Every joint in his body seemed to contain immense explosive power.</p>
<p>Before Xiao’s attack landed on the Companion Beast, the Companion Beast’s fist suddenly exerted strength as it raised Xiao’s body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Xiao’s body spun uncontrollably as he was slammed into the rocks. Blood spewed out of his mouth as his bones emitted cracking sounds. It was unknown how many had been shattered.</p>
<p>At some point in time, the Companion Beast had already drilled out of the rocks. It floated in the air and looked at Xiao who had been smashed into the rocks.</p>
<p>Its feline-like eyes gradually began to glow as it stared at Xiao with a strange smile.</p>
<p>Xiao also stared at it. He felt an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>Xiao had experienced too many storms. He knew when things only looked dangerous and when it was really dangerous. Even when he entered Lake Frustration, he didn’t feel that he was in such grave danger.</p>
<p>“Xiao, be careful.” Jiuyang wanted to rush over to help, but the electromagnetic tentacle monster held him back fearlessly. No matter how Jiuyang struck, the electromagnetic tentacle monster’s body would gather together again before fusing into one.</p>
<p>It was as if it wasn’t a living creature at all, but a collection of countless iron sand particles. Due to the existence of electromagnetism, no matter how its body was destroyed, it could be sucked back and reformed as a whole.</p>
<p>They were both at the Heaven level. Although Jiuyang’s offensive strength was far stronger than the electromagnetic tentacle monster after absorbing the Holy Artifact, one didn’t need to defend at all and attacked with all its might. The other had to take into account many things. Even though he had the advantage, he couldn’t escape the entanglement of the electromagnetic monster any time soon.</p>
<p>Xiao heard Jiuyang’s warning, but it was too late. In fact, he had already begun moving his body, hoping to use the power of the Trajectory to traverse the void and pull away from the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, just as his body was about to enter the void, a claw grabbed his neck. His body that had already turned into an illusion seemed to have no corporeal body. One of his feet had now stepped into the void and was pulled out.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The claw that grabbed Xiao’s neck pressed him into the rocks. Xiao’s entire body sank into the rocks again, causing the hard rocks to splatter everywhere.</p>
<p>Following that, the Companion Beast’s entire body seemed to turn into a killing weapon. Fingers, palms, fists, feet, legs, knees, elbow, etc. landed on Xiao like a storm.</p>
<p>Just like a replica of Xiao’s bombardment of the Companion Beast, every inch of Xiao’s body crackled from the Companion Beast’s attacks. All his bones were fractured.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that Xiao’s Trajectory power was unable to free him from his present predicament. He was crushed there and could only bear the brunt of the dense barrage of attacks.</p>
<p>“Wa!” Blood spewed out of Xiao’s mouth as his body distorted and deformed. He sank into the rocks and no longer looked like a human.</p>
<p>“Xiao!” Jiuyang was alarmed. Although they had already expected the Companion Beast’s abilities to be very high, they never expected them to be this high.</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>After fusing with the Holy Artifact, Xiao was already a true Heaven-level existence. Furthermore, with Xiao’s abilities, he was top-notch among Heaven-level existences. It was unimaginable that he would be thrashed like this.</p>
<p>“Don’t come over.” Jiuyang was just about to rush over and attract the Companion Beast’s attention when he heard Xiao’s voice.</p>
<p>Xiao’s voice was definitely not a result of pessimistic self-sacrifice. His voice didn’t have the down and out feeling of a loser, nor did it have the weakness it should have. In any case, it had a terrifying madness.</p>
<p>Jiuyang looked at Xiao in puzzlement and realized that there was still blood at the corner of his mouth, but his eyes were somewhat terrifying. His eyes seemed to be filled with madness.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1638'>Chapter 1638 Xiao’s Emotions</h3>
<p>Jiuyang was slightly stunned. He had always thought that Xiao was the kind of person who wouldn’t reveal any of his emotions no matter what situation he faced. Even when facing death, Jiuyang had never seen him show any abnormal emotions. It was as if death to Xiao was as casual as heading home for a nap. Saints underwent a cruel period of cultivation. Every Saint was very strong, but that didn’t mean that every Saint had astonishing talent. Instead, the untalented and unaccomplished Saints would have long been eliminated.</p>
<p>Therefore, to outsiders, as long as they were Saints who stepped out of the Holy Lands, they appeared very strong. However, they didn’t know how cruel this was.</p>
<p>Jiuyang clearly remembered seeing Xiao when they were young.</p>
<p>Back then, Xiao was a backup Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple, and he was a backup Saint of the Sun Holy Temple. They rarely had the chance to meet, but the Six temples would carry out a joint test every once in a while. All the reserve Saints in the six temples would participate in the test together. The people who came in last in the test would be directly eliminated.</p>
<p>Nobody knew where the eliminated Saints went; in any case, they would never be seen again.</p>
<p>Jiuyang himself was slow to warm up and he accepted new things very slowly. Therefore, his ranking was very low every time. There was once when he almost fell into the elimination ranks.</p>
<p>It was only then that he noticed Xiao,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>Xiao was about the same age as him. Back then, he was still a child, only a little more than ten years old. In the past, Jiuyang didn’t notice Xiao because the better a candidate’s grade was, the closer they would stand to the front during the six temples’ joint test.</p>
<p>Jiuyang had always been at the back, and Xiao used to stand in front. However, Xiao was standing behind Jiuyang this time. This was the first time that Jiuyang had seriously paid attention to Xiao.</p>
<p>It was very dangerous back then. Xiao was only one spot away from being eliminated. All the backup Saints after Xiao were eliminated and were never seen again.</p>
<p>Back then, a child—who was also ranked at the back and was relatively familiar with Xiaoasked, “Xiao, your combat abilities are so impressive that you can at least rank in the top three. Why did you lose?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m not good at using my left hand.” Xiao’s answer puzzled Jiuyang-who was standing beside him.</p>
<p>The child from before was also very puzzled. He asked, “Does your ability to use your left hand have anything to do with whether you can win?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to use my left hand to defeat all the reserve Saints, so I only used my left hand. However, I lost very badly. But from now on, I will only use my left hand until I defeat all the reserve saints in the six temples’ joint test,” Xiao replied.</p>
<p>When Jiuyang heard this, he thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>In such a cruel competition, if Xiao had only used his left hand—which he was not good at</p>
<p>—to fight, he would probably end up dying very tragically. At a critical moment of life and death, he would definitely be forced to use his right hand.</p>
<p>However, it was only during the next six temples’ joint test that Jiuyang realized that Xiao was not joking. In that tragic battle, Xiao indeed did not use his right hand. In the entire joint test, Xiao only used his left hand. His right hand was not used at all.</p>
<p>Xiao naturally lost miserably. He didn’t even win a single round.</p>
<p>This was also very normal. Which surviving Saint wasn’t talented and willing to work hard? Furthermore, they were too young, so the means they could learn were very limited. Back then, it was very difficult to widen the gap between them.</p>
<p>If Xiao had fought seriously, it was not impossible for him to be in the top three or even number one. However, he kept using his non-dominant left hand to fight.</p>
<p>Others had practiced their dominant hands for more than ten years, but he had only practiced his hand for a month. How could this be compared?</p>
<p>Jiuyang originally imagined that Xiao would definitely use his right hand to fight at the final moment, but he didn’t. Xiao didn’t use his right hand even when he fell into the elimination brackets.</p>
<p>Jiuyang watched helplessly as this happened. He was truly puzzled.</p>
<p>Xiao could clearly live and clearly win, so why didn’t he use his right hand? The rule of not using his right hand was a rule he had set himself. He could completely not abide by it. No one would laugh at him. In fact, few people knew about this matter.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you use your right hand?” Jiuyang secretly asked Xiao before Xiao was taken away.</p>
<p>“I said I’d only use my left hand, so I’ll only use my left hand,” Xiao answered very easily as though he wasn’t the one about to be eliminated.</p>
<p>If Holy God hadn’t appeared to protect Xiao back then, Xiao’s skeleton would have probably turned to ashes by now.</p>
<p>From then on, Jiuyang would pay attention to Xiao from time to time. However, no matter when it was, no matter how dangerous the situation was, he didn’t see Xiao flare up. It was as if he was a robot that was following a program without any emotions.</p>
<p>However, Xiao now had such a crazy expression. Jiuyang had never seen such emotions before. He was somewhat worried that Xiao had already lost his composure. That would really be dangerous. He probably wouldn’t even have the chance to escape.</p>
<p>“You can’t take my life yet.” Xiao’s eyes were as crazy as a devil’s, but his voice was terrifyingly cold.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast ignored Xiao as it once again charged at him like a storm. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s attacks were blocked by Xiao.</p>
<p>He didn’t dodge; instead, he blocked all of them head-on. At such a close distance and with such unpredictable and lightning-like attacks, Xiao blocked all of them.</p>
<p>His reaction speed seemed to have reached an unbelievable level. Even the attack near his face was blocked by Xiao.</p>
<p>No… It’s not just fast… It’s more like Xiao has long sealed off all possibilities… No matter how the Companion Beast attacks, it will ultimately result in one path-being blocked by Xiao… Amazing… Jiuyang’s eyes flickered as though he found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>He had always believed that his combat strength and concepts were the strongest among all the Saints, but the crazy Xiao had shattered his understanding and made him suspect himself.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Xiao’s combat skills weren’t weaker than his. His concepts were even stronger than his. This was somewhat different from the Xiao he knew.</p>
<p>Xiao’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit, but his actions were calm like a machine. He didn’t make any mistakes in such a crazy battle.</p>
<p>How does he do it? Jiuyang was alarmed and somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>This was almost different from the Xiao he usually knew, but he was clearly Xiao. It was impossible for it to be fake.</p>
<p>What puzzled Jiuyang even more was that if this was Xiao’s true strength, why hadn’t Xiao used such an ability when they attacked Zhou Wen?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1639'>Chapter 1639 Identical</h3>
<p>In the Li family’s backyard, a beautiful boy crawled through a dog hole and said to another boy, “Laughing Li, do me a favor.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Laughing Li asked the beautiful boy.</p>
<p>“Bury me in your garden,” the beautiful boy said with a serious expression. “Why?” Laughing Li looked at the beautiful boy expressionlessly as though he wasn’t surprised at all.</p>
<p>If other children heard this, they would definitely be very surprised, even shocked and afraid. However, Laughing Li was an exception. This was because he knew the beautiful boy in front of him. He knew that there was no need to be surprised at anything he did because he definitely had his reasons.</p>
<p>If it didn’t make sense, then it must be that this world didn’t make sense. It definitely wasn’t that the beautiful boy didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>“I want to try to see what it’s like to be a dead person,” the beautiful boy said.</p>
<p>“You will really be a dead person if you’re buried,” Laughing Li curled his lips and said. “I won’t; I’ve already learned the breathing catheter. As long as I’m not buried too deep, I won’t die.” The beautiful boy ran to a small clearing in the garden and grabbed a handful of soil. He shook it and said, “They won’t let me try it at home. I can only try it at your place. Quickly come and bury me.”</p>
<p>Laughing Li walked over expressionlessly and dug away the soil with the beautiful boy.</p>
<p>It was originally used to plant Chinese roses, but it was temporarily empty because they hadn’t bought a suitable species.</p>
<p>The two of them dug a pit that was about two feet deep. The beautiful boy entered the pit to have a feeling of it. The length was suitable, so he said to Laughing Li, “Laughing Li, find a bamboo tube and stick it in my mouth. Then, bury me. I’ll use the bamboo tube to breathe…”</p>
<p>After a long time, the two of them finally buried the beautiful boy. Only half of the bamboo tube was exposed.</p>
<p>Laughing Li reached out to give it a try. Only when he could sense the breathing through the bamboo tube did he heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. In the beginning, Laughing Li was still very worried. From time to time, he would go over to test to see if the beautiful boy was still breathing; he was afraid there would be none.</p>
<p>However, he later realized that the airflow in the bamboo tube was very rhythmic and long. It was likely not a big problem.</p>
<p>According to their agreement, Laughing Li needed to dig out the boy 72 hours later.</p>
<p>However, on the first night, something strange happened.</p>
<p>Laughing Li was used to sleeping alone from a young age. It wasn’t that he was willing to sleep alone, but he still had two younger brothers whom his mother had to take care of. With them sleeping on each side, he would have nowhere to sleep.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Laughing Li wasn’t someone who would wheedle. He wasn’t too young, so he got his own room early on.</p>
<p>Not long after Laughing Li fell asleep, he was suddenly woken up by a strange sound. He opened his eyes in a daze and realized that there was someone standing by his bed.</p>
<p>There was plenty of moonlight today, so he could see that the figure was a child about his age. Laughing Li thought that the beautiful boy had crawled out by himself, so he rubbed his eyes and asked, “Tianyou, why did you crawl out by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Tianyou, why did you crawl out by yourself?” The moment the figure spoke, Laughing Li jumped in fright. He jolted and woke up completely.</p>
<p>The figure wasn’t just mimicking him. Even his voice and tone were identical. For a moment, Laughing Li even suspected that he was the one speaking</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Laughing Li sat up immediately and leaned against the wall. He stood on the bed and sized up the figure warily.</p>
<p>As there was only moonlight and it came from behind the figure, Laughing Li couldn’t see his face. However, the more he looked at the outline, the more he felt that it resembled him. He couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” The voice sounded again, one identical to Laughing Li’s voice and tone.</p>
<p>Laughing Li stared at the silhouette and suddenly threw a punch at his face.</p>
<p>The silhouette tilted its head slightly and dodged Laughing Li’s fist. At the same time, it threw a punch at Laughing Li’s face.</p>
<p>Laughing Li failed to dodge the punch and ended with a bleeding nose.</p>
<p>However, he ignored it and continued throwing punches at the figure. He used all his strength, hoping to leave a mark on the figure.</p>
<p>However, the figure’s speed and strength were clearly much stronger than Laughing Li’s. He easily dodged Laughing Li’s attack.</p>
<p>Thanks to dodging Laughing Li’s fist, the figure had his side facing the moonlight. Laughing Li immediately saw his appearance.</p>
<p>That face was identical to his. It was as though it was carved from the same mold. Even the painful expression from Laughing Li’s bleeding nose was replicated by that face.</p>
<p>Laughing Li wasn’t frightened or surprised. He only shouted and pounced at the child who looked like him. His pounce was easily dodged by the child. Furthermore, no matter how he shouted, there was no reaction from the outside. It was as though he was the only one left in the entire Li family compound. Could it be that I’m dreaming? No, it’s not a dream. This definitely isn’t a dream. Laughing Li calmed down and pounced at the child again. He knew that his strength and speed were much weaker than the child’s, but he had to leave something on the child. Otherwise, he would be silently replaced. No one would know that Uncrying Li was no longer the former Uncrying Li.</p>
<p>Laughing Li didn’t know what kind of existence it was or why it was doing such a thing, but he knew very well what he himself was capable of.</p>
<p>He lunged again and again, but the boy dodged all of them. His punches and kicks were easily blocked. He failed to injure the boy, but he was hit many times.</p>
<p>Every time he showed a painful expression when he was injured, the boy would mimic it like a puppet. “Dad… Mom… Butler…”</p>
<p>“Dad… Mom… Butler…”</p>
<p>Laughing Li shouted, and so did the boy. He imitated his voice perfectly. Even Laughing Li himself couldn’t tell that it was voices from two different people.</p>
<p>Laughing Li decided to shut up because he already knew that shouting was useless. If it was useful, his family would have long come to save him.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you shouting?” The boy finally spoke when he saw Laughing Li hold back his words. Furthermore, there was no expression on his face.</p>
<p>Laughing Li remained silent as he pounced at the boy with all his might. Even if it was just a scratch, he wanted to leave something on the boy.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to scream? Then I’ll do it for you,” the boy said coldly as he suddenly raised his leg and kicked Laughing Li’s chest. Laughing Li couldn’t dodge in time and was kicked to the ground.</p>
<p>However, he gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. He even tried his best to control the expression on his face to prevent the muscles on his face from changing.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1640'>Chapter 1640 You’re A Fool</h3>
<p>“Can you endure the pain? I want to see how much you can tolerate.” The boy kicked Laughing Li again and again. He even stepped on Laughing Li’s fingers and crushed them bit by bit.</p>
<p>Yet, as a ten-year-old boy, he didn’t even grunt under such torture. His face twitched unnaturally as his forehead was covered in cold sweat. His eyes were bloodshot and his eyeballs were about to pop out.</p>
<p>However, it was obvious that Laughing Li was trying his best to control his expression. He tried his best not to let his expressions and reactions be mimicked by the boy who looked like him.</p>
<p>No matter how the boy tortured Laughing Li, his expression didn’t change much. Apart from the pain in his body that made his face twitch uncontrollably, it was difficult to find any other expression on Laughing Li’s face.</p>
<p>There was no sign of anger or hate on his face. The boy only saw mockery and disdain in Laughing Li’s eyes.</p>
<p>This seemed to strike a nerve in the boy, causing anger and violence to appear on his expressionless face. He directly stepped on Laughing Li’s head, leaving it covered in blood. He refused to stop.</p>
<p>“Haha…” Despite being tortured like this, Laughing Li laughed happily.</p>
<p>Looking at the laughing Laughing Li, the boy couldn’t help but be taken aback. He really didn’t understand why Laughing Li could still laugh so happily. Shouldn’t Laughing Li be crying bitterly at such a time? Shouldn’t he be filled with resentment and anger? Shouldn’t he hate him to the core? Shouldn’t he be horrified and uneasy?</p>
<p>None of this happened. Laughing Li was only laughing. Furthermore, he was laughing very happily. It was a joy that came from the bottom of his heart, not an act. There was even a hint of smugness in his smile.</p>
<p>For some reason, when he saw Laughing Li laughing, the boy’s heart burned with anger. As he stomped on Laughing Li’s face, he asked through gritted teeth, “What are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>“I’m laughing at you… Laughing at how you don’t get it at all…” Laughing Li’s mouth was covered in blood as he spoke intermittently. As there was too much blood, his words were hardly discernible.</p>
<p>“What don’t I get?” The boy lowered his head and approached Laughing Li, hoping to hear what he was saying. “That you’re a fool!” However, the moment the boy approached Laughing Li, Laughing Li suddenly opened his mouth and spat a mouthful of blood on the boy’s face. The boy subconsciously closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Just as his eyes closed, Laughing Li’s headbutted him in the chin, causing the boy’s chin to distort as he leaned his head back.</p>
<p>At that moment, Laughing Li seemed to go mental. He didn’t care about his injuries or if his bones were broken. His bloody palm slammed into the boy’s face.</p>
<p>Laughing Li’s palm deformed from the impact. His already fractured fingers were distorted beyond recognition.</p>
<p>However, Laughing Li ignored all of that. Like a lunatic, he rushed forward and punched and kicked the boy. He even bit him with his teeth.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the boy managed to resist, but it was unknown if he was frightened by Laughing Li or if he was punch-drunk. The boy, who was clearly stronger than Laughing Li in terms of strength, speed, and technique, was beaten until he screamed repeatedly. He even wanted to escape, but how could he? His body was covered in blood. It was impossible to tell if it was his or Laughing Li’s.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>An old man in a Saint costume appeared in the room and sent Laughing Li, who was beating up the boy, flying with a slap. Laughing Li’s body shattered the window and fell into the garden outside. He rolled far away and landed on the ground. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.</p>
<p>However, seeing that he was covered in blood and many parts of his body had broken bones, he was probably doomed.</p>
<p>“Useless.” The old man glared at the boy on the ground and cursed coldly.</p>
<p>The boy jolted in fright. He immediately got up and kowtowed to the old man. “Your Excellency… No… Don’t kill me… Don’t…”</p>
<p>“The Holy Land spent so much time, energy, and resources to nurture you, but you are inferior to a child from an ordinary family clan. What’s the point of having you?” the old man said with a cold expression.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency… I… I can do it… I was just careless… I definitely won’t make the same mistake again…” The boy kowtowed in horror.</p>
<p>“Forget it. It’s troublesome to do another round of nurturing. Continue your mission. You should know what to do next, right?” As the old man spoke, he looked at Laughing Li, whose fate was unknown. “For you to be incapable of killing the boy you are to replace and to require my help, it’s a disgrace to the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“There definitely won’t be a next time,” the boy hurriedly said with his head lowered.</p>
<p>“Quickly dispose of his corpse,” the old man said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I’ll do it right away.” The boy hurriedly rushed into the garden and took out a small bottle. He poured the liquid in the small bottle onto Laughing Li.</p>
<p>Laughing Li’s clothes were immediately corroded by the liquid as his flesh and bones began to melt. “A terrifying figure is approaching. Hide the corpse until he completely disintegrates. I’ll hold back that person,” the old man suddenly said with a heavy expression as he looked out into the darkness.</p>
<p>The boy hurriedly picked up Laughing Li’s corpse and looked around. Finally, he pushed it into the grass and hid the corpse there. When the boy turned around to take a look again, he realized that the old man had already vanished. He looked around uneasily for a while before the old man finally returned.</p>
<p>“Who was it?” the boy hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Hmph, it’s none of your business. Has the corpse disintegrated?” the old man said coldly.</p>
<p>The boy hurriedly pulled away the grass and looked again. He realized that there was only some foul liquid in the grass. Apart from that, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>“It’s done,” the boy said.</p>
<p>The old man took a look and nodded when he saw the liquid. “From today onwards, you are the eldest young master of the Li family, Uncrying Li, understand?” “Yes, Your Excellency. I’m Uncrying Li,” the boy hurriedly said.</p>
<p>The old man reached out his hand and did a swipe, lifting up the smelly liquid along with the vegetation and soil. He sucked it into a huge cloth bag before turning to leave.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, how should I contact you?” the boy hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to contact me. You are Uncrying Li. Uncrying Li is you. Only when the Holy Land needs you will you be a Saint. When you are needed, a Saint will naturally summon you.” With that said, the man left the Li family compound.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, after the old man left, the Li family, which was like a land of the dead, suddenly seemed to return to normal. There were sounds of night insects everywhere, and even the sound of people getting up at night to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>“I’m Uncrying Li… I’m Uncrying Li…” the boy muttered to himself a few times before treating his wounds and cleaning up the glass window shards…</p>
<p>After he returned to his room, in a pool not far from the grass, a beautiful boy secretly surfaced with the heavily injured Laughing Li.</p>
<p>Looking at Laughing Li’s room, the beautiful boy hesitated for a moment before leaving the Li family’s residence with the dying Laughing Li on his back.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1641'>Chapter 1641 Mental Mutation State</h3>
<p>It’s been a long time since I felt like this. Xiao recalled the past.</p>
<p>Ever since he impersonated Xiao, he had never revealed this side of himself. He had been acting as his impersonator.</p>
<p>There were even times when Xiao questioned who the real Laughing Li was.</p>
<p>Only when he completely let go of himself did Xiao truly feel that he was still Laughing Li, the elite who could match An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>His eyes were bloodshot and his hair and beard were disheveled, but his eyes were extremely cold. He was like a devil that had escaped from the Hell of Avicinaraka. Having suffered hundreds of lifetimes of torture, he was filled with boundless anger, but his heart was already dead.</p>
<p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>
<p>Xiao’s Strength and Speed gradually exceeded his limits. He fought the Companion Beast crazily without being at a disadvantage. His attacks were even more ferocious than the Companion Beast’s.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Amidst countless punches and kicks, Xiao managed to be slightly faster than the Companion Beast. He punched the Companion Beast in the face, sending it flying. It slammed into the rocks, causing a large area to collapse.</p>
<p>Xiao’s figure instant transmitted in front of the Companion Beast as his fists and feet bombarded it, constantly blasting its body into the rocks.</p>
<p>It was unknown how many attacks landed on the Companion Beast. When Xiao threw his final punch, the Companion Beast’s body slammed through the rocks, penetrated the ground, and flew into the air.</p>
<p>Xiao rushed out as well. He hovered in midair and looked at the Companion Beast lying in midair as though all its bones had been broken.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao was about to charge forward again, he realized that there were two people fighting in the air not far away.</p>
<p>Why is he here? Xiao was taken aback when he saw Zhou Wen. He never expected to see Zhou Wen here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was fighting Toad Immortal when he saw two things spew out from the ground. He was given a fright. On careful look, he saw that one of them was Xiao. The other creature looked very strange. He didn’t know what it was, but it was clearly a Companion Beast with a pure energy body. Alright, there’s indeed an ambush. You want to scheme against me? Dream on. Seeing Xiao and the Companion Beast rush out, Toad Immortal confirmed his thoughts. He retreated at high speeds as the money that filled the sky returned to his robe.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal looked down at the situation below and determined what to do next.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t chase after Toad Immortal. He also observed Xiao and the Companion Beast as he guessed what was going on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always believed that the bee in the plant was the Companion Beast born from this planet.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case. The Companion Beast that rushed out of the ground with Xiao was likely the Companion Beast born from this planet.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>As the few of them had their own thoughts, the Companion Beast slowly moved. It cracked its neck as its distorted body gradually returned to normal. It stood up again, its body still as perfect as before as though it had never been injured.</p>
<p>Xiao frowned slightly. He had indeed used all his strength. Even the secret he had hidden had been exposed. Every strike’s offensive strength was enough to kill a Heaven-level expert.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast in front of him had recovered so quickly despite suffering so many attacks. Such a recovery ability was unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, what happened next surprised Xiao even more.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s body tensed up as its muscles showed. Its entire body seemed to be filled with explosive strength. Its eyes turned red, but it didn’t seem to have any emotions. This… This is… Xiao looked at the changes in the Companion Beast’s body and revealed a look of horror.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s present state was identical to his. This left Xiao very surprised.</p>
<p>After all, this state of his wasn’t a type of talent or Essence Energy Skill, but an effect on his body through a mental mutation.</p>
<p>This ability was the result of a mutation in the psyche. It couldn’t be cultivated, so it didn’t expend Essence Energy when used. It was Xiao’s unique ability.</p>
<p>Even An Tianzuo hadn’t mastered this ability. Although Xiao had already told him everything about how to enter this state, An Tianzuo just couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>Later, according to An Tianzuo’s analysis, Xiao’s mental state was related to his experience and thoughts. It wasn’t something others could imitate.</p>
<p>However, the Companion Beast had also entered such a state. It left Xiao in disbelief.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s figure flashed as it charged at Xiao. Its Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Essence Energy had entered a special mental state like Xiao’s. Its various abilities had increased again.</p>
<p>Although Xiao remained in the same state, he was once again suppressed. He was surpassed by Companion Beasts in every aspect.</p>
<p>An independent Heaven-level Companion Beast? After Toad Immortal saw the situation below, his eyes immediately revealed a look of greed.</p>
<p>The Companion Beasts produced by planets were somewhat different from the Companion Beasts on Earth.</p>
<p>Only humans could use the Companion Beasts on Earth. As for Companion Beasts born from the celestial bodies in the universe, they weren’t limited to humans.</p>
<p>Haha, my luck is here. I never expected a Companion Beast from this planet to appear! Toad Immortal immediately became greedy when he saw the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This was also his true nature. Back at the Queen Mother of the West, if he hadn’t been greedy, he wouldn’t have been sealed in a mortal body like the toad and suppressed for so many years.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal had suffered greatly once after all, so he had learned his lesson. Although his greed ate at him, he still watched and didn’t rush forward immediately.</p>
<p>If it were in the past, Toad Immortal would have long rushed forward and swallowed the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal didn’t want any Companion Beasts, but the pure energy in the Companion Beast’s body was extremely beneficial to him. It made him drool.</p>
<p>Although Xiao was suppressed by the Companion Beast, he still managed to put up a resistance.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast used abilities that he was best at. He knew those abilities too well. With this understanding, Xiao could circle around them.</p>
<p>Battles aren’t as simple as imitating. A sneer appeared on Xiao’s lips.</p>
<p>He roughly understood that this Companion Beast had the ability to imitate other creatures, but Xiao didn’t believe that such an imitation could defeat him.</p>
<p>I’ve been in the Holy Land for so many years. It was in no way a waste of my youth. The coldness in Xiao’s eyes intensified as his eyes turned crazier.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1642'>Chapter 1642 Sometimes True, Sometimes Fake</h3>
<p>Xiao wasn’t Laughing Li from back then after all. What he had learned over the years was no longer as simple as a mental state.</p>
<p>His person, mind, body, and abilities were much more mature than before. When he was young, he might have relied on his mutated mental state to seek out a possibility for victory, but to the present Xiao, that was no longer the case.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast attacked again. With the augmentation of the mental state, his speed was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>And just as his fist was about to touch Xiao, Xiao took half a step back. When the Companion Beast’s fist struck Xiao’s body, it passed through him as though Xiao’s body didn’t exist. It was just an illusion.</p>
<p>Xiao’s figure really began to dissipate like a phantom. Almost at the same time the phantom began to dissipate, another Xiao appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast and threw a punch at the back of the Companion Beast’s head.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s reaction was extremely fast. He swung his arm and slammed his elbow into Xiao’s fist.</p>
<p>However, when his elbow collided with the fist, he was surprised to discover that his elbow went through Xiao’s fist. He didn’t sense any force. It was also an illusion.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the phantom that should have dissipated struck the Companion Beast’s face, causing it to fall backward. “Sometimes real, sometimes fake. You learned my psyche mutation, but you didn’t learn my true thoughts. It’s just an empty shell.” Xiao, who was behind the phantom, spoke out. At the same time, he struck the Companion Beast that was leaning back and leaped up to slam his knee into its waist.</p>
<p>The sound of the Companion Beast’s back snapping could almost be heard. The Companion Beast that was about to snap was sent flying into the sky like a meteor.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao was about to chase after the Companion Beast using his Trajectory movement technique and deliver a fatal combo when he saw a golden light flash in the sky, the Companion Beast that was thrown into the air was caught by the golden light and pulled into Toad Immortal’s mouth.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal finally found an opportunity after watching for a long time. He wrapped his tongue around the Companion Beast and swallowed it.</p>
<p>“I never expected such a pleasant surprise. I actually managed to devour a Heaven-level Companion Beast so easily.” Toad Immortal was somewhat smug as he looked at Xiao and said, “Punk from the Trajectory Holy Temple, go back and tell Holy God that Toad Immortal will happily accept this Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>With that said, Toad Immortal ignored Xiao and turned to fly towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After all, to him, killing Zhou Wen to retrieve the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan was most pertinent. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to devour a Heaven-level Companion Beast and slowly digest its energy.</p>
<p>“Did I say that you can leave?” As Toad Immortal flew towards Zhou Wen, he heard Xiao’s cold voice.</p>
<p>“Why? Can’t you accept this?” Toad Immortal turned around and rolled his strange eyes as he looked at Xiao.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I can’t accept it, but I want to kill you. You shouldn’t have taken something that belongs to the Holy Temples.” As Xiao spoke, his figure flashed in front of Toad Immortal. His sharp fingers slashed at Toad Immortal’s throat.</p>
<p>A golden light flashed from Toad Immortal’s mouth as his tongue wrapped around Xiao’s arm. However, he realized that it was only an illusion. As for Xiao, he had already appeared behind him. His fingers were like hooks as he grabbed at Toad Immortal’s fat head.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal waved his hand and the golden-robed sleeve blocked Xiao’s five fingers. However, it was only an illusion. The phantom-like Xiao continued slashing at Toad Immortal’s throat.</p>
<p>A golden light flashed from Toad Immortal’s mouth as he cleaved away Xiao’s arm. At the same time, he sneered and said, “Such a trick is fine against that stupid Companion Beast. You are still far from being able to injure me…”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Before Toad Immortal could finish his sentence, he realized that the Xiao in front of him was also an illusion. A third Xiao appeared on the other side of his body and punched Toad Immortal in the face.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s face distorted as his body sank with his face. He slammed into the glacier, causing a large area to collapse.</p>
<p>What a powerful fellow. He’s already at the Heaven level, right? Zhou Wen frowned inwardly.</p>
<p>The last time he could defeat the three Saints in a one-on-three battle was because they had yet to truly advance to the Heaven level. However, from the looks of it, not only was Xiao already at the Heaven level, but his abilities and realm seemed to be much stronger than before.</p>
<p>How long has it been? This fellow has actually grown to such a stage. Are the Holy Land’s resources really that abundant? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>Jiuyang had already rushed out. He wasn’t in the mood to fight the dimensional creatures controlled by the Companion Beast. As he fought, he retreated. He rushed out of the planet and saw the battle between Xiao and the Companion Beast, as well as the scene of Toad Immortal being sent into the glacier.</p>
<p>What is this fellow up to? Jiuyang looked at Xiao, feeling increasingly puzzled.</p>
<p>The abilities Xiao displayed were much stronger than his normal standards. This wasn’t because his strength had increased. However, the power brought by the Holy Artifact wasn’t enough to make Xiao undergo such a huge change.</p>
<p>The only way possible was if Xiao already had a very high realm and ability, but if that was the case, Jiuyang found Xiao harder to figure out. He even had some doubts.</p>
<p>The dimensional creatures controlled by the Companion Beast rushed out and held back Jiuyang again. Jiuyang wasn’t in the mood to fight them. Although he had no choice but to deal with them, most of his attention was on Xiao.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The glacier collapsed, forming a huge hole. A shockwave spread out from the glacier as a figure rushed out like a cannonball. It was the livid Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>His cheeks swelled up. Being a Heaven-level attack, the punch had not been light. Toad Immortal was also at the Heaven-level, so he wasn’t strong enough to ignore attacks of the same level.</p>
<p>“You’re dead.” Toad Immortal’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he stared at Xiao and enunciated each word clearly.</p>
<p>“You’re right. If you don’t spit out that Companion Beast, you’re indeed dead,” Xiao said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Don’t think that you can challenge me just because you’ve learned some tricks from the Trajectory Holy Temple. You will soon know how foolish you are.” As the toad spoke, its body emitted a golden glow. Countless square-holed coins shot out like stars. They were nailed into the nearby void, enveloping a large area into the Money Domain.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1643'>Chapter 1643 Treasurefall Money</h3>
<p>Under the envelopment of the Money Domain, all sorts of powers were immediately sealed. Even Essence Energy couldn’t circulate normally.</p>
<p>Xiao’s figure immediately sank as though he had fallen out of a special trajectory. When he moved again, he couldn’t leave behind any afterimages. Even the Essence Energy circulation in his body stopped, preventing him from releasing it.</p>
<p>“You are still too young to fight me.” Toad Immortal’s tongue moved again as he instantly appeared in front of Xiao and swept towards his neck.</p>
<p>Xiao was unable to enter the void trajectory again, making it difficult for him to dodge the tongue. He could only use his hand to block the golden light.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao’s body was sent flying. The tongue chased after him like a bolt of lightning and lashed around him.</p>
<p>Xiao tried his best, but he could barely block the tongue’s attacks. He didn’t have the strength to counterattack as he was constantly struck.</p>
<p>This was still a result of him maintaining his mental mutation state. Otherwise, he might have been swallowed by the tongue. Jiuyang and the electromagnetic tentacle monster were also within the range of the Money Domain. Under the influence of the Money Domain, the Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body immediately converged. It could only circulate in his body without being released.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic storm around the electromagnetic tentacle monster vanished, revealing its true body.</p>
<p>What was previously thought to be a huge octopus wasn’t the case. Its main body was like a meat pillar made of intertwined tentacles. The tentacles extended out from the meat pillar. And in the middle of the meat pillar, there was a huge eyeball wrapped around it. Its wheel-like pupil was looking left and right, making it look extremely strange.</p>
<p>This was because its body had turned into white jade. It looked like a white jade statue, but it wasn’t that terrifying. If it was its original color and appearance, it would probably be even more terrifying.</p>
<p>Although the electromagnetic monster and Jiuyang couldn’t release their Essence Energy, their Essence Energy was still circulating in their bodies. It wasn’t completely sealed.</p>
<p>This was thanks to them being at the Heaven level. If it were some low-level creature, their Essence Energy would probably be completely sealed, crippling them.</p>
<p>Xiao wanted to summon his Companion Beasts, but he realized that he couldn’t. The sealing effects of the Money Domain were just too powerful.</p>
<p>Ding! Toad Immortal suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a golden beam. Xiao had already sensed that the golden beam was somewhat different from the tongue from before, but he had no chance of dodging. All he could do was deliver a punch.</p>
<p>When the fist collided with the golden light, Xiao saw that it was a golden ancient coin. The ancient coin seemed to contain a huge suction force as it stuck to his fist. Instantly, Xiao felt the Essence Energy in his body vanish without a trace. The last bit of resistance was wiped away.</p>
<p>“Die.” Toad Immortal’s tongue swept over again.</p>
<p>Without Essence Energy, although Xiao’s physical strength wasn’t bad, it was difficult for him to withstand Toad Immortal’s tongue. Although he tried his best to push the tongue away, he was still pulled towards Toad Immortal’s mouth.</p>
<p>Even if Jiuyang wanted to save him, most of his strength had been sealed. He couldn’t rush over in time, much less with the electromagnetic monster still pestering him.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao was about to be pulled into Toad Immortal’s mouth, he suddenly saw a saber beam slash down and strike the middle of Toad Immortal’s tongue. Although this strike failed to sever Toad Immortal’s tongue, it still left a wound. Alarmed and in pain, Toad Immortal retracted his tongue, allowing Xiao to be liberated.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen?” Xiao retreated and saw that the person who had struck out was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, how about we cooperate and kill him first?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s strength was extremely terrifying. Zhou Wen could barely survive alone. After Toad Immortal finished off Xiao, it would probably be him and Tsukuyomi next.</p>
<p>The enemy of an enemy was a friend. As long as he could kill Toad Immortal, Zhou Wen didn’t mind temporarily cooperating with the Saints of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Xiao was straightforward as he agreed. At the same time, he said, “You can crack his power?”</p>
<p>Jiuyang also wanted to know the answer to this question. Everyone had clearly seen Zhou Wen slash out a saber beam in Toad Immortal’s domain. Clearly, he wasn’t suppressed by the domain’s power.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao wanted to know if Zhou Wen could only exempt himself or if he could help them. If Zhou Wen could only exempt himself, they couldn’t recover their combat strength, making any form of cooperation useless.</p>
<p>“Probably, but I have a condition. After killing him, everything on him will belong to me,” Zhou Wen said as he dodged the furious Toad Immortal’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Deal.” Jiuyang was still somewhat hesitant, but Xiao agreed immediately.</p>
<p>“Xiao…” Jiuyang wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Xiao.</p>
<p>“Nothing is more important than survival. Let’s survive first,” Xiao said with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Jiuyang didn’t say anything else. In fact, he didn’t have the time to say anything else. The electromagnetic monster continued attacking crazily. Without the power of the Sun God Light, Jiuyang’s strength was much weaker than the huge electromagnetic monster.</p>
<p>When Toad Immortal saw that Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy wasn’t sealed, and how he was stronger than before, killing intent surged in his heart. He opened his mouth and spat out another Treasurefall Money, turning it into a golden beam that smashed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing Xiao’s outcome, Zhou Wen already knew how terrifying the Treasurefall Money was. How was it possible for him to allow it to stick to him? He used instant transmission to dodge the Treasurefall Money’s attack.</p>
<p>As the Teacher Domain simulated more and more trajectories of the Money Domain, it almost reached completion. Although he couldn’t condense an Essence Energy Art, it had a faint restraining effect on the Money Domain, allowing Zhou Wen to obtain more power over it.</p>
<p>However, at the instant Zhou Wen phased into existence, the Treasurefall Money slammed into his forehead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt the Essence Energy in his body vanish as he fell from the sky.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s physical strength and reaction were still present. He somersaulted and landed on the ground, preventing his head from hitting the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wanted to gather his Essence Energy, but he couldn’t control them. Apart from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder circulating, the other Essence Energy Arts were completely sealed. The Dragon King armor on his body was sealed as it transformed into a tattoo that returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen’s connection with the other eight Companion Beasts was instantly severed, greatly weakening Zhou Wen’s strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out to remove the ancient coin on his forehead, but it seemed to be stuck to his bones. Unless Zhou Wen chopped off his head, it was impossible for him to remove the ancient coin.</p>
<p>“I was once invincible in the Mythical era. To think a few mere humans have the delusion of fighting me,” Toad Immortal said disdainfully as he brandished his tongue again and swept it at Zhou Wen, who had lost his Essence Energy.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal felt that Zhou Wen was the greatest threat. Although Zhou Wen’s strength was the weakest, he was also proficient in taboo powers. He likely posed the greatest threat to him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1644'>Chapter 1644 Cover</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s strength was at best at the Human Realm. Without the help of the Dragon King armor and eight Companion Beasts, he was far from being capable of fighting Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>A golden beam flashed as Zhou Wen retreated with all his might, but he failed to dodge in time.</p>
<p>Bang! A figure rushed over and slammed into the golden light from the side, causing it to deviate from its trajectory, allowing Zhou Wen to escape the calamity.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s tongue stabbed into the glacier to the side, piercing a huge hole in it. The ice shattered and splattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retreated and avoided the ice shards. He swept his gaze and realized that the person who had struck the tongue was surprisingly Xiao.</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to stall for long. You have to make the best use of time.” With that said, Xiao charged to the other side without waiting for Zhou Wen to answer. He raised a huge block of ice and smashed it at Toad Immortal in midair.</p>
<p>Make the best use of time? What the hell can I make it into? My Teacher Domain is affected by the ancient coin, so its effects are nearly zero. There’s no point in making the best use of time! Zhou Wen thought to himself, but Xiao was crazily grabbing ice blocks and throwing them at Toad Immortal. He was clearly buying time for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jiuyang had also lured the electromagnetic monster elsewhere. At the same time, he was creating space for himself. Toad Immortal faced the ice blocks and opened his mouth to suck at them. All the ice was swallowed by him, unable to pose any threat to him.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s tongue flicked over. Xiao couldn’t withstand the blow with his strength and was sent flying. He slammed into the rocks, cracking them. The bones in his body emitted a cracking sound as blood seeped out of his mouth uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued retreating rapidly, hoping to distance himself from Toad Immortal, but Toad Immortal was just too fast. Without the augmentation of the eight pets, Zhou Wen was far inferior.</p>
<p>Before he could retreat, Toad Immortal’s tongue wrapped around him again. Zhou Wen pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits, but he only managed to circle around it twice. He couldn’t circle around it a third time.</p>
<p>Just as the tongue was about to entangle Zhou Wen, a huge boulder suddenly flew over and smashed into him, sending him tumbling away.</p>
<p>Although the smash wasn’t light, Zhou Wen ultimately dodged the tongue’s attack.</p>
<p>In the distance, Jiuyang held a stone in his hand as he smashed it at Toad Immortal’s tongue. Although it was instantly shattered by the tongue and failed to be of any use, it gave Zhou Wen some time.</p>
<p>Jiuyang himself was swept up by the electromagnetic monster’s tentacles and smashed into the ground. Large rocks shattered as his body bounced up with the rubble. Blood bloomed like a flower.</p>
<p>It’s useless even if you protect me! Zhou Wen immediately broke out into a cold sweat when he saw that they wanted to protect him.</p>
<p>Before he was hit by the Treasurefall Money, he could indeed be of use. Now, he was truly useless.</p>
<p>The power of the Teacher Domain was suppressed to the point of it being unable to leave his body. Ignoring the fact that he couldn’t help Jiuyang and Xiao escape the influence of the Money Domain, even Zhou Wen couldn’t escape it. The only way to escape the present predicament was for the Teacher Domain to turn the power of the Money Domain into an Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had tried for quite some time and had nearly pieced together all the trajectories of the Money Domain, but he was just short of completing it.</p>
<p>He failed to piece it together despite having so much time. He didn’t have the confidence to do it in such a short period of time and in such a difficult environment.</p>
<p>However, Jiuyang and Xiao seemed to place all their hopes on Zhou Wen. Even though they suffered injuries, they constantly protected him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded. He was between laughter and tears.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on!? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as he circulated the Teacher Domain. At this moment, he had no choice but to try his best.</p>
<p>In order to protect him, Xiao and Jiuyang suffered serious injuries. It didn’t seem like they could last much longer. Hurry up and piece it to completion! Zhou Wen circulated the Teacher Domain with all his might to analyze the Money Domain, but the effects were very poor. He couldn’t figure out the last part he lacked.</p>
<p>This darn ancient coin! As Zhou Wen ran through the ruins made of glaciers and rocks, he cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been suppressed by this ancient coin, he wouldn’t be in such a sorry state.</p>
<p>Ancient coin… Wait a minute… Zhou Wen seemed to figure out something as he used the Teacher Domain to analyze the ancient coin on his forehead.</p>
<p>Xiao was already in a tragic state, but Jiuyang was in an even worse state. After all, there was still a Heaven-level electromagnetic monster pursuing him. Jiuyang was already severely injured. He was swept up by the electromagnetic monster as tentacles wrapped around his body and pulled him into the pillar of flesh.</p>
<p>Xiao was helpless. He had just been sent flying by Toad Immortal’s palm. All his bones seemed to have fallen apart. Ignoring saving Jiuyang, he couldn’t even protect himself.</p>
<p>Am I really going to die here!? Jiuyang sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a beam of light shot into the sky, illuminating everyone’s eyes. Before Jiuyang could see what the light was, it flashed past him, drew an elegant arc, and stopped in the sky.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>The tentacles that wrapped around Jiuyang snapped one after another. Jiuyang instantly regained his freedom. At the same time, the Sun God Light in his body spewed out again, causing his entire body to turn into light. He was like a humanoid sun.</p>
<p>Jiuyang looked at the figure in the air in pleasant surprise. Indeed, he saw Zhou Wen floating in the air in the Dragon King armor. He held the Bamboo Blade that emitted a cold aqueous glow. The tip of the blade was still dripping with blood.</p>
<p>He finally managed to do it. Xiao sensed the strange power that spread out from Zhou Wen’s body. The Essence Energy in his body stirred, but due to the suppression of the Treasurefall Money, he remained motionless.</p>
<p>“You actually recovered your Essence Energy… Unfortunately… Under the Treasurefall Money… Everything…” Before Toad Immortal could finish his sentence, his fish-like eyes suddenly narrowed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen reached out and plucked the Treasurefall Money from his forehead.</p>
<p>“Treasurefall Money? Are you talking about this?” Zhou Wen pinched the Treasurefall Money with his fingers and suddenly crushed it. The money fragments scattered down from his fingers like gravel. “How… How is this possible…” Toad Immortal’s eyes nearly popped out. He found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Even in the Mythical era, he had once been invincible using the Treasurefall Money. He had defeated countless terrifying bigwigs.</p>
<p>However, he had never imagined that the Treasurefall Money would be crushed by a human.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen crushed the Treasurefall Money, his figure flashed in front of Xiao. He pressed down on the Treasurefall Money on Xiao’s body and exerted some strength, shattering it to crumbling pieces.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1645'>Chapter 1645 Source of All Evil</h3>
<p>As the Treasurefall Money shattered, Xiao immediately returned to normal. When his body moved, it was as though he had an illusion that followed him. It was as though he was swimming between nothingness and reality. “Impossible!” Toad Immortal was still in disbelief as he used all his strength to activate his Money Domain.</p>
<p>However, under the influence of Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain, the effects of the Money Domain were completely eliminated. It couldn’t affect Zhou Wen and company in the Teacher Domain at all.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain to scan the Treasurefall Money, he completed the final piece of the puzzle. The trajectories in the Teacher Domain transformed into streams of light that fell into the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and condensed Source of All Evil.</p>
<p>With the birth of the Essence Energy Art, the Teacher Domain immediately had a restraining effect on the Money Domain. Wherever the Teacher Domain was, the Money Domain could no longer produce any effects.</p>
<p>Even Treasurefall Money was affected. Under the restraint of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen easily crushed it.</p>
<p>We are finally back at the starting line again. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. They finally had the capital to fight Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could take action, Xiao had already stood forward. His eyes narrowed as he stared at Toad Immortal in midair.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s heart skipped a beat. He was the very impressive and strong Toad Immortal, but all of this was built on the effectiveness of the Money Domain and the Treasurefall Money. Toad Immortal had relied on this unique skill to survive while wreaking havoc in the Queen Mother of the West’s dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Now that the Money Domain had lost its effects and the Treasurefall Money ability had been cracked by Zhou Wen, Toad Immortal immediately lost most of his confidence.</p>
<p>Despite both being at the Heaven level, he had seen Xiao’s combat strength. Without the Money Domain and Treasurefall Money, Toad Immortal knew that he was probably no match for Xiao, much less Jiuyang and Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal knew the principle of “where there’s life, there’s hope.” He turned around and wanted to escape. It wouldn’t be too late to think of a way to deal with Zhou Wen when he wasn’t with the others.</p>
<p>However, to Toad Immortal’s surprise, just as he turned around, he saw Xiao behind him. He was smiling at him, but the smile made Toad Immortal’s back turn cold. Cold sweat flowed down his forehead.</p>
<p>“F*ck you.” Toad Immortal suddenly exerted strength as the golden light on his golden robe trembled. He spat out a piece of Treasurefall Money that shot at Xiao.</p>
<p>However, in the Teacher Domain, no matter how his golden robe trembled, the Money Domain was useless. The Treasurefall Money wasn’t as terrifying as before. Although it could still be shot out, Xiao easily dodged it.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>Xiao appeared in front of Toad Immortal like a ghost. His palm struck back and forth, slapping Toad Immortal’s head left and right. His face was about to be smashed in, and the sound of bones cracking could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>IS</p>
<p>Toad Immortal waved his hands, hoping to fight Xiao to the death. However, when he pounced on Xiao, he only managed to hit an illusion. Another Xiao appeared behind him. His leg slashed at Toad Immortal’s waist like a blade, sending him flying. Zhou Wen only saw Xiao’s phantoms surrounding Toad Immortal and attacking him crazily. He couldn’t tell which was the illusion and which was the real deal. Both seemed capable of swapping between themselves at any time, causing Toad Immortal to cry out in pain from the lashing. He swayed back and forth like a roly-poly. Blood constantly splattered out with Xiao’s attacks as countless bones in his body were fractured.</p>
<p>“We agreed that everything on him will be mine.” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious when he saw this.</p>
<p>If this continued, Toad Immortal would definitely be killed by Xiao. When the time came, Zhou Wen might not be able to catch up to him if Xiao ran off with something.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Xiao’s final kick struck Toad Immortal’s head, smashing it right into his chest.</p>
<p>Toad Immortal’s body crashed into the planet like a comet, creating a huge ring-shaped crater. His mangled body no longer looked human.</p>
<p>“I’ll naturally keep my promise,” Xiao said indifferently without any intention of picking up the corpse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care as he rushed over to loot the corpse.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen wanted the most was Toad Immortal’s Calamity Essence. This was because Toad Immortal’s domain power was the power of taboo. This was similar to the Teacher Domain’s attributes. Perhaps Toad Immortal’s Calamity Essence could raise the Teacher Domain to the Hell level or even the Heaven level.</p>
<p>In that case, even without the augmentation of the Dragon King armor and eight Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen could fight a Heaven-level expert.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hoped that Toad Immortal’s body had the Calamity Essence, but before he could go over, Toad Immortal’s body moved.</p>
<p>“He’s still alive?” Zhou Wen and Xiao were taken aback.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at the injuries Toad Immortal suffered, he was doomed. He wasn’t a Calamity creature that was good at recovery. It was impossible for him to survive.</p>
<p>Just as the two of them were feeling puzzled, Toad Immortal’s body staggered as he stood up.</p>
<p>His actions were very strange, his body jerking like a zombie. In the next second, large amounts of white matter surged out of Toad Immortal’s body and instantly enveloped his body.</p>
<p>“That’s… the Companion Beast of this planet… It’s not dead yet…” Zhou Wen and company immediately knew what it was. Indeed, after the white matter devoured Toad Immortal’s body, it quickly distorted and shrank. Soon, it turned into the strange white jade-like Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It didn’t suffer any apparent injuries, much less be devoured and digested by Toad Immortal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the looks of it, its body had become even more majestic. It was clearly much taller and stronger than before. Its aura had also become stronger.</p>
<p>“Be careful. This Companion Beast is very good at devouring and imitating.” Xiao looked at the Companion Beast with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Previously, the Companion Beast could imitate his psyche mutation state and combat strength. Now that it had devoured Toad Immortal, Xiao was worried that it had even imitated Toad Immortal’s abilities.</p>
<p>The facts proved that Xiao’s worries weren’t unnecessary. The Companion Beast swept its gaze at everyone as its body suddenly emitted a powerful golden light. Ancient coins shot out from its body.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t!” Zhou Wen exclaimed in surprise as his eyes widened. Not only had the Companion Beast learned Toad Immortal’s abilities, but he had also made them stronger.</p>
<p>Previously, when Toad Immortal used the Money Domain, the money that formed the domain was only ordinary money. Only the ancient coin condensed in his mouth was Treasurefall Money.</p>
<p>However, the golden ancient coins that emitted from the Companion Beast’s body were all Treasurefall Money, forming a domain made of Treasurefall Money.</p>
<p>The power of the Teacher Domain could indeed restrain the Treasurefall Money, but it wasn’t as easy as restraining the Money Domain. Now that the entire domain was made of Treasurefall Money, the effects of the Teacher Domain on the Money Domain immediately weakened.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in the Teacher Domain, the Money Domain still couldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s body tore through the void and instantly appeared in front of Xiao.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1646'>Chapter 1646 Besieging</h3>
<p>The Companion Beast threw a punch at Xiao’s abdomen, but Xiao’s figure turned into an illusion, causing the punch to pass through his body and fail to injure him.</p>
<p>Xiao’s true body appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast and similarly threw a punch at its head.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast seemed to be unable to dodge in time and was struck in the head by Xiao’s punch. However, Xiao’s fist passed through its head, missing it-it was actually an illusion.</p>
<p>Xiao’s pupils suddenly constricted as he immediately turned his head. He saw an identical Companion Beast appear in another direction. The Companion Beast’s fist was already in front of his face.</p>
<p>In an exchange between reality and illusion, Xiao returned to the phantom from before. The body that had been struck in the face had turned into an illusion.</p>
<p>However, when Xiao returned, he realized that the Companion Beast he thought was an illusion had similarly struck his abdomen. A terrifying force entered his body through his abdomen, causing his muscles and bones to tremble. He suddenly flew out and barely stopped after traveling dozens of kilometers in the air.</p>
<p>Isn’t that Xiao’s ability? The Companion Beast actually learned it! Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were alarmed when they saw the Companion Beast’s phantom vanish from midair, leaving only its true body.</p>
<p>Xiao’s ability wasn’t only limited to the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple, but it was also supplemented by his own insights and mental mutations. Even a Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple couldn’t master such an ability.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast could actually imitate it and use such an ability to injure Xiao. It was obvious how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s figure flashed as it arrived in front of Zhou Wen. Its fist struck Zhou Wen’s abdomen at an indiscernible speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits as his figure gracefully drew an arc, dodging the Companion Beast’s repeated attacks.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s entire body was like a weapon as it dealt an onslaught of attacks at Zhou Wen. After a round of attacks, it failed to injure him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it opened its mouth and a white beam flashed. The white light was so fast that even Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t dodge it. His body was bound by a white object – the tongue of the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>This fellow actually learned Toad Immortal’s move! Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and slashed at the tongue that bound his body.</p>
<p>With the sharpness of the Bamboo Blade and Zhou Wen’s strength, this strike only left a shallow wound. It failed to sever the tongue.</p>
<p>Having dealt such a wound, it would probably require dozens of slashes to sever the tongue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have that much time. The tongue yanked him towards the Companion Beast and instantly made him arrive in front of it. He was about to be pulled into its open mouth.</p>
<p>Sun God Light tore through the sky like an aurora and struck the Companion Beast. The Companion Beast had no choice but to dodge the Sun God Light’s attack, preventing Zhou Wen from being pulled into its mouth.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xiao rushed over. While the Companion Beast dodged the Sun God Light, he appeared behind Zhou Wen like a ghost. His fingers were like blades as he repeatedly slashed at his tongue. The power that could slice through the void left deep marks on his tongue.</p>
<p>Feeling pain in its tongue, the Companion Beast released Zhou Wen and retracted the tongue back into its mouth.</p>
<p>“Jiuyang, come over. Attack together,” Xiao shouted at Jiuyang. Jiuyang had already rushed over. At the same time, the electromagnetic monster that was chasing after him rushed over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood what Xiao was up to. The three of them were to attack the Companion Beast together. Although the electromagnetic monster was an enemy, the enemies combined might not necessarily become stronger enemies.</p>
<p>However, the three of them together would become stronger. Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal. He was as agile and elegant as a true immortal in the sky. As he besieged the Companion Beast, he used the electromagnetic monster to restrain the Companion Beast’s attacks.</p>
<p>Although the electromagnetic monster was also at the Heaven level, its intelligence was ordinary to begin with. Furthermore, after being controlled by the Companion Beast’s power, it only had the instinct to fight.</p>
<p>Its arrival provided cover for Zhou Wen and company. From time to time, they would position themselves to exploit the electromagnetic monster for blocking the Companion Beast’s attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade drew out arcs as it slashed at the Companion Beast from different directions.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s Sun God Light struck the Companion Beast from different directions again and again. Xiao’s phantoms surrounded the Companion Beast from every direction. Although this was the first time the three of them were working together, they seemed to be telepathically connected. Their teamwork was flawless.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>After all, it was difficult for the Companion Beast to fight six hands with two fists. In a moment of carelessness, Jiuyang struck its back with the Sun God Fist. Its white jade-like muscles were charred black by the Sun God Light.</p>
<p>While the Companion Beast was staggering, Zhou Wen’s saber and Xiao’s fingers constantly slashed at it. Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade left saber marks on the Companion Beast’s body.</p>
<p>Xiao’s fingers constantly ripped through the Companion Beast’s body as Jiuyang’s fists struck out repeatedly. The three of them unleashed their strongest strength as they attacked the Companion Beast’s body from three different directions.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast staggered from the beating as the wounds on its body increased significantly. At that moment, the electromagnetic monster charged forward and swept its tentacles at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to divert his attention to slash at the electromagnetic monster’s tentacles. Flashing the saber beam a few times, he snapped one of the tentacles.</p>
<p>When he turned his head to look at the Companion Beast, he realized that Jiuyang’s Sun God Light and Xiao’s finger forces had penetrated its body, but the Companion Beast’s body was gradually dissipating like a phantom. The three of them looked around and quickly realized that high in the sky, the Companion Beast stood atop the clouds. The wounds on its body were healing at an unbelievable speed. “We can’t give it time to heal.” Xiao took a step forward and arrived in front of the Companion Beast. Although the Companion Beast had learned his abilities, Xiao didn’t admit that he would lose to the same ability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he knew this ability very well. He also knew what weaknesses it had.</p>
<p>Xiao moved his fingers and produced space-rupturing powers that slashed at the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Xiao, Zhou Wen, and Jiuyang widened their eyes. They saw the Companion Beast’s figure move like an immortal as it drew an elegant arc and dodged Xiao’s space-rupturing powers.</p>
<p>It was Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique. Not only was it Transcendent Flying Immortal, but even the concept was identical.</p>
<p>What’s going on with this Companion Beast? Zhou Wen and company couldn’t help but feel a chill. The strength of this Companion Beast far exceeded their imagination.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1647'>Chapter 1647 Two Companion Beasts</h3>
<p>However, there was no way out. Zhou Wen and Jiuyang charged forward without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s Sun God Light penetrated everything and illuminated everything. It was a force that was virtually impossible to hide from.</p>
<p>However, under the Sun God Light, the Companion Beast’s body turned into an illusion. Its true body strangely appeared behind Jiuyang as its fingertip slashed at Jiuyang’s neck like a blade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen flew like an immortal as he slashed down with his Bamboo Blade. Xiao’s figure strangely appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast as he stabbed the Companion Beast’s eyes with two fingers. The Companion Beast’s fingertip that swiped at Jiuyang remained unchanged. The other monkey claw-like palm flicked the Bamboo Blade, causing it to change direction and slash at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao and Zhou Wen quickly diverted their strength, barely avoiding the situation of them killing each other. However, the Companion Beast’s fingers had already swiped at Jiuyang’s neck. At the same time, its hooves kicked out like lightning. With a sun-like glow, it kicked Zhou Wen and Xiao, sending them flying.</p>
<p>The armor on Zhou Wen and Xiao’s chests were destroyed. The terrifying light charred their flesh until it turned to ash.</p>
<p>Jiuyang had already tried his best to move forward, but a bone-deep wound remained on his neck. Blood was gushing out. Instantly, all three of them were injured.</p>
<p>This fellow is a freak! Zhou Wen forcefully suppressed the wound on his chest. When he saw the Companion Beast approaching him, he hurriedly dodged in the direction of the electromagnetic monster and used it to block the Companion Beast’s attack.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen circled behind the electromagnetic monster, he saw a white light flash from the Companion Beast’s mouth. Its tongue wrapped around the electromagnetic monster and pulled its huge body towards its open mouth.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic monster’s body was extremely huge, but when it was pulled to the Companion Beast’s mouth, it strangely shrank and was swallowed.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast didn’t rush over for the time being. Jiuyang stopped the wound on the back of his neck and swallowed his saliva. “This fellow might not be as simple as a Calamity-grade creature.”</p>
<p>“No matter what it was in the past, we have to kill it now. Otherwise, we will be the ones dying.” Xiao’s expression was solemn.</p>
<p>“Do you know the origins of this Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>It was definitely not a coincidence that Xiao and Jiuyang were here. They must know something to be able to find such an inconspicuous place in the universe among millions of stars.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao exchanged looks as Xiao said, “There’s no need to hide anything now. This Companion Beast’s origins are somewhat special…”</p>
<p>Xiao recounted the origins of the Companion Beast, but he didn’t mention that it had something on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he heard that.</p>
<p>“You mean that this planet actually has two Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen stared at Xiao and asked.</p>
<p>“In theory, there should be two, but the other one should have been sucked dry by the parasitic Companion Beast. The chances of survival are very low,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case!” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think of the bee in the plant.</p>
<p>He had always believed that the bee was the Companion Beast on this planet because it had all sorts of Companion Beast characteristics.</p>
<p>However, after this Companion Beast appeared, Zhou Wen overturned his previous speculation, believing that the bee might be a native creature that was similar to a Companion Beast produced by this planet.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Xiao’s words, Zhou Wen suspected that although this planet had been parasitized by the Companion Beast, the original Companion Beast hadn’t died. It was very likely that both Companion Beasts had survived.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t know which was the original Companion Beast on this planet and which was the parasite.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast didn’t give Zhou Wen any time to consider. After floating in the air for a moment, it launched another attack and charged over like a phantom.</p>
<p>One after another, the phantoms used Transcendent Flying Immortal’s movement techniques to charge at Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>It was originally three people attacking a Companion Beast, but now, it was as though the three of them were being attacked by the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The phantoms were Xiao’s techniques, but at that moment, when used by the Companion Beast, they seemed to be even more powerful than Xiao’s. Not only could he not tell which were the phantoms, but every phantom seemed to have offensive strength.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company didn’t last long before they suffered varying degrees of injuries. If this continued, it was only a matter of time before they were beaten to death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to use Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens. Although this domain was useless to him, Xiao and Jiuyang’s injuries rapidly healed inside the domain.</p>
<p>This crappy domain clearly has such potent healing abilities, so why can’t it heal me! Zhou Wen was extremely vexed.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang’s injuries quickly healed. They were originally very happy, but when they saw Zhou Wen’s situation, their expressions changed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s strength had clearly healed them, but his injuries didn’t heal quickly. This was just too strange.</p>
<p>“You are really a classic example of sacrificing yourself for others,” Xiao said loudly as he fought. He had already guessed what was going on.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s what I want? I can treat anyone in this crappy domain of mine but myself,” Zhou Wen said gloomily. He had already used Transcendent Flying Immortal with all his might, but the concepts of the Transcendent Flying Immortal movement techniques of the phantoms weren’t inferior to his. They were faster than him, making him suffer more and more injuries as he fought.</p>
<p>Although Jiuyang and Xiao’s situation was much better thanks to Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens, they were also unable to fend for themselves. They didn’t have the strength to help Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>They also knew very well that a large part of the reason they could survive this long was because of Zhou Wen’s double domains. One domain helped them block the Money Domain’s seal, while the other helped them rapidly recover. Without these two domains to save their lives, it was impossible for them to last until now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that he couldn’t last much longer. He kept thinking about how he could escape his present predicament.</p>
<p>With his Teacher Domain and interstellar teleportation abilities, he might be able to escape.</p>
<p>However, if he escaped just like that, Tsukuyomi would definitely die under the glacier.</p>
<p>With the acumen of this Companion Beast, it was impossible for it not to discover Tsukuyomi’s existence. I can only take a gamble now! Zhou Wen thought of the bee in the ice pool.</p>
<p>If it was really the other Companion Beast on the planet, be it the original Companion Beast or the parasitic Companion Beast, in theory, the two were enemies.</p>
<p>After all, the parasite had snatched the nutrients of the original Companion Beast. It was impossible for the two to have a friendly relationship.</p>
<p>“Follow me.” Zhou Wen roared as he called out to Xiao and Jiuyang and charged down the glacier.</p>
<p>Although Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, they had no strength to fight once they left Zhou Wen’s domain. All they could do was rush over and burrow into the glacier with him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1648'>Chapter 1648 Mythical Object</h3>
<p>The Companion Beast chased after them as Zhou Wen and company fled beneath the glacier. Thankfully, with the glacier as cover, the Companion Beast’s attacks were somewhat obstructed. “Zhou Wen, don’t tell me you want to use the terrain to stall for time?” Jiuyang released the Sun God Light from his body as though a volcano had erupted, sending the pursuing phantoms retreating.</p>
<p>“No, there’s another Companion Beast down there. Perhaps that thing can save our lives.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had already rushed to the side of the pool.</p>
<p>“There’s another Companion Beast?” Jiuyang and Xiao were first taken aback before they immediately reacted.</p>
<p>Could it be that the parasitized Companion Beast isn’t dead? After Jiuyang’s first thought, he immediately thought of another possibility and continued, “Which one is the parasitized Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said as he plunged into the pool.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao charged down as well. The Companion Beast pursuing them struck the pool with terrifying power, blasting a hole through the pool and the nearby glaciers, forming a huge crater.</p>
<p>The pool wasn’t deep to begin with, so when it blasted through, it revealed the strange plant. Zhou Wen and company suffered immense pressure in the water as they were slammed into the glacier beside them.</p>
<p>The surrounding glaciers shattered. Only the glacier where the strange plant was remained intact. Neither the bee in the fruit nor the plant were affected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company got up from the ice crater and prepared to fight, but they realized that the Companion Beast was floating in the air. It didn’t continue attacking. Instead, it stared at the bee in the strange plant.</p>
<p>“They are indeed related,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>“I never expected the Companion Beast that was parasitized to still be alive. However, I wonder which of the two of them is the Companion Beast born from the planet itself.” Xiao looked at the bee and then at the Companion Beast in the sky. A strange glint flashed in his eyes as though he had discovered something</p>
<p>In fact, Jiuyang had also discovered Xiao’s discovery.</p>
<p>The bee held a trumpet in its claws. No matter how one looked at it, it didn’t look like something a bee should have. It was likely an external object.</p>
<p>According to Holy God, the escaping Companion Beast had accidentally taken something away before parasitizing the planet.</p>
<p>Although Holy God didn’t say what that thing was, from the looks of it, it was very likely this tiny trumpet.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only their guess. It might not be accurate. The Companion Beast that chased after them seemed to be afraid of the bee. It floated in the air without coming down. It kept staring at the bee, its gaze focused on the tiny trumpet. It didn’t move, nor did Zhou Wen. Jiuyang and Xiao didn’t dare move either, hoping to wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hoped to stall for time until Tsukuyomi finished her absorption. When that happened, he wouldn’t have any qualms about fighting or escaping, unlike how bound he was.</p>
<p>“Are you hiding something from me?” Zhou Wen’s observational abilities were extremely sharp, so how could he not notice that the Companion Beast was constantly looking at the trumpet?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jiuyang and Xiao were also looking at the trumpet. This made Zhou Wen even more certain that they knew something.</p>
<p>Jiuyang pondered for a moment and said, “At this point, there’s no need to hide it from you. According to what we know, when the Companion Beast passed through the Mythical battlefield, it accidentally brought something into the planet. As the planet is protected by the rules of the universe, even Heaven-level creatures can’t forcefully open the planet unless the Companion Beast inside it is about to appear. Therefore, no one can retrieve it.” “What did the Companion Beast bring in? Zhou Wen was very curious.”</p>
<p>He roughly knew that there had been a Mythical era on Earth. In that era, countless powerful lifeforms had fought on Earth or even in the universe.</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>However, for some reason, these powerful existences either vanished or sealed themselves.</p>
<p>According to the various information Zhou Wen already knew, the dimensional zones in the Mythical era on Earth were very likely to have opened. Later on, for some reason, they were sealed again. Only when the dimensional storms of recent times descended did the sealed dimensional zones open again.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had always been curious about what had happened during the Mythical era.</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>Of course, this was only his speculation. Only lifeforms who had experienced that era knew if this was the case.</p>
<p>However, even an existence like Grim Demon who had experienced that era couldn’t figure out how the final Mythical battle ended.</p>
<p>Perhaps only an existence like The Thearch will truly know what happened in the Mythical era. Zhou Wen had always felt that The Thearch definitely knew many things. Zhou Wen still found The Thearch unfathomable like a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>In the past, when Zhou Wen was young, he felt that The Thearch was very strong. Now, he could fight Calamity-grade creatures, but that didn’t change his former views.</p>
<p>In fact, the stronger he was, the more he found The Thearch’s strength unbelievable.</p>
<p>The power of wish was heaven-defying. Even a Heaven-level domain was inferior to it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Jiuyang shook his head and said, “The information we obtained was only that the Companion Beast brought in something very important, but we don’t know what it is. Now, we are very suspicious that it’s the trumpet in the bee’s claw.” “If it’s really the trumpet, doesn’t that mean that the bee is the Companion Beast parasite? The fellow we fought is a native of this planet?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“If the trumpet is really that thing, that guess is very likely.” Xiao had been observing the Companion Beast in the air. Halfway through his sentence, he suddenly changed the topic. “Be careful. That fellow can’t hold back.”</p>
<p>Indeed, just as Xiao said that, the Companion Beast rushed down. Its target was obvious. It wasn’t any of Zhou Wen and company, but the bee in the fruit.</p>
<p>When the Companion Beast took one step, the light on its foot was as dazzling as the sun. It was Jiuyang’s Sun God Light that it mimicked.</p>
<p>Although the Sun God Light wasn’t scorching hot enough when used by it, its destructive power was even more terrifying than when Jiuyang used it.</p>
<p>The bee in the fruit was still lying there as though it hadn’t woken up. The bee remained motionless even when the Companion Beast’s sun-like feet stepped on the fruit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A powerful force struck the fruit, triggering a terrifying explosion. Even with Zhou Wen and company’s strength, they couldn’t help but retreat from the shockwave produced by the explosion.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1649'>Chapter 1649 The Trumpet Sounds</h3>
<p>After the explosion, Zhou Wen and company looked at the plant and bee.</p>
<p>However, the spot where the plant was had already become a huge crater. The plant that grew in the glacier had long vanished. Not a single leaf or vine was left behind.</p>
<p>Where did the bee go? Don’t tell me it died just like that? Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings, hoping to find the bee’s remains. He didn’t believe that the bee had died just like that.</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhou Wen quickly discovered traces of the tiny bee. It wasn’t dead. It was floating in the air and looked extremely lucid. The wings on its back moved so quickly that they appeared almost invisible.</p>
<p>In its front claws, it still held the trumpet-like item as it stared at the Companion Beast that had retreated into the air.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast also stared at the bee as though it had some qualms. It didn’t attack again.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the Companion Beast seemed to make up its mind as it attacked the bee again. It used Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Arcs of Essence Energy slashed at the bee from all directions. It was like an inescapable net that prevented it from dodging.</p>
<p>As the creator of Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen naturally knew how terrifying such an attack was. Unless the bee’s speed far exceeded the Companion Beast’s, it could only await death. Just as Zhou Wen thought that the bee was about to suffer, he saw it finally wake up. It placed the trumpet in its mouth, puffed up its cheeks, and blew hard.</p>
<p>A high and sharp sound blared from the trumpet. Zhou Wen felt that it sounded like a suona.</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t be said that it was similar. It was exactly a suona. The high pitch voice was something that no other musical instrument could simulate. It was music that penetrated straight to the soul.</p>
<p>Pfft! Under the protection of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but vomit a mouthful of blood when he heard the suona’s sound.</p>
<p>Jiuyang and Xiao’s situation was even worse. Although they were also within the Teacher Domain’s range and were protected by it, the Teacher Domain wasn’t their own strength after all. The injuries they suffered were worse than Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang fell from the sky and into the glacier ruins. It was unknown if they were dead or alive.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast also spat out blood as it fell from the sky, plummeting towards the ravaged planet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Zhou Wen and company. Even the black and white wolves and the strange fish, who were fighting inside the planet, fell to the ground when they heard the suona. It was unknown if they were dead or alive as well.</p>
<p>Anything alive on the planet fell when they heard the suona, their survivability a question.</p>
<p>The bee’s wings trembled. Its claws still held the trumpet, but it didn’t blow it again. The sound swept across the planet as though it was searching for a living creature.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the bee’s gaze sweep towards him, he immediately pretended to be dead in the ruins of the glacier and rocks. He converged all his vitality and aura, hoping to fool the bee.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? It seems even more terrifying than the Companion Beast that was pursuing us. Are all the Companion Beasts on this planet that terrifying? I wonder how Tsukuyomi is doing. Will this lethal suona sound affect Tsukuyomi and kill her? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more likely it was.</p>
<p>Even Heaven-level Companion Beasts and experts like Xiao couldn’t withstand the suona’s sound and fell onto the planet. It was still a question if they were dead or alive. If Tsukuyomi, who was in a state that didn’t allow disturbances, heard this sound, the chances of her dying were very high.</p>
<p>Even if she didn’t die, the possibility of her going berserk was very high.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t have the chance to save Tsukuyomi even if he wanted to. The suona’s sound instantly covered the entire planet, preventing him from saving her.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Jiuyang and Xiao were dead or alive. In any case, there was no sound after they landed. It was highly likely that the situation wasn’t good.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen pretended to be dead, he used Truth Listener’s powers to scan the Companion Beast’s location. He saw it struggling to stand up. Although the suona had dealt him quite significant damage, it hadn’t killed him.</p>
<p>As the Companion Beast struggled to its feet, its injuries rapidly healed. When it floated in the air, it had already returned to its uninjured state. It looked like it had never been injured.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast stared at the bee as the coldness in its eyes intensified. Its aura also became stronger.</p>
<p>A dog-eat-dog fight. Zhou Wen had no intention of getting up to participate in the battle. All he wanted to do was watch from the side as the two terrifying Companion Beasts fought.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to know who would win. What he was most worried about was if anything happened to Tsukuyomi. When the Companion Beast moved and attacked the bee, Zhou Wen silently sneaked towards Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that the ice cavern had already collapsed and shattered into ice. Although he didn’t find Tsukuyomi’s corpse, she was probably doomed.</p>
<p>After all, Tsukuyomi couldn’t move while absorbing the power of the Moon Essence Basin. It was impossible for her to withstand such a force.</p>
<p>I’ve already tried my best. You can’t blame me even if you died. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly. He had worked so hard for so long, but he ultimately couldn’t save Tsukuyomi’s life.</p>
<p>With Tsukuyomi doomed, Zhou Wen no longer had any reason to continue fighting. He was already considering how to escape.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately escape. He pretended to be dead in the glacier ruins, hoping to wait until the outcome of the two terrifying Companion Beasts was decided.</p>
<p>The two Companion Beasts were extremely terrifying existences. One seemed to be able to transform all the powers in the world for its own use as though it was a monster that couldn’t be killed. As for the bee, it only blew the tiny trumpet, and even Heaven-level creatures couldn’t withstand it. How impressive was that?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was basically certain that the bee was the parasitic Companion Beast. The suona-like item was very likely something that had been lost in the battlefield of the gods.</p>
<p>What’s that tiny trumpet? It only needs a mere blow to be so powerful. If the bee were to use it to play a tune, what would happen? Zhou Wen thought of the music produced by the bubbles.</p>
<p>Back then, just music without any power could make humans and dimensional creatures commit suicide. If the tune was played by a trumpet, Zhou Wen really had no idea what the outcome would be.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1650'>Chapter 1650 Both Pets Fighting</h3>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he saw the Companion Beast charge at the bee again. It had fused Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique together, making it unbelievably fast. Wherever it passed, it left behind afterimages in the void.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the Companion Beast arrived in front of the bee again and threw a punch at it.</p>
<p>Halfway through, its fist split into dozens. Like split tentacles, they struck the bee from different directions.</p>
<p>Every split fist carried extremely potent Sun God Light. It was as though dozens of cold suns were striking the bee from different directions.</p>
<p>This fellow is a freak. It even learned the electromagnetic monster’s ability. Zhou Wen didn’t know the limits of the Companion Beast. In any case, it appeared capable of learning any ability.</p>
<p>mo</p>
<p>It would be even more terrifying if it mastered the bee’s trumpet blowing ability. Beep!</p>
<p>The suona suddenly sounded in an earth-shattering manner. The fists were about to hit the bee, but the Companion Beast’s body seemed to suffer a heavy blow as it flew out with a bang.</p>
<p>The dozens of fists that split apart constantly exploded. Likewise, the body kept exploding as if it were filled with explosives</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already very far from the battlefield, but the sound of the suona immediately stirred the Essence Energy in his body like a nuclear reactor that was close to meltdown.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen was relatively far from the battlefield. Furthermore, the Teacher Domain had played a role. He forcefully suppressed the violent Essence Energy in his body. Otherwise, he might have exploded like the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>What’s that trumpet? It’s too terrifying! Zhou Wen stared at the suona the bee had placed by its mouth in envy.</p>
<p>Even the Companion Beast that was almost invincible at the Calamity grade was blown up by it. The might of the suona was terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it made sense when he thought about it. During the battle of the gods, there were countless terrifying experts who fought their way into the cosmos. The creatures who could participate in such battles were definitely the cream of the crop in that mythical era.</p>
<p>The things they brought with them were naturally extraordinary. Furthermore, despite having gone missing for so many years, Holy God was still eyeing it. It was obvious how precious it was.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen failed to figure out what powerful divine artifact was a suona in myths.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly heard an explosion nearby. He saw the white and black Horned Wolves rush out of the underground cave. Just as they left the cave, their bodies exploded, turning into a bloody mist that filled the sky.</p>
<p>When they were in the planet’s interior, the sonar attacks they suffered were weaker. They could barely rely on the barrier they combined to survive.</p>
<p>However, they wanted to escape. After leaving the underground cave, they were attacked by the sound. Their bodies couldn’t withstand it and immediately exploded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s sharp eyes noticed that two crystal-like Companion Eggs dropped from the black and white wolves’ blood mist. His eyes immediately lit up.</p>
<p>The suona had already reached its final note. The sound waves produced weakened as Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to instant transmit over. He grabbed the two Companion Eggs-one in each hand-and instant transmitted back.</p>
<p>He didn’t wish to leave just like that. Even if Tsukuyomi had already encountered misfortune, he had to see her corpse to leave in peace.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen went to snatch the Companion Egg, he saw the strange fish rush out of the underground cave. It charged at the bee fearlessly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jiuyang and Xiao crawled out. They were bleeding from their seven orifices. The situation didn’t look good.</p>
<p>“Retreat!” Xiao shouted softly as he attempted to use the Trajectory technique to escape into the void.</p>
<p>Neither of these two Companion Beasts were to be trifled with. Even if he joined forces with Zhou Wen and Jiuyang, they wouldn’t be able to gain any advantage. They might even lose their lives.</p>
<p>Jiuyang also planned on rushing out of the atmosphere. Space greatly restricted sound transmission.</p>
<p>The bee clearly wasn’t interested in them as it kept staring at the exploding Companion Beast. Just as the Companion Beast’s body was about to be blasted apart, the blasted body quickly reformed and the wounds vanished. This was the electromagnetic monster’s ability. However, the effects were even more ridiculous when used by the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The strange fish had already arrived above the bee. Its tail transformed into a cloth that blotted out the sky as it swept down to envelop the bee.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that the bee was about to blow its suona again as he retreated at high speeds, hoping to get further away.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the bee didn’t blow the suona. A cold glimmer flashed around its tail as Zhou Wen saw the cold beam pierce through the strange fish’s tail and penetrate its body. After being controlled by the Companion Beast, the strange fish’s white jade-like body instantly turned black. Then, it collapsed and turned into dust.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s vision was in no way inferior to a Calamity-grade expert. Furthermore, with Truth Listener’s help, he could clearly see the strange fish’s body disintegrate into extremely tiny black particles. After the black particles scattered, they disintegrated again, preventing Zhou Wen from seeing them. This thing… Don’t tell me it’s a poison-type… Zhou Wen thought of his Doctor Darkness Companion Beast. Doctor Darkness relied on absorbing poison to evolve. He had recently advanced to the Terror grade, but he hadn’t found any stronger poison to advance him to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>If this bee was really a poison-type creature, it meant that the toxin it had used was extremely terrifying. It was unknown what would happen if Doctor Darkness were to absorb it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was a poison-type power. Even if it was, he didn’t know if the Terror-grade Doctor Darkness could withstand such a terrifying poison.</p>
<p>After all, even a Heaven-level creature was poisoned to death from a single stab. The Terror-grade Doctor Darkness might disintegrate before advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>“It’s no good. This planet seems to be locked onto by some force. We can’t leave.” Xiao and Jiuyang’s expressions were abnormally ugly. They had attempted to escape, but they couldn’t.</p>
<p>The entire planet seemed to be sealed by some strange force. Even Xiao’s void trajectory power didn’t allow for escape.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Companion Beast that had already healed pounced at the bee again. Clearly, it wanted to snatch the suona controlled by the bee.</p>
<p>The bee seemed to know that its poison needle was useless against the Companion Beast. It might even be absorbed and learned by the Companion Beast. Therefore, it didn’t use the method used against the strange fish to deal with it. Instead, it played the suona again.</p>
<p>This time, the sound was somewhat different from before. Although it was equally loud, it also made one feel a sense of sorrow that resembled sobbing.</p>
<p>This tune… Zhou Wen knew that it was the bubble music he had heard many times by the pool.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1651'>Chapter 1651 Gushing Tears</h3>
<p>The suona sounded as the Companion Beast that was charging at the bee suddenly seemed to be shackled. Its movements became abnormally slow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there seemed to be a downward force that gradually pulled the Companion Beast to the ground.</p>
<p>As the bee played the suona, it easily dodged the Companion Beast’s attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were already very far from the battlefield, but the sound of the suona made their knees sink. Their bodies leaned forward as they had the urge to kneel. “What’s wrong with your faces…” Jiuyang suddenly shouted. Zhou Wen and Xiao didn’t feel anything amiss, but when they looked at each other, they realized that tears had subconsciously fallen from the corner of their eyes and were flowing down their cheeks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wiped the tears from his face, but there were still tears seeping out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>rners</p>
<p>“You too,” Xiao glanced at Jiuyang and said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Jiuyang reached out to wipe his tears. Indeed, he realized that tears had already appeared on his face at some point in time. He couldn’t help but reveal a look of horror.</p>
<p>“It’s the power of that music.” Zhou Wen circulated the Teacher Domain with all his might, hoping to screen the sound coming from the distance, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>The suona’s sound seemed to ring in his head, causing more and more tears to flow. Jiuyang and Xiao were in an even worse state. They were already covered in tears. What was even more terrifying was that they felt their knees sink deeper and deeper. Their bodies were on the brink of collapse, as though they would kneel at any moment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Companion Beast on the battlefield fell onto the planet. Its knees were bent as its strength constantly erupted as though it was resisting some invisible force.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast’s face was the same as Zhou Wen and company’s. It was already covered in tears. Its huge eyes were constantly brimming with tears as though it was experiencing extreme sorrow.</p>
<p>“Damn it, we mustn’t kneel or we might die.” Seeing the Companion Beast struggling with all its might not to kneel, Xiao had a bad feeling. He tried his best to stop his knees from bending, but to no avail. His legs couldn’t help but slowly bend.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were the same. As they cried, they tried their best to prop their bodies up, preventing themselves from kneeling. Their efforts were less than ideal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried a few methods, but none of them worked. When he saw that the Companion Beast couldn’t escape the magical power of the music, he knew that ordinary powers were useless.</p>
<p>If even the top Calamity Companion Beast couldn’t withstand the sound, it was even harder for them to withstand it.</p>
<p>Seeing his knees approaching the ground, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and summoned the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites. Then, he used the Golden Harp to control them and made them play the bubble music he had heard by the pool.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was of any use. He just treated it as a last-ditch effort. Perhaps the outcome of doing so would accelerate their kneeling, but at this point, there was no other way. All he could do was give it a try.</p>
<p>After summoning the Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp, they were surprisingly unaffected by the magical sound, giving Zhou Wen some hope.</p>
<p>Under the control of the Golden Harp, the Musical Note Sprites began playing the bubble music.</p>
<p>It was strange. It was clearly the same music, but the effects of the Musical Note Sprites’ playing were different from the suona.</p>
<p>The sound waves produced by the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites combined with the suona’s music immediately made Zhou Wen and company’s tears gush out. Their knees suddenly sank, just shy of a foot from the ground.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, Zhou Wen, what the f*ck are you doing?” Jiuyang couldn’t help but curse in fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got the Musical Note Sprites to stop playing. He had expected this possibility, but he never expected it to be the worst situation.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, get your Musical Note Sprites to continue playing that music,” Xiao suddenly said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he immediately thought of something. Xiao also said, “Don’t let their rhythm be the same as the suona. Play it out-of-sync.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already begun doing it. Although he didn’t know if it would be effective or make them kneel faster, the outcome was the same if he didn’t do anything —they would only kneel at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Amidst the Golden Harp’s music, a portion of the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites produced rhythmic music. The tune was the same as the suona’s tune, but the beat was out-of-sync.</p>
<p>The Musical Note Sprites that filled the sky surrounded Zhou Wen and company as they danced like countless butterflies. The sound waves constantly echoed around them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were so nervous that their foreheads were covered in sweat. Their tears were still flowing, and Zhou Wen was prepared to order the Musical Note Sprites to stop playing at any moment.</p>
<p>However, after the music sounded, their knees didn’t suddenly sink. Instead, they sank at a much slower speed; their tears also flowed less.</p>
<p>It’s effective! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly ordered all the Musical Note Sprites to perform together.</p>
<p>The sound waves constantly echoed. As the beat was out-of-sync, it produced a very discordant feeling with the suona’s music. Although Zhou Wen and company could still hear the suona’s music and their tears were still flowing, the speed at which the tears flowed had slowed down significantly. The force that made their knees sink had weakened significantly, allowing them to barely withstand the pressure and not continue sinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in a dilemma. The bubble music combined with the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites was indeed effective. If he used this power to help the Companion Beast, he might be able to free it from the restrictions of the music. It might even give it the strength to fight.</p>
<p>The problem was that the two Companion Beasts weren’t anything good. One wanted their lives while blowing the trumpet, while the other wanted their lives even without the trumpet being played.</p>
<p>No matter which Zhou Wen helped, the final outcome might not be a good thing.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen controlled the Golden Harp and tried his best to control the sound waves near them, preventing the Musical Note Sprites’ powers from affecting the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast would definitely kill them. The bee had only shown animosity towards the Companion Beast and hadn’t targeted them. Zhou Wen decided to place his bet on the bee.</p>
<p>Making such a decision was actually equally risky.</p>
<p>This was because the bee had the treasure-like suona. It was highly likely that it was the parasitic Companion Beast. It could parasitize others and appropriate their nutrients or even their lives. It was impossible for it to be a docile Companion Beast. After it killed another Companion Beast, it was very likely to kill Zhou Wen and company. However, at this point in time, there had to be a choice. The rest was up to fate.</p>
<p>Under the magical sound of the suona, the Companion Beast’s knees approached the ground. Even someone as powerful as it couldn’t withstand the god-like music.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>One of the Companion Beast’s knees knelt on the ground, producing fractures in the ground that spanned several kilometers.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1652'>Chapter 1652 Dead</h3>
<p>The Companion Beast continued persisting as it shot out Treasurefall Money repeatedly, but it couldn’t eliminate the power it was affected</p>
<p>by.</p>
<p>The Treasurefall Money that flew out was easily dodged by the suona-blowing bee.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>With another loud bang, the Companion Beast’s other leg knelt on the ground. Its hands pressed down on the shattered ground as it bared its teeth and struggled with all its might, but it was unable to get up no matter what.</p>
<p>Its eyes were already distorted as tears poured down.</p>
<p>A strange scene also happened-black flames began to rise from the Companion Beast’s white jade-like body.</p>
<p>Every inch of its body seemed to emit a transparent black gas. The black gas was indiscernible as though it was a death aura that came from the Netherworld. It emitted an ominous aura.</p>
<p>As the black gas rose, the extremely powerful Companion Beast’s vitality rapidly drained. Even its Essence Energy rapidly weakened. The body that looked like it was carved from white jade was also aging and shriveling. In just a moment, the Companion Beast’s body looked like it was about to turn from a youth to an old man. Its jade-like body was covered in wrinkles. The original white color gradually turned yellow, like the color of old newspapers that had been through the ravages of time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were alarmed when they saw this. They were secretly glad that they hadn’t knelt down. Otherwise, they would already be dead.</p>
<p>However, even if the Musical Note Sprites could temporarily resist the bee’s suona, Zhou Wen and company still couldn’t escape. Once the Companion Beast died, it would probably be their turn.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had already decided to place a bet on the bee, he wasn’t confident when he saw the situation. He even had the intention of helping the Companion Beast stall for time by keeping it in check.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen ultimately gave up on this idea. The army of Musical Note Sprites wasn’t really able to resist the suona. Even if he was willing to help the Companion Beast, he might not be able to provide much help. Instead, he might anger the bee.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bee hadn’t wanted their lives at first, but by giving a hand, he might end up making things worse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen had other plans. If the bee really wanted them dead, Zhou Wen would definitely end up kneeling.</p>
<p>His Life Providence was unlikely to sit idle. After all, this wasn’t him kneeling, but being forced to kneel. With Sigh of the King’s temper, how could it tolerate such a thing?</p>
<p>As for whether the Sigh of the King could withstand the suona’s music, that wasn’t something Zhou Wen knew. When the time came, he could only leave it to fate.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, we are most likely going to die here today.” Jiuyang glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “I don’t have any pursuits or wishes in my life. My only regret is not being able to personally defeat you.” “Why are you still thinking about that at a time like this? It’s best if you think about how to stay alive.” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. What kind of person was he? At this point in time, he was still thinking about such matters.</p>
<p>“It’s precisely because it’s difficult to tell if we’ll live. We might die immediately. If I don’t make things clear now, I won’t die happy,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, Who cares if you’re happy when you’re dead? I’ve never heard of anyone who would be happy dying. “Xiao, do you have any ideas?” Zhou Wen ignored Jiuyang and turned to look at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao frowned and pondered for a moment before saying with a serious expression, “Just say whatever you want to say. It might be a form of release.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rendered even more speechless, but on second thought, he asked Jiuyang and Xiao, “Since we’re about to die, can you tell me if Ouyang Ting, who you captured, is still alive? Why did you capture him?” Zhou Wen’s gaze was mainly trained on Jiuyang. He felt that this fellow was rather reliable. At this moment, he might even tell the truth. As for Xiao, Zhou Wen didn’t dare believe his words even at the moment of death.</p>
<p>“Alive. Don’t ask me anything else. I don’t know,” Jiuyang said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted when he saw that Jiuyang didn’t seem to be lying. As long as he was still alive, there was still a chance of rescuing him in the future. Furthermore, from Jiuyang’s words, Xiao seemed to know more. Therefore, he cast his gaze at Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao said expressionlessly, “Even if I die, I’ll take matters related to the Holy Land to the grave. Furthermore, we might not die.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a solution?” Jiuyang and Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. As long as that bee doesn’t want us dead, we naturally won’t have to die,” Xiao said indifferently.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to tell me that. I know it too.” Zhou Wen was somewhat exasperated. All he could do was ask Jiuyang, “Jiuyang, where do you Saints come from? Why are you so loyal to the Holy Land? Have you never thought that the Holy Land is enslaving your kind?”</p>
<p>Jiuyang shook his head and said, “The so-called same kind are just unfamiliar lifeforms. What’s the difference between them and other unknown creatures? What has their lives got to do with us?”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t agree with Jiuyang’s theory, from Jiuyang’s point of view, what he said made sense.</p>
<p>Saints had been nurtured by the Holy Land since they were young. Their living environment was different from ordinary humans, so it was normal for them to not identify with humanity.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask something, he suddenly heard a long roar. He saw the Companion Beast roaring at the sky. As for its body, it had already reached its limits. What flowed out of its eyes weren’t tears, but blood from its body. Furthermore, the blood had already dried up.</p>
<p>This was a Companion Beast. If it were an ordinary dimensional creature, it might have long died. After this long roar, the Companion Beast completely lost its resistance. It was yanked by the power of the music as its head slammed into the ground as though it was kowtowing.</p>
<p>With this kowtow, its body instantly disintegrated. Most of its body transformed into black gas that rose up and condensed in the air in its Companion Beast shape. Then, it slowly rose into the sky and slowly dissipated.</p>
<p>Something dropped from where the Companion Beast was. The strange crystal had many faces. A few of them had strange patterns engraved on them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found the patterns rather familiar. On careful look, one of the patterns was Treasurefall Money. Another symbol was the electromagnetic monster. A few of the faces had lines without a complete pattern. However, the concepts contained in the lines were vaguely similar to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Xiao’s Trajectory Art.</p>
<p>Is this the Companion Beast’s Calamity-grade essence? Zhou Wen stared at the crystal and thought.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1653'>Chapter 1653 Targeted</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen wished he could immediately lunge forward and snatch the Calamity essence. It was a Heaven-level Calamity essence, and not an ordinary one.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t dare move a step. He had no delusion in front of the bee. Keeping his life was already his greatest wish.</p>
<p>The bee moved the suona away from its mouth and stopped playing.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen and company could heave a sigh of relief, the bee flapped its wings and flew towards them.</p>
<p>The bee didn’t fly quickly as it slowly landed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company didn’t dare move. Only their eyes moved as they watched the bee. The bee held the suona and floated in the air as it slowly landed on the Calamity essence.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang’s tense nerves relaxed a little. Up to now, the bee didn’t seem to have any intention of killing them.</p>
<p>Xiao and Jiuyang weren’t afraid of Calamity-grade creatures. Even against the freaky Companion Beasts from before, they had the ability to fight them to the death. However, the power of the suona had already exceeded the limits of a Calamity-grade creature. They had nearly died from the shockwaves of the suona’s music; there was no need discussing facing it head-on.</p>
<p>The tiny bee wasn’t enough to scare them, but the suona struck terror in them. Even Zhou Wen was no exception.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen still had one last trick up his sleeve, even he didn’t know how useful it was. Therefore, it was best not to have things develop to that point.</p>
<p>The three of them watched as the bee flew to the Calamity essence. It extended its claws and grabbed the Calamity essence, lifting the strange crystal up.</p>
<p>The bee clearly didn’t have the Companion Beast’s ability. It couldn’t directly devour the Calamity essence. It hugged the Calamity essence and wanted to absorb the energy inside.</p>
<p>“That bee might not be the parasitic Companion Beast, but the Companion Beast born on this planet,” Xiao suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were taken aback. They had always imagined that the bee was the Companion Beast that had parasitized this planet’s Companion Beast. After all, it had such a divine artifact in its hand. It seemed to match being the parasitic Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Xiao said, “Didn’t you realize that this planet didn’t change after that Companion Beast died?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Jiuyang immediately realized the problem when they heard Xiao say that.</p>
<p>Once a Companion Beast born from a planet was born, the planet would suffer a destructive blow and explode. It was very likely that half of it would explode like Venus.</p>
<p>However, when the Companion Beast appeared, although it triggered some changes in the planet, the planet functioned normally even after its death.</p>
<p>As for the changes and damage to the planet’s surface, they were relatively inconsequential.</p>
<p>“In that case, that Companion Beast doesn’t look like a Companion Beast born from this planet. It doesn’t have any connection with this planet,” Jiuyang said after some thought.</p>
<p>“If this bee is the Companion Beast born from this planet, why would the divine artifact snatched by the parasitic Companion Beast be in its hands?” Zhou Wen said after some thought. Although he also felt that the Companion Beast didn’t look like the Companion Beast born from this planet, he couldn’t explain this problem.</p>
<p>“This isn’t difficult to explain. After that Companion Beast parasitized the planet’s interior, it wasn’t able to completely control the Companion Beast produced by the planet itself. Instead, the divine artifact was snatched away. Or rather, it had a reason that required it to abandon the divine artifact. It happened to let the Companion Beast produced by the planet pick up the spoils. It’s probably something like that. It’s not easy to guess the exact situation.”</p>
<p>Xiao paused for a moment before continuing, “The reason I said that the bee is the Companion Beast born from this planet is only partly the answer. Another important reason is that although that Companion Beast’s abilities are strange, its strength isn’t compatible with this planet. This bee is different. Its strength vaguely resonates with this planet.”</p>
<p>“Its power resonates with this planet? Why didn’t I discover it?” Jiuyang said in puzzlement, ‘This planet ‘s surface is covered by glaciers. The Companion Beast produced should have some ice-elemental powers, right? That bee doesn’t seem to have any ice-elemental powers, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not an ice-elemental power,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. “Xiao is right. That bee does have an intrinsic connection with this planet. Up to now, this connection has been ongoing.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Jiuyang still didn’t understand what connection Xiao and Zhou Wen were talking about.</p>
<p>“You are just too slow.” Xiao explained helplessly, “Didn’t you realize that the restrictions on this planet haven’t been removed? If that Companion Beast was really born from this planet, even if the planet didn’t explode after it died, the restrictions should have been removed.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Jiuyang sometimes suffered from being slow. It was his nature, but once he was in a situation, things he thought about were more than a normal person’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“If the bee is really the Companion Beast born from this planet and possesses the divine artifact snatched from the mythical battle, and now that it has killed the parasitic Companion Beast, wouldn’t we be in greater danger?” Jiuyang said. Xiao sighed and said, “Indeed. Unless it’s not interested in us at all, our situation is even more dangerous than being pursued by that Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>As the three of them spoke, the bee’s claws hugged the Calamity essence as it flapped its wings and flew towards them. Zhou Wen’s heart immediately chilled. Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t have it easy either. Although the bee didn’t blow the trumpet and there were no music restraints, they could move freely. The restrictions of the planet still existed. As long as they couldn’t leave this planet, even if they instant transmitted to the other end of the planet, it wouldn’t be of much use.</p>
<p>Once the bee’s suona sounded, they would still be required to kneel.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen could only rejoice that this thing hadn’t appeared on Earth. Otherwise, with the suona sounding, 99% of humans around the world would have died. There weren’t many people who could last until they knelt and kowtowed.</p>
<p>Escaping was futile, so none of the trio moved. Their six eyes stared at the slowly approaching bee.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen increasingly felt that something was amiss because the bee was flying straight at</p>
<p>au</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Indeed, the tiny bee flew in front of him without any intention of continuing its flight. It circled Zhou Wen a few times as though it was sizing him up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s muscles tensed up as he prepared to fight to the death.</p>
<p>However, the bee didn’t attack Zhou Wen. After circling a few times, it flew off into the distance.</p>
<p>After flying for a short distance, the bee suddenly stopped. It raised its suona and blew it, aiming it at Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1654'>Chapter 1654 Different Tunes</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately frightened out of his wits. As he retreated with all his might, he ordered the Golden Harp to gather the strength of hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites to fend off the bee’s suona music.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew very well that even the power of hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp couldn’t match the bee’s suona. After all, it was a power that could easily kill Heaven-level creatures.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already had the resolve to kneel. All he could do was place his hopes on the Sigh of the King</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was taken aback when the suona sounded. This was because the music produced by the bee was somewhat different from the tune he had heard before.</p>
<p>If the tune Zhou Wen had heard previously was the beckoning of Death, one filled with grief, then the tune he was hearing now didn’t feel sad at all. It even made him feel happy.</p>
<p>The two extremes of music-one sad, one happy-were actually played from the same musical instrument. It was truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the urge to commit suicide because of the bee’s musical instrument. Although the Essence Energy in his body stirred with the music, it wasn’t the stirrings of an explosion. Instead, it was an indescribable impulse. His Essence Energy became abnormally active, but this activity didn’t cause any damage to his body.</p>
<p>The only difference was that Zhou Wen’s body was similarly restrained in such music. Ignoring instant transmission, even moving was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the force pulling him to his knees. However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>If he knelt, he might be able to trigger the Sigh of the King. Now that he didn’t have to kneel, wouldn’t that mean that he couldn’t even activate the Sigh of the King? He wouldn’t even be able to use his final trump card.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw the bee blowing the suona as it turned around and slowly flew in another direction.</p>
<p>Xiao, Jiuyang, and Zhou Wen were delighted. If this bee didn’t plan on taking their lives and just left, they could survive.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, when the bee turned around and flew away, their bodies followed the bee’s flight uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The Golden Harp orchestrated hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites in a symphony, but it didn’t affect the tune that the bee played. After all, this was completely different from the tune from before. Zhou Wen had never heard this tune before, so it was too late to learn it now.</p>
<p>What does it want? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled, unsure if it was a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>If the bee really wanted them dead, it could just play the tune of death. There was no need to do this.</p>
<p>However, if the bee didn’t want to kill them, it could just release them. Why did it have to play such a strange tune?</p>
<p>The trio was forced to follow the bee. Due to the restrictions of the music, they could only walk on the ground and not fly.</p>
<p>This planet was covered with glacier faults and rubble ruins after the battle. As they walked forward, they couldn’t change their direction. They would occasionally collide with ice and rocks and even fall to the bottom of the cliff, leaving them in a sorry state. Thankfully, the three of them had strong physiques. They only looked pathetic, but they didn’t suffer much damage.</p>
<p>“Where do you think this bee is taking us? Don’t tell me it wants to take us to its nest and store us as food reserves?” Jiuyang said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Jiuyang’s words didn’t sound right, but on careful thought, they made sense.</p>
<p>The bee wasn’t the Companion Beast. It didn’t have an extremely powerful devouring ability. It wasn’t able to directly devour and digest the Companion Beast’s Calamity essence, much less devour the three of them.</p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to take them back and use them as food reserves. “That Holy God of yours is so resourceful; did he not leave any backup plans for you before you came?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“If we had any means, we would have used them long ago. Would we have waited until now?” Xiao curled his lips and said, “However, I think this bee might not have any ill intentions towards us. At the very least, it shouldn’t have any ill intentions towards Jiuyang and me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was even more depressed when he heard that. Xiao was right. The bee had been targeting Zhou Wen from the beginning. Xiao and Jiuyang had only been implicated.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, is there something special on you that attracted that bee?” Xiao asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“If there’s really anything on me that it likes, do you think it won’t directly snatch it?” Zhou Wen said angrily.</p>
<p>Xiao thought for a moment and felt that Zhou Wen was right. If the bee really fancied something on Zhou Wen, it could just kill him and snatch it. There was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p>“If it hasn’t taken a fancy to something, could it have taken a fancy to you?” As Xiao involuntarily walked forward, he sized up Zhou Wen from the side as though he wanted to figure out what about Zhou Wen attracted the bee.</p>
<p>When Jiuyang heard Xiao, he said as though he had come to a realization, “If the bee is really a Companion Beast born from this planet, then the energy of this planet was originally provided to it. Now, at least half of it has been sucked away by that Companion Beast, preventing it from completely evolving. Now, has it chosen Zhou Wen and wants to use his body for parasitization…” Zhou Wen’s face immediately turned pale when he heard that. There was a slight possibility in Jiuyang’s words.</p>
<p>Imagining the scene of the bee drilling into his body and slowly gnawing away at his organs, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shiver.</p>
<p>“No way! In terms of physique and levels, you guys are much stronger than me. If it wants to parasitize someone, it should parasitize your bodies. It shouldn’t be me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily the case. Perhaps the bee likes a talented host like you,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Talented my ass. I’m just an ordinary person…” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Ordinary?” Jiuyang and Xiao looked at him sideways.</p>
<p>They didn’t think so. Zhou Wen’s domain power clearly hadn’t reached the Heaven’s level of perfection. It wasn’t even as complete as a Hell-level domain, but his domain power was actually able to fight a Heaven level existence. Furthermore, he had multiple domains.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying was that there was no sign of the Guardian or other creature’s genes on him. It was as though he was a pure-blooded human who had advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>If such a person was still called an ordinary person, they really didn’t know who else in this world was extraordinary.</p>
<p>As the three of them spoke, the bee had already flown into a glacier rift. The three of them couldn’t help but fall.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The three of them fell to the bottom of the rift and smashed open three ice craters. When they crawled out of the ice craters, they realized that the bee had stopped playing and was looking at an ice cavern.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen traced the bee’s gaze and when he saw the scene inside the ice cave, his eyes widened as his mouth gaped open. He nearly cried out.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1655'>Chapter 1655 Meeting Tsukuyomi Again</h3>
<p>Tsukuyomi isn’t dead! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to see Tsukuyomi sitting cross-legged in the ice cavern.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi hadn’t been able to move. Furthermore, she had been implicated in that earth-shaking battle. Zhou Wen originally imagined that she had most likely encountered misfortune.</p>
<p>He never expected to see Tsukuyomi again. Although her situation didn’t look good, she was still alive. It was fine as long as she was alive.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi sat cross-legged in the ice cavern and circulated her Moonlight Force as though she was healing her injuries. There were no visible injuries on her body. She had probably been disturbed during her evolution and suffered internal injuries.</p>
<p>Why did the bee come to Tsukuyomi? Could it be that it wants to finish us all off? Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he couldn’t care less as he loudly warned Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s voice couldn’t enter the ice cavern because the bee had started playing its suona again. The suona’s sound immediately drowned out Zhou Wen’s voice.</p>
<p>Ignoring Tsukuyomi, who was far away in the ice cavern, even Xiao and Jiuyang, who were nearby, couldn’t hear what he was shouting.</p>
<p>The moment the suona sounded, the trio’s bodies were controlled again. No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t escape its control. Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and the Teacher Domain were useless.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s Evil Warding didn’t have any effect. Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what category the suona’s power came under. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but walk towards the bee, but he quickly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>He walked towards the bee under the music’s control, but Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t walk over. They remained standing where they were.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could even see Xiao and Jiuyang trying their best to move their bodies, but they couldn’t move at all. They stood firmly in place as though they had been nailed there.</p>
<p>It’s over. Could it be as Jiuyang said? This bee wants to parasitize me? Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his back.</p>
<p>Countless thoughts ran through his mind. Just as he was thinking about how he could escape the bee’s control, he saw Tsukuyomi being forced out of the ice cavern. Tsukuyomi clearly saw Zhou Wen as well. She opened her mouth as though she was saying something to him, but due to the influence of the suona, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear what she was saying despite the close distance. She looked rather alarmed, a probable sign that she didn’t know what had happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen regretted not learning lip-reading. If he knew lip-reading, he would at least know what Tsukuyomi was saying, so he wouldn’t be gripped by such anxiety.</p>
<p>The two of them walked towards the bee. As the distance closed, Zhou Wen could roughly hear Tsukuyomi’s words.</p>
<p>“What happened here?” Tsukuyomi asked in panic.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile. Too many things had happened in between, making it impossible to give a quick summary.</p>
<p>“Ignore that for now. Let’s see if there’s any way to escape the suona’s control.” Zhou Wen could only hope that Tsukuyomi had a way to escape the suona’s music.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi should have been at the Hell level before. After absorbing the power of the Moon Essence Basin, if nothing happened in the middle, she should be at the Heaven level. Now, he didn’t know what her situation was or if she had advanced perfectly. If she was already at the Heaven level, she might have a solution.</p>
<p>“I’ve already tried, but none of them worked. That sound is too strange. I can’t affect it with sound-type powers, nor can I affect it with spatial powers,” Tsukuyomi said with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, they had already walked to a point less than fifty meters from each other. Furthermore, they were still approaching. In between them was the suona-playing bee.</p>
<p>“If even you are out of options, then we can only leave it up to fate. I hope that the bee doesn’t want our lives,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only accept it if the bee really wanted to parasitize him. He only hoped that the bee wouldn’t suck him dry after parasitizing him. That way, he would have time to think of a solution.</p>
<p>If there was really no other way, Zhou Wen would make a trip to Chess Mountain. He would rather sign some unfair treaties with The Thearch than have his flesh sucked dry by the bee.</p>
<p>However, the bee’s actions left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>If the bee really wanted to parasitize him, it could only parasitize one person. Then why did it bring Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi over?</p>
<p>Could it be that this fellow wants to choose a host like how an ancient emperor chooses concubines? Does he want to gather all the beautiful girls together and compare them? Zhou Wen thought for a long time but couldn’t figure out what the bee was up to.</p>
<p>The two of them were already in close proximity to the bee. The distance between Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi was only a step or two before the two of them finally stopped and stood facing each other. The bee’s music also stopped, but Zhou Wen realized that his body was still being controlled – he couldn’t move freely.</p>
<p>“What happened here?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Sigh, I also want to know what happened,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh. Although he had watched the bee appear from the very beginning, he really didn’t know what it was up to.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi was about to say something when she heard an earth-shattering suona blare.</p>
<p>The bee was just above the two of them. It was just too close to them. The suona sounded even clearer than before. It was as though it reached into their souls, causing their souls to tremble.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although the sound was a little terrifying, it didn’t seem to do anything substantial. Apart from being unable to move, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was guessing what the bee meant, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. Something had automatically flown out of the Chaos Bead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. After all, the chaos space in the Chaos Bead was equivalent to another spacetime. Unless Zhou Wen opened the Chaos Bead himself, the things inside shouldn’t be affected by the outside world.</p>
<p>Now that something had flown out, it was clearly affected by the suona. This left Zhou Wen even more alarmed at its power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the thing that had flown out of the Chaos Bead was a token. It was the Heavenly Happiness Token that Emperor of Shang had given him.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Happiness Token was actually a palm-sized stone token. There was a red “joy” character on it. At that moment, the Heavenly Happiness Token floated between Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi. The originally ordinary stone token shimmered with a strange glow.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1656'>Chapter 1656 Paying Respects to the Heavens and Earth</h3>
<p>The sudden appearance of the Heavenly Happiness Token made Zhou Wen immediately realize something</p>
<p>When Emperor of Shang gave him the Heavenly Happiness Token, he didn’t say anything. He even gave it very casually as though it was nothing important. However, ever since Zhou Wen obtained the Heavenly Happiness Token, what happened around it made him vaguely understand that it was definitely important.</p>
<p>Just the characteristic of allowing a Calamity creature to stay on Earth was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>On Earth, other than humans, all creatures would be forced to leave Earth for the universe once they advanced to the Calamity grade. If they stayed, they would definitely be suppressed by the rules or they would seal themselves. Only by weakening their strength to below the Calamity grade could they stay on Earth.</p>
<p>The most direct example was the antelope. A strong fellow like the antelope was definitely at the Calamity grade, and it wasn’t an ordinary Calamity-grade. Its usual cultivation was always in a sealed state. Even if it was heavily injured, it didn’t dare release its strength.</p>
<p>With the standards of humans now, if Calamity creatures could stay on Earth, how was it possible for humanity to survive? Earth would have long been ruled by the dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Now, the Heavenly Happiness Token was dazzling. Streams of light circulated in euphoria. It was like a red lantern hanging above Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Boo… Boo… Boo…</p>
<p>The bee continued using all its strength as it kept blowing the suona. As the suona music sounded, the light on the Heavenly Happiness Token intensified. Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but turn towards the Heavenly Happiness Token.</p>
<p>“Xiao, why do I find this scene a little familiar!” Jiuyang, who was standing by the side, frowned as he looked at the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>Xiao said with a strange expression, “If I’m not wrong, what they are doing now seems to be a tradition of ancient times.”</p>
<p>Jiuyang’s eyes lit up when he heard Xiao. “That’s right. That’s right. It’s a kind of tradition… What’s the name of that tradition again…”</p>
<p>As many traditional customs had already vanished in the Federation, much less Jiuyang, who was born in the Holy Land. He only occasionally read some historical information, so he didn’t have a deep impression of it. He couldn’t recall it immediately.</p>
<p>“Paying respects to the heavens and earth,” Xiao said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s a ceremony to pay respects to the heavens and earth done during weddings in the East District’s ancient times. There’s no mistake about it. I chanced upon it when reading. The music that used to be played seems very similar to the music played by the bee… How should I put it… It’s festive…” Jiuyang’s expression turned odd. “But this is too strange. A Companion Beast born on a distant planet actually knows the tradition that few humans know of. It even wants to force Zhou Wen to pay respects to the heavens and earth with a dimensional creature. This is too bizarre. What does it want? Is this really about paying respects to the heavens and earth?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think… it’s wrong…” Xiao looked at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi in thought.</p>
<p>“If I remember correctly, there are a total of three steps. First, paying respect to the heavens and the earth, then paying respect to the ancestors. Finally, both husband and wife will pay respect to each other. After that, they will be sent into the bridal chamber for consummation to be truly considered husband and wife and…” As Jiuyang spoke, he heard the bee’s suona turn loud and profound. The entire suona was raised by it as it blew into the void with all its strength as though it was paying respects to something.</p>
<p>With the suona sounding, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but kneel towards the Heavenly Happiness Token and slowly kowtow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi had naturally heard Xiao and Jiuyang’s conversation. Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange at all. The Heavenly Happiness Token was something that dealt with marriage. For it to appear, Zhou Wen refused to believe that it had nothing to do with marriage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any feelings for paying respect to the heavens and earth. Even if he really did so with Tsukuyomi, the Heavenly Happiness Token-invoked nuptial didn’t mean anything Ignoring the fact that both of them were forced, even if they weren’t, it wasn’t difficult for modern people to get a divorce.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen was worried about was why the bee was doing this. What benefits would his marriage with Tsukuyomi bring to the bee?</p>
<p>Wait, could it be… Zhou Wen thought of a possibility and felt his scalp tingle.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Happiness Token’s ability was very likely not just carrying out a rite. Otherwise, it would be useless for such a divine artifact to be created just for a nuptial.</p>
<p>If the Heavenly Happiness Token had a more specific use, it was very likely that this effect would allow Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi to enter the bridal chamber. It was even possible that they could directly conceive.</p>
<p>Recalling the guess that the bee wanted to parasitize him, Zhou Wen’s back was already covered in cold sweat. He increasingly felt that the bee wanted to parasitize their descendants.</p>
<p>Typically, humans and dimensional creatures definitely had incompatible reproductive organs, but something like the Heavenly Happiness Token was very odd. It might have a special effect to break through such restrictions.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more terrified he became. He tried his best not to kneel, but his body involuntarily sank. He couldn’t stop it at all. All he could do was delay it a little.</p>
<p>On the other side, Tsukuyomi was also struggling with all her might, but it didn’t have much of an effect.</p>
<p>“No matter what it wants, I won’t let something you don’t like happen,” Tsukuyomi suddenly said. Her tone was odd as though it was filled with determination.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi knelt side by side. Upon hearing her voice, he could only use the corner of his eye to look at Tsukuyomi. He saw her expression turn apodictic as a strange force was brewing in her. “You have a solution?” Zhou Wen was delighted. Since Tsukuyomi still had powers to use, they might be able to escape their present predicament.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Tsukuyomi nodded.</p>
<p>“Then quickly use it. I can’t hold on any longer. If you don’t use it, I’ll really kneel down.” Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that as he hurriedly urged Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry. I’ve said it before. No one can force you to do something you don’t like in front of me.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, the force in her body intensified. Her entire body was like a volcano that was about to erupt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suddenly felt that something was amiss. He realized that blood was beginning to seep out of Tsukuyomi’s eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. The strength in her body was expanding as though it was about to explode. “What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“The Heavenly Happiness Token can forcefully facilitate a marriage, but marriage is ultimately between two people. As long as one of them dies, the Heavenly Happiness Token will naturally be useless…” Tsukuyomi said.</p>
<p>“You are self-destructing!? Stop!” Zhou Wen immediately shouted.</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s strength showed no signs of stopping. Instead, it swelled even more. It was as though moonlight was seeping out of Tsukuyomi’s skin, making her body turn crystalline. Energy surged in her as though she would immediately explode. “I’ve said it before. As long as I’m around, no one can force you to do something you don’t like.” Tsukuyomi’s eyes were resolute, but she revealed a smile on her face and slowly said, “This is all I can do for you… Take care…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1657'>Chapter 1657 Sigh of the King Reappears</h3>
<p>Tsukuyomi’s eyes were firm, resolute, and stubborn, but there was sorrow, sadness, relief, liberation, reluctance, pain, and other complicated emotions hidden deep in her eyes.</p>
<p>Even a heartless person would probably melt when they saw Tsukuyomi’s eyes. They would be moved by the sincere emotions and feel pity for her.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen was only a little slow-witted; he wasn’t truly heartless.</p>
<p>“Tsukuyomi, stop. I’ve never said I’m unwilling… Stop quickly…” Zhou Wen’s emotions went through upheavals as he couldn’t help but shout.</p>
<p>However, Tsukuyomi didn’t stop. She smiled bitterly and said, “There’s no need for you to force yourself. I’ve said it before. No one can force you to do something you aren’t willing to</p>
<p>much less sympathy…” Zhou Wen saw that Tsukuyomi was already on the brink of self-destruction and didn’t have the time to convince her. Therefore, he roared, “Stop when I tell you to. Cut the crap. Don’t I know what I want? If I want you to live, you should live. If I don’t want you dead, you aren’t allowed to die. From now on, you will do whatever I say.”</p>
<p>Tsukuyomi watched in a daze as her eyes gradually softened. The energy fluctuations on her body finally stopped expanding, but they didn’t dissipate.</p>
<p>“Do you know what it will entail if we kneel down? It’s not a simple ritual, but truly becoming husband and wife. Are you really willing?” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen and asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course. If not, I wouldn’t have let you live,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Although it was good to keep Tsukuyomi alive, it was difficult to predict what the bee would do to them next. If it was really as he thought, the bee’s target was the descendant embryo of him and Tsukuyomi, it would be troublesome.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll listen to you. If you don’t want me dead, I won’t die…” Tsukuyomi’s cheeks flushed as she said lovingly. At this moment, the two of them couldn’t hold on any longer. Zhou Wen’s knees were about to touch the ground, and the distance he was from the ground was only the height of a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already resigned himself to fate and gave up resisting. He planned to take things one step at a time to see what the bee was up to.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen gave up on resisting and his knee was about to touch the ground, a force erupted from his body, causing his knee to bounce up from the ground as he stood straight.</p>
<p>“Scram!” A voice sounded from Zhou Wen’s body. It sounded like it came from his mouth, but Zhou Wen’s mouth didn’t move.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that voice wasn’t a man’s voice, but a woman’s.</p>
<p>With the word “scram,” the bee that was playing the suona seemed to be struck by lightning as it suddenly flew backward. The suona in its claws fell out.</p>
<p>The dazzling Heavenly Happiness Token lost all its luster and fell from the sky, returning to its original stone form. Before Zhou Wen could react, he saw a shadow flash from his body. Demonic Neonate had rushed out of his body and caught the suona in the air. She held it to her mouth and puffed up her cheeks before blowing at the bee.</p>
<p>The loud suona music penetrated straight to the soul, causing everyone’s heads to buzz. It was as though their souls were about to be blown out of their bodies.</p>
<p>The bee was the first to bear the brunt of the attack. It became dizzy, and its body kept spinning in the air. It looked like it was losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen was Demonic Neonate’s master or perhaps Demonic Neonate had deliberately not allowed the suona’s sound to affect Zhou Wen, but regardless of the reason, Zhou Wen wasn’t affected. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the Demon Dragon King armor and borrowed the power of eight Companion Beasts. Then, he injected all his strength into the Golden Wyrm Scissors and snipped at the dizzy bee.</p>
<p>Although the bee was very powerful, it was only at the Heaven level. It hadn’t reached the Apocalypse grade and was affected by the suona’s music. It was already powerless to fight the Golden Wyrm Scissors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason it was so strong was that the suona played a huge role. Without the suona, the bee was at most similar to the Companion Beast from before or even inferior.</p>
<p>Just as the bee’s fate was about to be sealed, it suddenly flapped its wings with all its might and transformed into a stream of light to escape, hoping to put up a final struggle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chased with the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand. Now, he naturally couldn’t let the bee off.</p>
<p>However, to everyone’s surprise, the bee’s figure flashed and landed diagonally on Tsukuyomi. It hid behind her as though it was afraid and stole a glance at Demonic Neonate before stabbing its head into Tsukuyomi’s neck, turning into a Companion Beast tattoo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi in a daze as Tsukuyomi’s gentle and shy expression gradually turned embarrassed.</p>
<p>As though realizing something, Tsukuyomi’s expression instantly changed to pleasant surprise. “Zhou Wen, you’re really amazing. This Companion Beast is afraid of you. It automatically contracted with me and became my Companion Beast. As expected of my husband…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and didn’t say</p>
<p>patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder. “Zhou Wen, it’s worth it to be deceived by a woman who’s</p>
<p>Xiao didn’t say anything and only gestured at Tsukuyomi with a thumbs up gesture. “We’ll be leaving now.” With that said, Xiao reached out and pulled Jiuyang. The two of them immediately vanished into the void. Only Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were left on the dilapidated planet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally understood why a smart woman like Tsukuyomi would choose such a dangerous planet as her residence and choose to absorb the Moon Essence Basin here.</p>
<p>Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought too much about it. Now that he thought about it carefully, he immediately felt that there was definitely something fishy. Coupled with the fact that the bee had become Tsukuyomi’s Companion Beast at the critical moment of life and death, he was certain that Tsukuyomi had long known about the planet and had even begun setting up the whole thing. It was definitely not a coincidence that she had chosen to stay here to absorb the Moon Essence Basin.</p>
<p>Their eyes met and the atmosphere was a little awkward.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Zhou Wen, listen to my explanation…” Tsukuyomi looked into Zhou Wen’s eyes as her cheeks flushed red.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to explain. It’s good that you’re fine. I should return.” Zhou Wen wasn’t angry. Tsukuyomi didn’t harm him. Even if they had finished the nuptials at the end, it wouldn’t have been as dangerous as he imagined</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate held the suona and flew back to Zhou Wen’s side. She transformed back into a tattoo and even the suona vanished.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1658'>Chapter 1658 Terrible News</h3>
<p>I nearly succeeded. How infuriating. Tsukuyomi clenched her fists angrily when she saw Zhou Wen teleport away, but she didn’t know how to vent her anger. She was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>What’s the power that repelled the parasitic bee and the Life-and-Death Suona? I seem to hear a voice that doesn’t belong to Zhou Wen. Could it be that there’s a terrifying existence hidden in Zhou Wen’s body? After calming down, Tsukuyomi’s puzzlement intensified. Thoughts constantly flashed through her mind. Why is that terrifying existence hidden in Zhou Wen’s body? What’s her relationship with Zhou Wen? Will it harm Zhou Wen? No, I have to think of a way to figure it out.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, she couldn’t return to Earth now. Furthermore, because of that matter, Zhou Wen definitely didn’t trust her. It would probably be difficult to resolve the problem if she went to Zhou Wen now.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to think of a solution. Tsukuyomi narrowed her eyes in thought as her mind raced.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t as Tsukuyomi had imagined. He was already a little used to Tsukuyomi’s style of doing things. Even if he was deceived, he wasn’t surprised. He even felt that it was only right and proper. He wasn’t angry at all. Of course, this didn’t mean that Zhou Wen had become foolish from all the lies. It was only because Zhou Wen knew very well that no matter how Tsukuyomi lied to him, she wouldn’t really harm him.</p>
<p>After teleporting back to Earth, Zhou Wen returned to Guide City. As interstellar teleportation had a certain deviation, Zhou Wen appeared near the ancient city.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to return to the base, he suddenly sensed something. He turned his head and saw a white-robed man standing by the lake.</p>
<p>A breeze blew gently from the lake, causing the white-haired, dragon-horned man’s clothes to flutter as though he would ride the wind at any moment.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” Zhou Wen’s body trembled. Although he only saw a figure, he recognized it at a glance.</p>
<p>“Little Wen.” The white-robed man turned around and smiled at Zhou Wen. It was Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>“Teacher, why are you here?” Zhou Wen was delighted to see Wang Mingyuan again. With Wang Mingyuan’s current status, he definitely wouldn’t casually return to Earth, much less just come to drink tea and chat with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood there, momentarily unsure if he should run to Wang Mingyuan as he stood there in a daze. “You’ve grown up.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and turned around again. With his back facing Zhou Wen, he looked at the ancient city enveloped by the misty rain and said, “When you’re young, there are many things you can avoid. You didn’t have to make choices because someone was standing at a high vantage point to shield you from the elements. However, as you gradually grow up, the person who shielded you from the elements would no longer be as tall as you. There would be no way to protect you in a world with no multiple choice questions. That’s when it’s time for you to make a choice.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, what do you want me to choose?” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan and ultimately didn’t walk over.</p>
<p>“Earth’s seal is weakening. Before long, all the dimensional zones will break out,” Wang Mingyuan said. “I know.” Zhou Wen nodded with a heavy expression. More and more dimensional zones had been breached in recent times. It probably wouldn’t be long before they were completely breached.</p>
<p>“When all dimensional zones break out, it will be when Earth’s Companion Beast appears.” Wang Mingyuan’s words immediately made Zhou Wen tremble.</p>
<p>“That fast!?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>According to the present situation, it would probably only be a year or two before the dimensional zones were completely breached. If Earth’s Companion Beast were to appear, wouldn’t Earth be doomed?</p>
<p>“Perhaps it will be faster than you imagine.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and said, “Furthermore, this isn’t the worst.”</p>
<p>“What’s worse than this?” Zhou Wen felt that his young heart couldn’t withstand such a blow.</p>
<p>If Earth’s destruction wasn’t the worst situation, he really couldn’t fathom what could be worse.</p>
<p>“When that happens, the entire universe’s rules that suppress the dimension will be lifted. In fact, the suppression of the universe’s rules on the dimension has already begun to weaken,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly. Towards the end, the smile on his face completely vanished.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen asked in horror.</p>
<p>He knew very well how terrifying such a situation would be. The reason why humans could survive, or rather, the entire universe where Earth was located, could maintain a relatively peaceful state, was all because of the universe’s rules of suppression on the dimension.</p>
<p>Without this nomological suppression, all creatures in the universe would face a huge disaster, much less humans.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t answer Zhou Wen as he continued, “This is a disaster, but it’s also an opportunity.”</p>
<p>“What opportunity?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand. If the dimension really launched a large-scale invasion, what chance would humanity have?</p>
<p>“No one has found Earth’s Companion Beast yet, nor does anyone know which dimensional zone on Earth will determine the ownership of Earth’s Companion Beast. Even if the top experts of the dimension descend, they wouldn’t dare rashly invade Earth. They still need humans as their representatives to vie for Earth’s Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Is there a need? If the dimension’s Apocalypse-grade powerhouses can really descend completely on Earth, they have the ability to clear all the dimensional zones. Why go through so much trouble?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“They also want to do so, but unfortunately, they wouldn’t dare.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t dare?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they wouldn’t dare. Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses will be afraid.” “What are they afraid of? What on Earth is making them afraid?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had a nagging feeling that this might be the crux of everything. “I don’t know what on Earth makes them afraid either. However, the former strongest expert of the dimension rushed into Earth with supreme might and nearly cracked it. However, he ultimately failed to come out and vanished from the face of the earth,” Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>“Is it that ship with a woman’s portrait?” Zhou Wen immediately thought of the woman’s portrait and the anchor.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan nodded. “Therefore, even if the suppression of the cosmic rules disappears, the dimension won’t completely invade Earth for the time being. They need some representatives to figure out what’s on Earth for them.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Wang Mingyuan continued, “There are many races in the dimension now, but there are a total of seven truly powerful races. You shouldn’t be too unfamiliar with them. The six Holy Temples represent the six powerful races of the dimension. However, the strongest in the dimension isn’t these six races, but the Immortals.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen did some calculations and realized that he wasn’t a stranger to them at all. He had dealt with many people in the Holy Land and had a grudge with the Immortals. With this in mind, he had offended all seven of the strongest races in the dimension.</p>
<p>In the future, when the dimension fully descended, he felt that his living environment would become abnormally harsh.</p>
<p>“Since the Immortals are so strong, why didn’t they establish a Holy Temple in the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled by this.</p>
<p>“Previously, the strongest expert from the dimension who descended on Earth came from the Immortals—they were a race that all submitted to. Back then, even the union of the six Holy races had to submit to the Immortals. Unfortunately, the Immortal who made all races submit vanished from Earth,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1659'>Chapter 1659 Choosing My Own Path</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s hair stood on end when he heard that. Such a powerful existence had actually vanished from Earth. It was no wonder the terrifying existences in the dimension were so wary of Earth.</p>
<p>“After the Immortals suffered that heavy blow, the six Holy races were able to rise up and become the rulers of the dimension. Even so, they needed the six races to join forces to suppress the heavily weakened Immortals. After so many years, even if the six Holy races join forces, it will be difficult for them to completely suppress the present-day Immortals. The possibility of them ruling the world again is very high.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan paused for a moment before continuing, “The descent of the dimension is inevitable. The various races will seek out their representatives on Earth. The Immortals hope that you can become their representative. If you agree, the matter between Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal will be written off.”</p>
<p>“If I become the representative of the Immortals, wouldn’t that be equivalent to helping the Immortals destroy Earth?” Zhou Wen said after some thought. Wang Mingyuan smiled and said, “Then you have to ask yourself.” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan in a daze, unsure what he meant. Without explaining, Wang Mingyuan threw an item at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen caught it and saw that it was an ice crystal-like ring.</p>
<p>“You are already at the age where you can make your own choices. Think about it slowly. If you are willing to become the representative of the Immortals, crush that ring,” Wang Mingyuan said as his figure gradually turned ethereal, as though he was about to turn transparent. “Teacher, if it were you, what would you choose?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“My path might not be suitable for you,” Wang Mingyuan said as he finally turned around. His transparent body floated in the air as he looked gently at Zhou Wen and said, “Some people choose to walk towards heaven, while others choose to walk towards hell. No matter where they go, they just have to follow their hearts.</p>
<p>“If you walk to hell one day, don’t be afraid or hesitant. Stretch out your hand. There will definitely be a hand waiting for you at a spot within reach.” With that last word, Wang Mingyuan’s body completely vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the spot where Wang Mingyuan had vanished and didn’t move for a long time.</p>
<p>“In an era where all the gods are about to descend to the mortal world, what’s the difference between walking to heaven and walking to hell?” After a long while, Zhou Wen sighed and put away the ring.</p>
<p>When he returned to Guide City, he found the situation there wanting. Li Xuan, Qin Zhen, Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and company were busy fighting everywhere to ensure the safety of the base.</p>
<p>Recently, more and more break-out creatures had rushed out of dimensional zones near Guide City. If not for the fact that Li Xuan and company were top experts among humans, the base would have long been razed to the ground.</p>
<p>Even with so many experts gathered in Guide City, ordinary citizens had recently suffered casualties. Although there weren’t many, it was enough to make one wary.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you’re finally back. We have to find the dimensional zone to build a city as soon as possible. There’s no way to defend this crappy place,” Li Xuan said gloomily when he saw Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that Li Xuan wasn’t in a good mood. His eyes were bloodshot. If even Li Xuan, who had an almost immortal body, looked so exhausted, the others must be suffering even more. “It’s time to find a dimensional zone to build a city. Is Xia Xuanyue still here?” Zhou Wen knew that it would probably be difficult to find a suitable dimensional zone to build a city in a short period of time. If there was no other way, he could only cooperate with the Xia family.</p>
<p>“She’s been here the entire time and has helped us quite a bit. Recently, there have been too many break-out creatures appearing. We don’t have enough manpower, and Xia Xuanyue and the Xia family have contributed quite a bit,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll meet her.” Upon hearing Li Xuan’s words, Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan had tacitly agreed to cooperate with the Xia family.</p>
<p>The Xia family was quite sincere. Break-out creatures had recently appeared with high frequencies. Many families that had come to observe had already evacuated Guide City.</p>
<p>For Xia Xuanyue to still lead people to help guard the base at this time showed the Xia family’s sincerity.</p>
<p>“By the way, Sis Yuzhi is here. She has been of great help to us recently,” Li Xuan hurriedly added when he saw Zhou Wen preparing to leave.</p>
<p>“Why is she here? Who else from the Zhang family is here?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Others might not know Zhang Yuzhi’s background, but Zhou Wen knew very well that the entire Zhang family treated her like a treasure, afraid that anything would happen to her.</p>
<p>Ignoring a dangerous place like Guide City, even in the Zhang family’s dimensional zone, Zhang Yuzhi would have many people protecting her.</p>
<p>The Zhang family had actually sent Zhang Yuzhi to Guide City, exceeding Zhou Wen’s expectations.</p>
<p>“There’s also Zhang Xiao and a White Crane team. From what Sis Yuzhi said, the Zhang family seems interested in investing in us.” Li Xuan’s tone suddenly turned suggestive as he lowered his voice and said, “However, I don’t know if the Zhang family is interested in us or if Sis Yuzhi is interested in someone.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Zhou Wen glared at him angrily. “With Sis Yuzhi’s importance to the Zhang family, if it wasn’t for the Zhang family’s ulterior motives, how could they have let her come here? Even if Sis Yuzhi agreed, the Zhang family wouldn’t have let her come.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that might be exactly what they want. Speaking of which, you aren’t young anymore. Although Sis Yuzhi is a little older than us, she’s definitely not considered old. It’s not bad to have a mature woman, so consider it,” Li Xuan said with a silly smile. “You still have time to think about this. From the looks of it, there’s no rush to build a city,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Don’t, it’s best if you quickly find a dimensional zone to build the city. If this continues, even if I can hold on, the others will collapse,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Where are Xia Xuanyue and Sis Yuzhi now?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“They are all in the Fuyue Estate. A group of dimensional creatures was cleared last night. They are probably resting now. Xia Xuanyue and the Xia family live in Block 9 while Sis Yuzhi and Zhang Xiao live in Block 10.” Li Xuan gave Zhou Wen the detailed address.</p>
<p>“Why did you arrange for them to be so close?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Li Xuan said helplessly, “I didn’t arrange it. They requested it themselves. The Xia family and the Zhang family have a good relationship. They said that they can take care of each other by living closer to each other.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. After bidding Li Xuan farewell, he headed for the Fuyue Estate and quickly arrived at the district.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Zhou Wen walked towards Block 9, hoping to discuss the dimensional zone with Xia Xuanyue.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Just as he was about to reach Block 9, he heard someone call his name. He turned his head and saw Zhang Yuzhi standing at the entrance of Block 10, waving at him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re here for me, right?” Just as Zhou Wen was about to turn around and walk over, he realized that Xia Xuanyue had walked out of Block 9 and greeted him with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1660'>Chapter 1660 A City for You</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Xia Xuanyue before looking at Zhang Yuzhi. After some thought, he said, “Time is tight. Let’s have a chat together.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gathered the two of them over but didn’t enter the building. He sat down in the garden pavilion in the district. With the Xia and Zhang families guarding outside, he wasn’t afraid of anyone disturbing them.</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, you previously said that there is a suitable dimensional zone that can be used to build a city. I have intentions of cooperating, but I can only decide after seeing the exact situation of that dimensional zone. Don’t worry, we can sign a contract first. As long as we use the dimensional zones you provide to build a city, I won’t give you a single cent less,” Zhou Wen said bluntly, having no intention of being gratuitous.</p>
<p>He knew that time was of the essence. In the next year or two, the dimensional zones would completely break out. When that happened, without a dimensional zone as a refuge, hundreds of thousands of people would probably die. “With the Federation’s current situation, what’s the point of signing a contract?” Xia Xuanyue smiled and continued, “Since I’m here, I naturally trust you. There’s no need to sign a contract. I can take you there anytime.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Zhang Yuzhi beat him to it. “Wait, Little Wen, why didn’t you ask me before if you’re trying to find a dimensional zone to establish a city?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “Sis Yuzhi, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi said, “In terms of geomancy, which family in the world can compare to our Zhang family? Let alone finding a place to build a city, even if you want to find a place to build a palace, I can help you find the best spot.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi’s words sounded like bragging, but when Zhou Wen thought about it, it did seem to make sense. The Zhang family specialized in this, so although it was a problem for Zhou Wen and company, she could probably resolve it easily.</p>
<p>When Xia Xuanyue heard Zhang Yuzhi say that, she curled her lips and said, “I admit that your Zhang family’s knowledge of geomancy is indeed unparalleled in the world. You guys are probably the best if you’re trying to find a grave site, but it’s not necessarily the case when it comes to finding the dimensional zone. Zhou Wen, you have to think carefully. Don’t use the lives of hundreds of thousands of people to verify their knowledge.”</p>
<p>What Xia Xuanyue said makes sense. Even if the art of geomancy can really deduce where there are dimensional zones, how can I deduce if that dimensional zone is suitable for building a city? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t angered when she heard that. She continued indifferently, “Little Wen, I’ll take you there to take a look first. See if it’s suitable for you.”</p>
<p>Dres</p>
<p>“Sis, what are the Zhang family’s conditions?” Zhou Wen knew the principle of settling scores clearly even between brothers. Furthermore, Zhang Yuzhi didn’t only represent herself, but she also had the Zhang family’s interests behind her.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by conditions? This is my greeting gift to you.” Zhang Yuzhi smiled and said, “I’m me, and the Zhang family is the Zhang family. You helped me so much in the past, so what’s wrong with giving you a home? Regardless of whether you will cooperate with the Zhang family in the future, it has nothing to do with this matter. Furthermore, I don’t wish for you to cooperate with the Zhang family.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi’s last sentence left Xia Xuanyue and Zhou Wen stunned.</p>
<p>The first half of the sentence was understandable. Be it Zhang Yuzhi’s true thoughts or her desire to build a good relationship with Zhou Wen, those words made sense.</p>
<p>However, her last sentence didn’t make sense. As a member of the Zhang family, Zhang Yuzhi didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to cooperate with the Zhang family. It was baffling.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to ask why, but he held back. There were too many people here, so it wouldn’t be nice to ask. He planned on asking her in private later.</p>
<p>However, Xia Xuanyue suddenly thought of something. She glanced at Zhang Yuzhi before saying meaningfully to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, the dimensional zone I plan on introducing to you is Diqiu. I can guarantee that our Xia family discovered that dimensional zone first. It’s unlike some families who rely on their intelligence to do despicable deeds.”</p>
<p>Clearly, Xia Xuanyue suspected that the Zhang family had stolen information about the Xia family and wanted to use the same dimensional zone to cooperate with Zhou Wen. She didn’t believe a word Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>After all, Guide City had many strange dimensional zones. How could it be so easy to find another dimensional zone suitable for establishing a city? The possibility of it being the same dimensional zone was extremely high.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Zhang family had stolen the information from the Xia family, Xia Xuanyue had said it first. If it was really the same dimensional zone, it wouldn’t be nice for the Zhang family to continue vying for it. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the name Diqiu.</p>
<p>Legend had it that Emperor Ku of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was buried there. Everyone felt that there should be a dimensional zone there, but no one found it.</p>
<p>Ignoring the question of whether it was suitable for establishing a city, it was already amazing for the Xia family to have found the Diqiu dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi, wanting to know if the dimensional zone Zhang Yuzhi mentioned was Diqiu.</p>
<p>The corners of Zhang Yuzhi’s mouth curled up slightly as she said disdainfully, “Some people like to project themselves on others when judging them. Our Zhang family naturally knows about a dimensional zone like the Digiu dynasty, but it’s a cemetery after all. Even the tomb of Emperor Ku can’t change the fact that it’s a haunted place. That’s a place for the dead. Why would I get Little Wen to build a city in that place? Wouldn’t that be building a city for the dead?”</p>
<p>“Oh, then I would like to know where the dimensional zone your Zhang family chose is,” Xia Xuanyue said as she stared at Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“It’s not Diqiu anyway. As for where it is, it has nothing to do with your Xia family,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and got up. “Let’s go. I’ll take you to see that dimensional zone now. As for Diqiu, there’s no point in going.”</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, if we use Diqiu City in the future, the Xia family will definitely have a share. Don’t worry about that.” Zhou Wen explained to Xia Xuanyue before being pulled away by Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>After leaving the district and finding no one around, Zhou Wen asked Zhang Yuzhi, “Sis, where is the dimensional zone you mentioned?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know when we get there.” Zhang Yuzhi blinked, but she didn’t tell Zhou Wen the answer. All she did was pull him forward. Zhang Xiao and the members of the White Crane team protected Zhang Yuzhi without speaking to Zhou Wen. Even Zhang Xiao, who had always had a problem with Zhou Wen, didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>As they traveled, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. The path Zhang Yuzhi had taken him on was the one near Guide City. He had been to all these places before, and he knew the dimensional zones here. There weren’t any dimensional zones that were suitable for establishing a city.</p>
<p>When Zhang Yuzhi stopped, Zhou Wen looked at the familiar ancient city and moat and asked with an odd expression, “Don’t tell me the dimensional zone you mentioned is here?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s Guide Ancient City. If you want to build a city, the city is already here. You can even save the money needed to build it. Aren’t I good to you?” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1661'>Chapter 1661 Entering the Ancient City Again</h3>
<p>“Sis, are you joking?” Zhou Wen’s face darkened.</p>
<p>Others might not know, but he knew very well how terrifying the existence inside the ancient city was. Even though Zhou Wen could already match Heaven-level creatures, he still didn’t dare rashly enter the ancient city.</p>
<p>Before reaching the three conditions mentioned by the humanoid creature, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk to enter the ancient city again.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi said in all seriousness, “Of course not. There are indeed terrifying existences in the ancient city. The various factions have actually been trying to probe the situation inside, but those who entered basically didn’t come out alive. We don’t know much about the situation inside, and my family was lucky to learn of the situation inside.”</p>
<p>“Since you know this, you should know that the ancient city can’t be used as a human city.” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in puzzlement, unsure why she had made such a suggestion.</p>
<p>“Others might not know, but have you forgotten what abilities I have?” Zhang Yuzhi said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s not good for you to use that ability, right?” Zhou Wen knew what kind of ability Zhang Yuzhi had, but Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t willing to use such an ability herself. Therefore, he had never thought of getting Zhang Yuzhi to use her ability to help him.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be nice if I killed my friend, but as long as I don’t harm my friend, there’s naturally nothing wrong,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she blinked.</p>
<p>“How do I build a city without killing that creature?” Zhou Wen was puzzled. If he didn’t kill it, how could he occupy the ancient city?</p>
<p>“As long as I’m here, the terrifying creatures in the city will always be my friends. My friends naturally won’t harm my friends, so won’t you be able to build a city?” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Well… You can’t stay here forever, right?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in a daze before saying</p>
<p>“Why not? I came here to join you. I won’t return to Mount Dragon Tiger again. Don’t tell me you won’t take me in?” Zhang Yuzhi looked very serious without any intention of joking.</p>
<p>“Even if you are willing, the Zhang family won’t let you stay here forever, right?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the Zhang family was willing to let Zhang Yuzhi stay outside. She was the Zhang family’s supreme treasure.</p>
<p>“Why not? It was the family’s decision. I’ll stay here with you in the future. There’s no need to return. I don’t need to care about the Zhang family’s matters anymore,” Zhang Yuzhi said. Zhou Wen still had his concerns. Even if the Zhang family was willing to let Zhang Yuzhi stay, what if the Zhang family made her leave in the future?</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen and company entered the ancient city, wouldn’t everyone be doomed once Zhang Yuzhi left? Even if Zhang Yuzhi didn’t leave, wouldn’t Zhou Wen be controlled by the Zhang family if they used her as a threat?</p>
<p>No matter how Zhou Wen thought about it, he felt that the ancient city couldn’t be accepted. However, Zhang Yuzhi had already pulled him towards the ancient city’s entrance. As they walked, she said, “I know what you’re worried about. If you are willing to take me in, I’ll be a part of Guide City in the future. It’s naturally impossible for me to ignore Guide City. Without your permission, I definitely won’t leave the ancient city. Furthermore, even if I want to leave, I’m afraid there won’t be a home to return to.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was alarmed, imagining that something had happened to the Zhang family. “Chunqiu wants me to tell you that after I enter Guide City, I can’t treat myself as a member of the Zhang family.” Zhang Yuzhi’s expression darkened.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand why the Zhang family was willing to release Zhang Yuzhi. To the Zhang family, Zhang Yuzhi was their most precious wealth. Yet, they were giving their most precious wealth to an outsider. He really couldn’t figure out why the Zhang family was doing this.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu said that the dimensional zones on Earth will soon undergo a large-scale breakout. It will happen in only a year or two. He doesn’t know how long the Zhang family can defend the fort, so he got me to come here and leave a way out for them. If Mount Dragon Tiger can’t be defended one day, with me here, the Zhang family can still have a place to stay.” Zhang Yuzhi recounted Zhang Chunqiu’s words without hiding anything.</p>
<p>“What makes Zhang Chunqiu think that I’ll definitely be able to defend this place? The environment here isn’t much better than Mount Dragon Tiger.” Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that.</p>
<p>Guide City had many myths and legends. There were countless immortals from all walks of life. Zhou Wen wasn’t completely confident that he could defend it if all the dimensional zones were breached.</p>
<p>However, the Zhang family had actually deduced that all the dimensional zones on Earth were about to break out. The timing was about as Wang Mingyuan had said. They were indeed capable.</p>
<p>“Chunqiu said that if there’s a final human city on Earth, it will definitely be yours,” Zhang Yuzhi mimicked Zhang Chunqiu’s tone and said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“I never expected Zhang Chunqiu to think so highly of me.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p>“Stay here and wait for me. I’ll go in with Zhou Wen.” Zhang Yuzhi got Zhang Xiao and the White Crane team to stay outside the ancient city’s entrance as she pulled Zhou Wen into the ancient city.</p>
<p>The interior of the ancient city had already expanded to an extremely large scale. There were pavilions and buildings and large palaces. It looked like a huge ancient capital that was completely different from the original small city.</p>
<p>Even someone like Zhou Wen, who had been born here, couldn’t recognize this place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the situation inside was somewhat strange. There was no sound at all in the huge ancient city. It was so quiet that one could even hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>There were many dimensional creatures in the moat outside the city, but there wasn’t a single one in the city. The silence was deafening.</p>
<p>“Is your ability really effective against all dimensional creatures? Will high-level dimensional creatures be immune to your ability?” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Yuzhi uneasily.</p>
<p>This humanoid creature was no ordinary dimensional creature. If Zhang Yuzhi’s ability was useless, wouldn’t they be sending themselves to their deaths?</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if high-level dimensional creatures are immune to my ability. However, up to now, nothing like that has happened. Even Calamity creatures are no exception.” Zhang Yuzhi was very confident in her abilities. Clearly, she had never failed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to say something when his eyes suddenly focused. He saw a figure slowly walking over from the ancient city’s middle street.</p>
<p>The figure had his head lowered. His long gray hair cascaded down, almost covering his entire face. His hands seemed to hang by his sides subconsciously. When he walked, it was as though they had snapped and were swaying with his figure.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to be walking fast and was staggering, but despite clearly walking from the end of the long street, he was almost in front of them in a few steps.</p>
<p>Has he completely lost himself? Zhou Wen stared at the humanoid creature. He couldn’t sense the nearly human-like aura from before. Now, he looked like a pure dimensional creature no matter how he looked at it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1662'>Chapter 1662 A Bug-like Ability</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen subconsciously shielded Zhang Yuzhi behind him. At the same time, he put on the Dragon King armor and borrowed the power of eight Companion Beasts, prepared to fight the humanoid creature at any time.</p>
<p>“Calm down. He won’t be our enemy,” Zhang Yuzhi said gently as she pressed her hand on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>With that said, Zhang Yuzhi walked out from behind Zhou Wen without waiting for him to say a word. She took the initiative to walk towards the humanoid monster.</p>
<p>“Are you sure it’s fine?” Zhou Wen was still somewhat worried. He had a nagging feeling that if the imperceptible ability failed, it would be equivalent to dying.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi didn’t answer as she walked towards the humanoid monster. Her aura seemed to have changed.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster had clearly lost its humanity, nor did it remember Zhou Wen. Its eyes shimmered with a sanguine glow. Even the hair hanging down in front of it couldn’t hide the ferocious glint in its eyes, as though it could devour anyone at any moment.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy fluctuations from his body weren’t weaker than the Companion Beast killed by the suona. Zhou Wen still felt that it was too dangerous. He secretly summoned Demonic Neonate and made her prepare to attack at any time.</p>
<p>Although Demonic Neonate was only at the Terror grade, her combat strength wasn’t inferior to the top Heaven-level creatures, especially the suona she had just snatched. To be able to kill a Heaven-level creature by blowing the suona was no ordinary feat. “Come to my side.” Faced with such a terrifying creature, Zhang Yuzhi spread out her arms as though she was welcoming an old friend she hadn’t seen in a long time. It made Zhou Wen break out into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>If Zhang Yuzhi got too close to the humanoid creature and something happened, Zhou Wen might not be able to rescue her.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about stopping Zhang Yuzhi, the humanoid creature had already walked in front of her. Zhang Yuzhi rushed over and hugged the humanoid creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s scalp tingled as he nervously looked at the humanoid creature with a ferocious glint in its eyes. He almost couldn’t help but attack.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he held back in the end. The humanoid creature was hugged by Zhang Yuzhi and didn’t attack her. The ferocious glint in his eyes was revealed when he looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’m here…” Zhang Yuzhi placated the humanoid monster.</p>
<p>The powerful and terrifying humanoid creature gradually turned gentle and stopped showing its ferocious appearance.</p>
<p>Seeing the humanoid creature slowly relax and quieten down, Zhang Yuzhi released her grip on him and stroked his hair with one hand.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have believed that there was such an unbelievable power in the world. Such a powerful and terrifying dimensional creature was like a child as it rubbed its head and face against Zhang Yuzhi’s palm.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder the Zhang family has always treated Zhang Yuzhi as a god, afraid that something would happen to her. Such an ability is like a bug in games. The Zhang family has used Zhang Yuzhi all these years and killed countless high-level dimensional creatures. Their wealth must be much richer than I imagined, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he never thought of using Zhang Yuzhi’s powers to kill dimensional creatures. That would be too cruel for Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know what Zhang Yuzhi’s ability was, Zhou Wen could tell that it wasn’t just a skill. Zhang Yuzhi had also thrown in her true feelings and even unconditional trust, treating dimensional creatures as existences that could live and die together with her.</p>
<p>Such commitment might be the foundation of Zhang Yuzhi’s ability.</p>
<p>Under Zhang Yuzhi’s placation, the humanoid creature had become much more docile. However, when it looked at Zhou Wen, it still revealed a ferocious look from time to time, looking feral.</p>
<p>“Don’t approach him for the time being. I need to spend more time with him. After some time, he won’t be as afraid of strangers as he is now,” Zhang Yuzhi said to Zhou Wen as she placated the humanoid creature.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at the humanoid creature and said, “Can you communicate with him? Can you ask him some questions?”</p>
<p>The last time the humanoid creature spoke to him, it was done in a vague manner, Zhou Wen wanted to know what the three conditions the humanoid creature mentioned were.</p>
<p>“Sure, but it will take some time. I haven’t completely gained his trust,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“You still haven’t gained his complete trust even like that?” Zhou Wen saw that Zhang Yuzhi could already touch the humanoid monster’s head. If she wanted to harm the humanoid creature, she could attack his vital spots at any time. “It’s not that simple. His willpower is very strong. I reckon it will take at least half a month to completely make him trust me. When the time comes, you can ask whatever you want,” Zhang Yuzhi said.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. I’ll look around the city to see if there are any other dimensional creatures. I also want to see if this place is really suitable for human habitation.” Since Zhang Yuzhi was building her relationship with the humanoid creature. It was useless for Zhou Wen to stay here, so he decided to tour the ancient city.</p>
<p>The space inside the ancient city had expanded tremendously. There were palatial buildings everywhere. Yet, such a huge city didn’t have any dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>In the past, there were still Skeleton Soldiers and Skeleton Generals in the city, but now, there was nothing. It was an empty city. Even the interior of the buildings was empty. If nothing went wrong, this place was indeed very suitable for living. Even the houses were ready-made and in move-in condition. Zhou Wen roughly estimated that the buildings in the city were more than enough for a million people to live in. There were plenty of empty spaces in the city, so it wasn’t a bad idea to use them as farms.</p>
<p>The key was that there was a well in the ancient city. Zhou Wen tasted it and realized that the water in the well was sweet and refreshing. It could be drunk directly and was different from the water in the moat. There was no need to worry about water sources.</p>
<p>As long as the four city gates were closed from the inside, it would be difficult for the creatures outside to barge in. It was indeed a good place that was easy to defend and difficult to attack.</p>
<p>Of course, this place wasn’t completely without flaws. At present, there weren’t any dimensional creatures in the city. If he wanted to hunt dimensional creatures, he had to go out and hunt the skeletons that crawled out of the moat.</p>
<p>There weren’t any edible dimensional creatures nearby, so it wasn’t conducive for gathering meat.</p>
<p>However, these problems weren’t major problems. There were solutions. The most important thing now was to find a home for the hundreds of thousands of people to settle down. Ancient City was undoubtedly the most suitable place for the time being.</p>
<p>I ended up establishing a city here. Zhou Wen came to the Fire God Platform and looked at the stone saber embedded in the stone furnace. He didn’t know what to feel.</p>
<p>After making all kinds of turns and detours, to his surprise, he still returned to the starting point.</p>
<p>Overseer Luoyang’s residence. An Tianzuo, who was reading some documents, suddenly looked up and said, “Since you’re here, come in and have a cup of tea. Be it fighting or escaping, there’s no rush.”</p>
<p>“As expected of Overseer An.” Before the door opened, a figure passed through it.</p>
<p>The figure was a shadow. It was blurry as though a person could be seen clearly. However, no matter how carefully one looked, one couldn’t tell what he looked like.</p>
<p>“How do I address you?” An Tianzuo poured a cup of tea and pushed it in front of the figure.</p>
<p>“You can call me Spirit Slave. I came to see you, Overseer, because I hope that you can become the representative of our Spirit race in the human world…” the figure said slowly. “Why should I be your representative?” An Tianzuo drank a mouthful of tea and placed the teacup on the table before asking Spirit Slave.</p>
<p>“The Earth’s seal will soon be lifted. The dimensional descent is a foregone conclusion. The various races of the dimension are searching for representatives in the human world and will provide them with large amounts of resources. Our Spirit race will also provide you with resources,” said Spirit Slave.</p>
<p>“Then why should I choose your Spirit race and not the other races?” An Tianzuo’s expression didn’t change as he continued asking.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1663'>Chapter 1663 Representatives</h3>
<p>“The resources that the six Holy races possess are indeed much more than our Spirit race. What they can give you might also be what our Spirit race can’t give you. However, the six Holy races have been plotting on Earth for many years and have already spread the net for countless geniuses among humans. Even if they think highly of you, the resources they give you will only be a tiny fraction,” said Spirit Slave.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo sat in his chair and placed his hands on the table as he calmly looked at Spirit Slave and said, “A large race is a large race after all. Even if it’s just a fraction, it might not be less than what you can offer. Furthermore, as the saying goes, when it comes to choosing shade, it’s better to choose a big tree. If I choose your Spirit race, it’s equivalent to fighting alone. And by choosing them, not only can I obtain resources, but I can also have many helpers, right?”</p>
<p>“You’re right. However, the Holy race might not think as highly of you as we do. It’s impossible for them to have their race’s sovereign to personally meet you, much less give you pointers. This is my race’s sincerity.”</p>
<p>“The leader of your race wants to meet me?” An Tianzuo revealed a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes. Although my race hasn’t reached the position of Holy races, my race’s leader is a powerful existence that can be ranked in the top ten of the alien races.” Spirit Slave’s voice was filled with pride.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll meet your race’s leader who can be ranked in the top ten of the alien races,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>This time, Spirit Slave was the one who was slightly taken aback. He never expected An Tianzuo to agree so easily. He swallowed the words of persuasion he had prepared.</p>
<p>“Why? Can’t we meet now?” An Tianzuo said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Of course. However, with Earth’s openness, it’s still a little troublesome to enter the dimension. I can only ask you to leave Earth with me before using some means to enter the dimension…”</p>
<p>Luoyang’s Li family.</p>
<p>“Li Mobai, you don’t have to answer me immediately. You can consider it slowly.” Li Mobai sat in front of the lamp that shone his shadow on the wall. The shadow was completely different from his actions. Furthermore, it could make sounds.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Take me to your Lord of Evil Ghosts,” Li Mobai said.</p>
<p>“What a wise choice.” The shadow cackled. In the next second, the lamp was switched off and the room turned pitch-black.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Family Clan of the North District.</p>
<p>“Lance, tell me your answer.” A glorious figure floated in front of Lance. Under the immense pressure, the companions who were with Lance couldn’t withstand the terrifying pressure as they knelt on one knee. Their faces were distorted and their bodies were covered in sweat.</p>
<p>“There are so many Saints in the Divine Emperor Holy Temple. Why do you still want me? Furthermore, the ones corresponding to your Divine Emperor Holy Temple should be the Cape family, right? Why aren’t you choosing people from the Cape family? Why are you looking for me?” Lance’s entire body was trembling. His legs were about to break, but he still held on and didn’t kneel.</p>
<p>SOV</p>
<p>“There can only be one sovereign in this world. If you come, you will be the only sovereign in my race’s Holy Temple.” The figure continued, “However, everyone wants to become sovereign. If you become sovereign, you have to constantly accept challenges from everyone. If you lose, you will be reduced to nothing. If you remain undefeated, the people who want to become sovereign will constantly challenge you until you die or lose… Tell me… your choice…”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if I become sovereign or not. The key is that I like the feeling of constantly winning,” Lance said in all seriousness.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already explored Guide Ancient City thoroughly in the past few days. Apart from the lack of dimensional creatures, everything else was suitable as a human city.</p>
<p>The city was big enough. Not only was it huge, but there was also a large space inside the many buildings. The entire city’s space was many times bigger than it appeared from the outside.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was plenty of water here. There were many stone wells distributed in the city, and the underground water in the wells was endless.</p>
<p>It could be used for planting and breeding. As long as there was water, they could become self-sufficient with food.</p>
<p>The only hidden danger was the stone saber on Fire God Platform. If the stone saber was pulled out, it was unknown what changes the ancient city would undergo.</p>
<p>As for the humanoid monster, it had already been completely tamed by Zhang Yuzhi. It followed Zhang Yuzhi every moment like her bodyguard.</p>
<p>However, other than Zhang Yuzhi, he had a strong desire to attack other humans when he saw them. Luckily, with Zhang Yuzhi around, he wouldn’t really attack humans.</p>
<p>S.</p>
<p>“How is it? Have you decided? Do you want to build a city here?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen with a smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it here,” Zhou Wen answered with a nod. He had already thought it through over the past few days, so there was no need for him to hesitate.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, Zhang Yuzhi sighed. “From the looks of it, I jumped from one cage to another.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a cage. This is home,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then I want to choose the best room for this home.” Zhang Yuzhi laughed again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left the ancient city and returned to the base. Zhang Yuzhi and the Zhang family stayed in the ancient city. It wasn’t that Zhang Yuzhi didn’t wish to return with him, but she couldn’t leave. She needed to continue nurturing her relationship with the humanoid monster, hoping to restrain him as much as possible to prevent any accidents from happening during the mass migration.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yuzhi had said, if they really built a city, it would probably be difficult for her to leave in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to the base and found Li Xuan in the meeting hall. Then, he realized that Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen were all there.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, you came back at the right time. They encountered some trouble. Give them some suggestions,” Li Xuan said as he pointed at Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen imagined that something had happened to their family when he saw that they were fine.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan’s expression was solemn as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, there are dimensional races that want the two of us to become their representatives on Earth.” “Which race found you? One of the six Holy Temples?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised when he heard that. He had already learned from Wang Mingyuan that the seal on Earth was weakening. The terrifying existences in the dimension wouldn’t dare risk entering Earth themselves. They would definitely find some humans to figure out what was on Earth on their behalf.</p>
<p>Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu were the cream of the crop among humans, so it wasn’t surprising that the races of the dimension would seek them out.</p>
<p>“No, they are all races I’ve never heard of. The one that came to me is some Inter race? The one that went to Little Yanyan is some Phaseless race.” Ming Xiu paused before continuing, “They said that they will send us into the dimension to cultivate for a period of time and give us enough resources and help us advance to the Calamity grade. Coach, do you think we should go?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Ming Xiu before looking at Feng Qiuyan. He shook his head and sighed. “The answer is already in your hearts. Why bother asking?”</p>
<p>“If Coach needs me to stay, I’ll stay,” Feng Qiuyan said.</p>
<p>“I need you, but not now.” Zhou Wen patted Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s shoulders. “Just respect your conscience. However, you still have to be careful. The fellows from the dimension aren’t good people. You can take advantage of them, but be careful not to be exploited.”</p>
<p>“The base’s situation is in a terrible state now. If we leave, will the base be capable of defending?” Ming Xiu asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ve already chosen a city. There’s no need to build it. We can move over immediately,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as an airtight secret in the world. The news of the various dimensional races choosing representatives among humans quickly spread in the Federation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1664'>Chapter 1664 Mohe</h3>
<p>It was unknown if it was news released by the dimension itself, but the entire Federation soon learned that the various races of the dimension had chosen their representatives among humans.</p>
<p>They could obtain the resources of the dimensional races and enter a high-level world like the dimension to cultivate. They could obtain the pointers of dimensional experts, and he didn’t even have to sell their lives to the dimension like Saints. All they needed to do was sign a contract and help the dimensional races find something on Earth to terminate the contract.</p>
<p>Even if the contract wasn’t terminated, other than searching for such a thing, the representative could also reject the other requests of the dimension and not work for them.</p>
<p>Almost everyone was tempted by such conditions. It was more like a partnership. Without really selling one’s life to the dimension, one could obtain all sorts of benefits. Where else could one find such a good deal?</p>
<p>Everyone felt that this was a good thing, but the people who really received the invitation were watching. Very few people directly accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>Things were too good to be true, so it inevitably made people suspicious, afraid that dimensional powerhouses would tamper with the contract.</p>
<p>Although Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had already decided to head to the dimension for cultivation, they didn’t immediately head there. They still decided to wait for the people from Guide City to be evacuated into the ancient city before heading to the dimension after everything had stabilized.</p>
<p>This process went very smoothly. There were many buildings in the ancient city to begin with, so all they needed to do was draw up plans for the distribution. In this aspect, Li Xuan had found experts from the Li family, and the Zhang family was a top expert in this area. After discussion, they quickly came up with a plan. Hundreds of thousands of people methodically migrated into the ancient city.</p>
<p>The migration wasn’t difficult. The difficult part was how to form a self-sufficient supply chain in the ancient city and provide livelihoods to the residents.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Zhou Wen to provide for them for no reason. Excessive kindness could backfire, and kindness wasn’t something that could be easily given. Hundreds of thousands of people needed to pay a price for something. Otherwise, if they relied on Zhou Wen’s providence, chaos would definitely ensue in the future.</p>
<p>The quality of the hundreds of thousands of people were varied and their combat abilities were basically very low. Zhou Wen didn’t expect them to really fight. Those who could fight were given the chance to hunt dimensional creatures to exchange for supplies. Those who didn’t have combat abilities were employed in farming, livestock raising, business, education, and administrative work.</p>
<p>These complicated plans and work were basically handled by Li Xuan and the Zhang family, with the Xia family involving themselves a little. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to put his mind on this.</p>
<p>Apart from grinding dungeons daily, Zhou Wen focused more on how to advance his various Essence Energy Arts to a domain.</p>
<p>I have to advance to the true Calamity grade as soon as possible. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to make another trip to Luoyang. Firstly, he had to bring Ya’er back. Secondly, he had to make a trip to Small Buddha Temple in real life to see if he could find the opportunity for Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to advance to the Calamity grade. “The Cube has lit up again. Another person is challenging the Star Palace dimensional zone.”</p>
<p>“Eh, it’s actually a human. Furthermore, it looks a little familiar.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a famous loser from the Family Clan of Gods? The inept Mohe? Why is he challenging the Cube’s Star Palace? Does he have a death wish?”</p>
<p>“That’s not right. How did he enter? Don’t four people have to be together to open the Cube? Would the Family Clan of Gods sacrifice three lives to send Mohe up? What’s the</p>
<p>point?”</p>
<p>It was no wonder people were surprised. Mohe was quite famous in the West District and even the entire Federation.</p>
<p>Of course, it was infamy. Born in a family like the Family Clan of Gods, not only was Mohe’s talent and aptitude surprisingly poor, but he only condensed a Life Providence at the age of twenty to become a Legendary.</p>
<p>More exasperating was his Life Providence; it was extremely useless. It was called “Harming Others Without Benefiting Oneself.”</p>
<p>The useless God of Unkilling Life Providence that the Dugu family produced only meant that one couldn’t kill. Mohe was even more extreme. If Mohe were to harm others, not only would others be fine, but he would end up injured.</p>
<p>The simplest example was when Mohe slashed at someone’s neck with a saber. The person would end up fine, but Mohe would have his own head chopped off.</p>
<p>Of course, Mohe had never really tried chopping off the heads of others. When he went to hunt dimensional creatures, he suffered a backlash.</p>
<p>One could imagine how despairing it was for Mohe, who had finally condensed a Life Providence after twenty years of hard work and was excited to hunt dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Since then, Mohe had become a joke of the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>Although no one dared to say anything about Mohe in front of the Family Clan of Gods, in private, Mohe’s “reputation” had already spread throughout the Federation. He was famous for being a loser.</p>
<p>Now, Mohe had actually ascended the Cube and entered Dubhe Palace. It was no wonder those who knew him were surprised.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at the screen in a daze. Most people felt that Mohe’s actions were no different from suicide. Perhaps there was no need for the Calamity-grade Starlord Ravenous Wolf to do anything. Just the high temperature in the Star Palace was enough to kill Mohe.</p>
<p>Mohe stood in the Star Palace with a mocking smile. In the high temperature, a strange light rose from his body. Countless light beams intertwined, forming a black Guardian armor around him.</p>
<p>“So he contracted a Guardian. However, even if he has a Guardian, what’s the point when he has such a useless Life Providence? Ignoring the fact that his Guardian might not be able to defeat Starlord Ravenous Wolf, even if he can, would he dare kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf? Wouldn’t killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf be equivalent to killing himself?”</p>
<p>“What’s the Family Clan of Gods thinking? Isn’t getting Mohe up there killing him?” “I think the Family Clan of Gods also feels that it’s too embarrassing with this loser around. Therefore, they deliberately sent him to his death?”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, Mohe had already walked towards the Star Palace’s door. Without any hesitation, he pushed the door open and walked in.</p>
<p>As they watched Mohe approach step by step, Starlord Ravenous Wolf finally reacted. His fist bloomed like a purple sun as a terrifying glow enveloped the entire Star Palace.</p>
<p>Seeing the Star Palace devoured by the light, everyone thought that Mohe was doomed. However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The light exploded as Mohe continued walking slowly amidst the light. As for the Starlord Ravenous Wolf that attacked Mohe, its body suddenly exploded, turning into light dust that filled the sky before disappearing.</p>
<p>“How can this be?” Everyone’s mouths gaped open for a long time.</p>
<p>As for Mohe, he had already passed through the teleportation nexus and arrived at Merak Star Palace. He pushed open the Star Palace door again and faced the huge mountain-like Starlord Titan Gate.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate roared angrily as his fist struck at Mohe with supreme divine power.</p>
<p>However, Mohe continued advancing slowly. He didn’t even look up at Starlord Titan Gate as though he didn’t take his fist seriously.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate’s huge fist smashed down as though it could reduce Mohe’s tiny body to dust with one strike.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, while Mohe stood there unharmed, Starlord Titan Gate’s body exploded like a watermelon from head to toe. Everyone was dumbfounded as they watched this shocking scene in a daze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1665'>Chapter 1665 First Place Changes</h3>
<p>The average person felt that the scene in front of them was extremely shocking. Mohe had killed two Starlords without even moving his hand. He was unimaginably powerful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mohe had been infamous in the past. It made it even more unbelievable now.</p>
<p>As for some of the top humans, they roughly guessed that Mohe might have the ability to reflect damage.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be as simple as a reflection,” Li Xuan said after some thought. “The ability to reflect damage typically consumes energy during the reflection process. Therefore, the reflected power won’t exceed the user’s strength. As for Mohe, his situation is clearly different. The reflected power is even stronger than the two Starlords.”</p>
<p>Xia Xuanyue, who was also watching the battle, nodded and said, “Perhaps the reflection isn’t the power involved, but the damage itself.”</p>
<p>“That’s very likely.” Li Xuan felt that what Xia Xuanyue said made sense.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also watching the battle. He felt that Mohe’s strength was somewhat similar to Starlord Cherished Kismet’s. He thought to himself, I wonder if Mohe will continue the challenge. I wonder who’s stronger between Mohe and Starlord Cherished Kismet?</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Mohe had already walked into the teleportation star. The Cube’s screen changed and became the scene of Phecda Star Palace.</p>
<p>This is interesting. Both of them need to reflect the powers of the other. How will they fight? Zhou Wen was intrigued.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen fought Starlord Cherished Kismet, he had used the power of Human Sovereign to kill him. Otherwise, any force that struck him would ricochet.</p>
<p>If Mohe and Starlord Cherished Kismet didn’t fight and waited to reflect each other’s damage, it seemed like victory would never be decided.</p>
<p>Mohe pushed open the door of Phecda Star Palace and walked towards Starlord Cherished Kismet. His stance was no different from before, as though he didn’t take Starlord Cherished Kismet seriously.</p>
<p>“Back then, Egg Sovereign… No… Deceit King only managed to reach Phecda Star Palace with his Companion Beasts… He still hasn’t killed Starlord Cherished Kismet… If Mohe succeeds… won’t he reach first place on the rankings?”</p>
<p>“Even if he can’t kill Starlord Cherished Kismet, he has already reached the highest point that humans can reach. How did Mohe suddenly become so strong? Even if he contracted a Guardian, it’s impossible for him to become so strong all of a sudden, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Furthermore, Mohe’s Life Providence is odd. It should be impossible for him to kill his opponent. How did he easily kill two Starlords?”</p>
<p>The spectators discussed spiritedly as they guessed why Mohe had become so strong. Furthermore, they also wanted to know how Mohe could create a miracle and kill Starlord Cherished Kismet to obtain first place on the Cube’s rankings.</p>
<p>Mohe walked towards Starlord Cherished Kismet step by step. Everyone’s gazes followed his figure.</p>
<p>Starlord Cherished Kismet sat there without any intention of getting up.</p>
<p>If they don’t attack, it will be a hopeless situation. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw Mohe attack first and punch Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. This outcome was somewhat unexpected. Although he didn’t know what kind of power Mohe’s Guardian had, if his Life Providence hadn’t changed and he took the initiative to kill, the wound would still appear on him.</p>
<p>Could it be that even Mohe’s Life Providence has been changed? Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Mohe’s punch didn’t look strong, nor did it carry any mysterious glow. It was an ordinary straight punch that struck Starlord Cherished Kismet.</p>
<p>Starlord Cherished Kismet showed no intention of dodging. The simple and direct punch struck him.</p>
<p>After Mohe’s punch landed, Starlord Cherished Kismet remained unharmed. His body didn’t even shake, but Mohe had already retracted his fist.</p>
<p>“Mohe’s Guardian is indeed the type that reflects damage. It’s just that the damage reflection is powerful. If he’s the one attacking his opponent, his strength will be much weaker.”</p>
<p>Many experts who had already guessed Mohe’s powers revealed an expression that it was as expected.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes. The seemingly unharmed Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body suddenly turned to dust as the wind scattered it.</p>
<p>Silence! Dead silence!</p>
<p>No one expected such an outcome. Everyone, including Zhou Wen, looked at the Cube’s screen in surprise. The Mohe in the dust that filled the sky was like a devil enveloped in fog, making one find him extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Even the experts of the various families were shocked. They originally imagined that Mohe’s Guardian could only reflect damage, but they never expected him to instantly kill a Calamity-grade Starlord with a single punch. He was unimaginably powerful.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t stop as he walked straight towards the teleportation nexus. As people guessed inwardly, looking forward to seeing how many Star Palaces Mohe could clear, they realized that the scene had switched back to the Cube’s ranking. Clearly, Mohe didn’t continue challenging.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the Cube’s ranking. If nothing went wrong, Mohe’s name should have appeared there.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first place had changed, but the first place wasn’t named Mohe.</p>
<p>Fallen race’s representative. Many people silently recited the name that was ranked first.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was enlightened. They were momentarily surprised, but they felt that it was only right.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder a trash like Mohe would suddenly become so strong. He has become the representative of a dimensional race.”</p>
<p>“A piece of trash can become so strong after becoming a representative. What if I become a representative?”</p>
<p>“What kind of race is the Fallen race? I’ve never heard of it before. It’s definitely not one of the six Holy races. Even a nameless race can nurture such a powerful representative. If one becomes the representatives of the six Holy races, how many benefits will they obtain? How powerful will they be?”</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was pondering over something</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, many human geniuses will become representatives of the dimension after today,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>It was indeed as Li Xuan had said. After today’s battle, everyone was talking about Mohe and about representatives. It was as though everyone was extremely interested in becoming a dimensional representative overnight.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who weren’t qualified to become representatives were secretly looking forward to the dimension seeking them out and turning them into experts like Mohe.</p>
<p>After all, even a person like Mohe, who was known as trash, could become so strong. They felt that they weren’t inferior to Mohe no matter what. If Mohe could do it, why couldn’t they?</p>
<p>Some humans who had received invitations from the dimensional races were embarrassed to let others know that they had received an invitation, but now, many people took the initiative to announce the invitations they received. It was as though receiving a representative invitation had become a very honorable matter.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1666'>Chapter 1666 A New Era</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay special attention to the so-called representatives. Earth was already close to a full-scale breakout. There wasn’t much time left for him, so he didn’t have the time to pay attention to such trivial matters.</p>
<p>In an ancient building in Ancient Sovereign City, Zhou Wen held the mysterious phone as his eyes widened. His eyes were about to pop out as beads of sweat constantly seeped out of his forehead and dripped down his cheeks.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate, Banana Fairy, and the other Companion Beasts looked at Zhou Wen curiously as though they were watching a rare animal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their fault for being curious. Zhou Wen had maintained this pose for seventeen to eighteen hours. Apart from his fingers occasionally moving, he was like a wooden statue.</p>
<p>In-game, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter Small Buddha Temple’s game dungeon again. In the past ten hours, he had repeated this action countless times.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra came from Small Buddha Temple, so Zhou Wen originally wanted to see if he could condense a domain in Small Buddha Temple to advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s control, the game screen quickly turned black every time the blood-colored avatar entered the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen never expected that the game dungeon, Small Buddha Temple, he had downloaded a long time ago would be so terrifying.</p>
<p>The three-faced Buddha who had once taken out three Companion Eggs for him to choose was even more terrifying than any Calamity-grade creature Zhou Wen had previously encountered.</p>
<p>Instant kill-an instant kill that left no room for negotiation. As long as Zhou Wen didn’t use the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra from the beginning and used other Essence Energy Arts to enter the temple, the blood-colored avatar would immediately die the moment the three-faced Buddha opened his six eyes.</p>
<p>Even if he used the Chaos Egg that had already reached the Calamity grade, it could only last for an instant before the Calamity-grade Chaos Egg exploded.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was almost certain that the three-faced Buddha was at least at the top of the Calamity grade—the Heaven level. However, this was only a guess. Zhou Wen believed that the three-faced Buddha might be at the even more terrifying Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>In front of the three-faced Buddha, the stronger Zhou Wen was, the stronger the three-faced Buddha became. He didn’t even have the chance to pull out the Immortal Culling Sword. However, even if he pulled it out and slashed out, it would probably be useless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nearly tried all the methods he could, but he was still instantly killed.</p>
<p>Faced with such a terrifying three-faced Buddha, Zhou Wen had already given up on the thought of using this place to advance the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to the Calamity grade. The reason he kept throwing himself to his death was that he realized that every time the Chaos Egg exploded, it would grow at an astonishing speed. In less than a day, it was about to touch the threshold of the Hell level under the continuous ravages of the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>In the past month, Zhou Wen hadn’t left his room much. Guide Ancient City was also silently undergoing changes. However, this change was like the spring sun melting snow. It was done silently, making it stand out from the tumultuous changes in the outside world.</p>
<p>More and more alien representatives appeared on Earth. Almost every alien representative displayed their strength on the Cube’s screen through the Big Dipper dimensional zone.</p>
<p>ne</p>
<p>After Mohe’s attempt, one alien representative after another attempted the Big Dipper dimensional zones and appeared on the Cube’s rankings. The Cube’s first place constantly changed. The top ten rankings often changed, and the competition was abnormally intense.</p>
<p>Many new experts were known by everyone. The rankings of the experts who had entered the rankings in the past were gradually pushed to the back. The strength of the veteran experts was gradually questioned.</p>
<p>The top ten spots on the rankings were nearly all occupied by the representatives of the various races. Now, everyone was discussing the strength of the representatives. Occasionally, when they mentioned the veteran experts, they were mostly discussing how far humans could go without the help of the alien races.</p>
<p>Although there were some people who firmly believed that powerhouses like Human Sovereign could fight the representatives of the alien races even if they didn’t become representatives, most of the time, many people were more willing to dream of being chosen by an alien race one day and becoming their representative. They would become powerful in a short period of time and become famous on the Cube’s rankings.</p>
<p>However, there was no free lunch. Most of the people who could become representatives of the alien races were genius experts who stood at the apex of the human pyramid to begin with. Even the originally unknown representatives were chosen because their potential hadn’t been developed before becoming representatives.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t anxious when he saw the representatives appear on the rankings, but someone else was.</p>
<p>“Honn Shinsakura, have you gone mad?” Inside the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, an old man pointed at Honn Shinsakura. His fingers were trembling terribly as his face flushed red. The muscles on his face trembled. Clearly, he was extremely agitated.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura was no longer the tender youth who had followed Sei Gasakai to Luoyang to cultivate. His face no longer had the innocence and impetuousness of a youth. The mature man’s unique steady temperament and firm eyes, as well as his angular facial features, made him look like a lone island. He didn’t stir even when the waves crashed into him.</p>
<p>“I’m not mad,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly as he sat cross-legged on the mat with his swords placed flat on his lap.</p>
<p>“Not mad? Then you must be out of your mind. Wake up. Your choice determines the lives and future of more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. Instead of going to the six families, you actually want to go to Guide Ancient City? Do you know what’s going on outside? It’s the era of representatives. Even the Zhang family and the Dugu family, who have always been determined to fight the alien races, have already accepted the existence of representatives. They are trying their best to make their members representatives. What does Guide Ancient City have? I can tell you with certainty that there’s no representative there. You ignored the six families’ generous offers and insisted on going to Guide Ancient City. If that’s not madness, what is?” The elder became angrier as he spoke, eager to slap Honn Shinsakura awake.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s there,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly without any change in expression.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen? No matter how strong Zhou Wen is, he’s not a representative. What future can he have? Ignoring Zhou Wen’s Guide Ancient City, even the Luoyang An family he relies on hasn’t produced a representative yet. Sooner or later, they will be annexed by others. When that happens, we won’t even have the right to negotiate with the six families. We might even end up as cannon fodder. You are joking with the lives of more than ten thousand disciples of my Niten Flying Immortal Palace. I definitely disagree, and the various Elders definitely disagree.” When the elder said that, the few Elders standing beside him nodded silently, expressing their support for the elder’s opinion.</p>
<p>As the anomalies in the dimensional zones overseas became more and more serious, it was difficult for ordinary cultivators to survive at sea. The Niten Flying Immortal Palace had reached the point of having no choice but to consider returning to the continent. Otherwise, it would probably lead to a calamity in the near future.</p>
<p>However, on the question of where to go after returning to the continent, the current palace master of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, Honn Shinsakura, and the Elder Consortium had a sharp disagreement.</p>
<p>The six families had previously come into contact with the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and expressed their willingness to take them in. They also offered rather good conditions. The few Elders were inclined to make a choice among the six families, but the present Palace Lord, Honn Shinsakura, insisted on heading to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1667'>Chapter 1667 Why Not?</h3>
<p>“It’s my decision to head to Guide Ancient City. It’s also an order. It’s not a discussion,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly.</p>
<p>His tone was extremely calm, but it was as though he ignited gasoline. It wasn’t just the elder who had argued with Honn Shinsakura. The other Elders also revealed looks of indignation. All of them opened their mouths. Some cursed angrily, while others tried to persuade him nicely. There were even some who criticized Honn Shinsakura in their capacities as his elders. Their words implied that they didn’t want Honn Shinsakura to be stubborn. Otherwise, he would definitely harm more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. It was even possible that he would destroy the foundation Sei Gasakai had painstakingly built.</p>
<p>Seeing the Elders saying all kinds of words, Honn Shinsakura was about to say something when he suddenly saw a white-robed female swordsman walk in. He closed his mouth and looked at the female swordsman.</p>
<p>“Elders, would you mind listening to me?” the female swordsman asked the Elders.</p>
<p>“Shiraishi Satomi, you came just in time. Quick, come and persuade your senior brother. He wants to destroy the foundation that the Sword Sage has painstakingly built…” When the elders saw the female swordsman, their eyes immediately lit up. They invited her to join their camp to make a collective bid to persuade Honn Shinsakura otherwise.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai had many disciples, but the only ones who could obtain his true teachings were Honn Shinsakura and Shiraishi Satomi. Although Honn Shinsakura had inherited the position of Palace Lord, Shiraishi Satomi’s status in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was still very high. Her relationship with Honn Shinsakura was relatively good, so Honn Shinsakura would likely consider her words seriously.</p>
<p>“Elders, the Palace Lord’s decision is right. We should head to Guide Ancient City and not the six families.” Shiraishi Satomi’s words left the Elders dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Shiraishi Satomi, why are you going crazy with the Palace Lord?” The Elders looked at Shiraishi Satomi in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’m not crazy, much less the Palace Lord. Guide Ancient City is our best choice, not the six families,” Shiraishi Satomi said firmly.</p>
<p>“Why?” The Elders were even more puzzled. They really couldn’t think of any reason to choose the tiny Guide Ancient City under the An family instead of the six families.</p>
<p>“Because Zhou Wen’s there.” When she said that, Shiraishi Satomi’s eyes seemed to twinkle.</p>
<p>The Elders were stunned. This was the second time they had heard this today. Honn Shinsakura had first given this answer, and now, Shiraishi Satomi had given the same answer. It was unbelievable that the two cornerstones of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace had given such an answer.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is indeed someone remarkable. There are also rumors in the outside world that he’s Deceit King. Ignoring the fact that he might not be Deceit King, even if he really is, the fact that he hasn’t been chosen by the dimension only proves that his potential is limited. It’s not worth us betting the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace on him…” an Elder persuaded.</p>
<p>“Third Elder is right. Besides, what kind of place is Guide Ancient City? There are strange dimensional zones everywhere, and the environment is not much better than at sea. It’s even more terrifying. In the future, the dimensional zones will break out on a large scale, and the situation might be even worse than at sea. Wouldn’t joining them be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire?”</p>
<p>“Definitely not. Even if we are considering going to Guide Ancient City, we should directly contact Luoyang’s An family. Isn’t going to Guide Ancient City lowering our status?”</p>
<p>“Guide Ancient City is definitely not a good place…”</p>
<p>The Elders began persuading Shiraishi Satomi again. No matter how good Shiraishi Satomi and Honn Shinsakura’s relationship with Zhou Wen was, they didn’t believe that it was a place worth staking the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>“What if Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign?” Shiraishi Satomi suddenly said.</p>
<p>The Elders who kept talking immediately fell silent as they stared at Shiraishi Satomi as though they had frozen. They even forgot to close their mouths.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” An Elder felt that he had definitely heard wrongly and asked Shiraishi Satomi.</p>
<p>“If Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign, is he worth entrusting?” Shiraishi Satomi asked. “Shiraishi Satomi, don’t spout nonsense just to convince us. Back when Human Sovereign killed Di Tian, Zhou Wen wasn’t even twenty years old. He was just a kid. How could he be Human Sovereign?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, that’s right. Zhou Wen is definitely not Human Sovereign. Don’t think that you can fool us and get us to agree to go to Guide Ancient City.”</p>
<p>“Even if Zhou Wen is really Human Sovereign, he hasn’t been chosen by the dimension. It’s unknown if he can still fight representatives. Furthermore, he will be outnumbered…”</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi was taken aback. She originally imagined that as long as she informed the Elders that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, she would definitely gain their support. She never expected such an outcome.</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi was momentarily at a loss for words as she looked at Honn Shinsakura with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura had long expected such an outcome, so he hadn’t revealed the secret of Zhou Wen being Human Sovereign. Firstly, it was useless, and secondly, it could easily cause Zhou Wen trouble.</p>
<p>Seeing Shiraishi Satomi’s pleading gaze, Honn Shinsakura slowly said, “Elders, do you know why the Sword Dao my master created is called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū? Why is our place called the Niten Flying Immortal Palace?”</p>
<p>“The Sword Sage said that he received pointers from an expert, so he was able to create the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. As for why it’s called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, he didn’t say anything…” an Elder said after some thought.</p>
<p>The Niten Flying Immortal Palace didn’t discriminate. Most of the disciples were actually recruited from other factions. There weren’t many disciples personally taught by Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the harsh living conditions overseas, many small factions had joined the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to obtain Sei Gasakai’s protection.</p>
<p>Most of these Elders used to be rulers of a region, not fellow disciples of Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>“You are right. Master created the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū thanks to the pointers of an expert. Back then, I was only a teenager. I followed Master to the mainland to cultivate and met a peerless expert in Luoyang’s peony garden,” Honn Shinsakura said.</p>
<p>“I know about this. Before the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was established, Lord Sword Sage traveled to the mainland. Back then, Lord Sword Sage had already reached a Sword Dao bottleneck and was just short of creating the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū.Because he encountered that expert and was defeated by him, he gained some insight. After returning, he created the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Palace Master, you should be referring to that time, right?” a jaundiced Elder recalled.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura nodded slightly. “That’s right. Do you know who the person I met with Master was?”</p>
<p>“Naturally, he’s a highly-respected senior expert,” said the jaundiced Elder.</p>
<p>“What if I say that the person we met was only a youth who was about the same age as me and was only fifteen or sixteen years old?” Honn Shinsakura swept his gaze across everyone’s faces and enunciated each word clearly.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” the Elders shouted in unison. They naturally refused to believe that such a thing would happen.</p>
<p>A fifteen-year-old youth had defeated Sei Gasakai, who was nearly a Sword Sage back then. This was simply a fantasy.</p>
<p>“Why not?” A voice sounded from outside. Everyone was overjoyed when they heard it. They looked outside and saw Sei Gasakai slowly walking over.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1668'>Chapter 1668 Not Enough to Eat</h3>
<p>“Lord Sword Sage… Master…”</p>
<p>The group of Elders, Honn Shinsakura, Shiraishi Satomi, and company stood up and bowed. Although Sei Gasakai had already handed over the position of Palace Master of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to Honn Shinsakura, just the words ‘Sei Gasakai’ alone held extremely high prestige in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and even the entire sea.</p>
<p>“Lord Sword Sage… You have to interfere in this matter… We can’t watch Palace Lord take the Niten Flying Immortal Palace down a path of no return because of his selfishness…” The Elders hurriedly explained to Sei Gasakai, who had just returned, Honn Shinsakura’s determination to take the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai waved his hand and stopped the Elders from continuing. Then, he said, “Sakura is the Palace Lord of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. He has the right to make any decision.”</p>
<p>“But…” The Elders were anxious. They wanted to argue, but they were stopped by Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai looked at the Elders and said indifferently, “Furthermore, I also think that Sakura’s decision is very correct. It’s far more correct to join Guide Ancient City than the six families.”</p>
<p>The Elders didn’t expect Sei Gasakai to say that. They were stunned and lost for words.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai continued, “Just as Sakura said, when we traveled in Luoyang, I was filled with ambition. I thought that my Sword Dao was enough to challenge Sunset College’s Leng Zongzheng, but not long after I arrived in Luoyang, I met Zhou Wen. Back then, Zhou Wen was only fifteen or sixteen years old, but I lost to him. The reason the Sword Dao I created is called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is due to the insights I gained from Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. It can be said that Zhou Wen is my master.”</p>
<p>If these Elders had doubted Honn Shinsakura’s words, they no longer had any doubts after hearing it from Sei Gasakai’s mouth. All of them were at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s talent is unparalleled despite being a pure human. He’s definitely not someone who relies on external forces to raise his strength in a short period of time. He will definitely shock the world one day. Furthermore, there are many people who have pledged allegiance to the six families. If we go now, we will only be one of them. Guide Ancient City is at a time when people are needed. It’s a good opportunity to go now. Everything that Sakura has in mind is what our Niten Flying Immortal Palace has in mind too. There is no selfishness in this. Don’t be suspicious.” Sei Gasakai swept his gaze across the faces of the Elders. They couldn’t help but lower their heads.</p>
<p>“We shall abide by the Palace Lord’s orders.” The Elders turned around and bowed at Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura’s expression remained unchanged without any ripples in his eyes. He didn’t take the matter to heart. His gaze was distant, as though his focus was no longer in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, I’m coming. My sword will surprise you. Don’t disappoint me!</p>
<p>“Ah-choo!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was gaming on his phone, sneezed. After rubbing his nose, he continued focusing on the game.</p>
<p>In the game, the blood-colored avatar’s entire body was enveloped by the Chaos Egg that resembled crystal or jade. As for the golden light that shot out from the three-faced Buddha’s eyes in the temple hall, it enveloped the Chaos Egg. The golden light seeped into the Chaos Egg and dyed it golden.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg had already reached the peak of the Hell level and was about to break through to the Heaven level.</p>
<p>A Human Realm Chaos Egg could convert the enemy’s strength into Essence Energy Crystals when suffering a beating. Furthermore, Essence Energy Crystals could be stacked to a maximum of 10,000 Essence Crystals.</p>
<p>The Chaos Egg’s stacking ability increased significantly at the Hell level. The highest he could stack reached a hundred million.</p>
<p>With the Chaos Egg’s ability to accommodate Essence Energy, it could only last for about ten seconds under the three-faced Buddha’s golden light. Furthermore, no matter how the Chaos Egg was destroyed, it couldn’t grow like before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen clearly felt that the Chaos Egg was just short of breaking through to the Heaven level, but for some reason, it was always lacking something. It was ultimately difficult for it to truly enter the Heaven level.</p>
<p>What’s missing? Seeing the game screen go black again with nothing for him and the Chaos Egg to speak for, he couldn’t help but frown in thought.</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew very well that it was impossible for him to help the Chaos Egg advance to the Heaven level with just mechanical suicidal cultivation. He had to figure out the key to advancing.</p>
<p>“I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Demonic Neonate walked to Zhou Wen’s side with the Demonic Sword in her arms. She looked up into Zhou Wen’s eyes and spoke with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Hungry?” Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he sized up Demonic Neonate in surprise.</p>
<p>Many Companion Beasts became hungry. If they were starved for too long, they might even dissipate. The most typical representative was Tyrant Behemoth. If there was no food for a long period of time, Tyrant Behemoth might starve to death.</p>
<p>It was only because Zhou Wen had the resources from the in-game dungeons and an Essence Energy Art like the Chaos Egg that he could raise so many high-level Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person, most of them would starve to death even if they were given a pile of divine pets.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate was different. She was very picky. There was little food that she fancied. Even high-level Essence Crystals were beneath her. Even a Calamity-grade Companion Egg was nothing to her.</p>
<p>It could be said that Demonic Neonate was the one who ate the least among Zhou Wen’s top Companion Beasts. Every time she ate, she would eat something strange. She usually didn’t eat, nor had he heard her mention her hunger.</p>
<p>Now, Demonic Neonate had taken the initiative to say that she was hungry. This gave Zhou Wen a fright because he didn’t know if he had anything she wanted to eat.</p>
<p>After carefully sizing her up, Demonic Neonate still looked the same. She was like an adorable and cold magical sword girl. She wasn’t much different from usual, but Zhou Wen carefully observed her for a while and realized that there was indeed something different about her.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s irises usually looked black, but in fact, they weren’t black. They were an extremely deep purple color, so deep that one would mistake them for black.</p>
<p>However, Demonic Neonate’s irises had lightened in color, turning into a grayish-purple color. The grayish-purple color gave off a degenerate and lonely feeling, as though one would be sucked in if one looked at it for too long.</p>
<p>“Neonate, what do you want to eat?” Zhou Wen took out his high-level Companion Eggs, Essence Energy Crystals, and some essences he had gathered and placed them on the bed for Demonic Neonate to choose.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate’s gaze swept across the items, but she only shook her head slightly. Zhou Wen took out many more items, but they were also rejected by Demonic Neonate.</p>
<p>Could it be that I can only use Neonate’s reserves? Zhou Wen rummaged through his belongings and didn’t find anything that Demonic Neonate wanted to eat. He couldn’t help but think of Grim Demon.</p>
<p>When Demonic Neonate saw Zhou Wen’s eyes fixated on her Demonic Sword, she immediately understood what he was thinking. She shook her head and said, “Not enough.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, unless the Demonic Sword was unsheathed, Grim Demon couldn’t sense the situation outside. Otherwise, he would probably fight Zhou Wen to the death.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1669'>Chapter 1669: The Strange Ancient Well !</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>My dear lady, you aren’t eating this or that. If you are so picky, you will starve to death sooner or later. Zhou Wen was depressed, but he didn’t verbalize it as he racked his brains.</p>
<p>“Neonate, do you have anything you want to eat?” Zhou Wen squatted in front of Demonic Neonate and asked as he stroked her head.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate thought for a moment before turning to leave. Zhou Wen hurriedly followed. He hadn’t gone out for days, so he found the sunlight a little blinding when he walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lived in a courtyard house in the north-west corner of the ancient city. Such courtyard houses were everywhere in Guide Ancient City and weren’t very eye-catching. In fact, there were many bigger courtyard houses.</p>
<p>As the owner of the ancient city, Zhou Wen could have chosen a better place. The reason he didn’t do so was that this inconspicuous courtyard house actually had something strange.</p>
<p>Every building in the ancient city was almost an independent space. Zhou Wen had already explored most of the buildings, but he had yet to find a way to enter a few places.</p>
<p>For example, he had yet to find a way to enter the Town God’s Temple, a bell tower, and some strange courtyards. Although he could enter this small courtyard, there were some bizarre things that Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he was staying here to explore the secret of the yard, but on the other hand, he was afraid that something would happen here. If anything really happened, he could suppress it in time.</p>
<p>The yard wasn’t big, and the buildings themselves weren’t too special. However, there was a well in the yard. On special days, one could hear the churning sound of spring water coming from it.</p>
<p>It sounded normal for there to be such sounds in a well. It wasn’t strange at all for wells with fresh water and underground springs.</p>
<p>In fact, even if a dimensional creature in the well made a sound, it wouldn’t be strange.</p>
<p>The strange thing was that there was no water in the well. It was a well without water, but one would often hear water splashing in the middle of the night. This was somewhat strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had once sent Companion Beasts to explore, but he didn’t discover anything. The ancient well wasn’t deep to begin with, so Zhou Wen could see the bottom at a glance. The bottom was covered in aged soil without any humidity, much less water.</p>
<p>Every time there was the sound of water, Zhou Wen would look down from the well, but the outcome was the same. He could only see the mud at the bottom of the well with no signs of water.</p>
<p>However, the sound of water flowing like a fountain clearly reached his ears. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone could hear it as long as they entered the yard.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had once dug the bottom of the well, but no matter how deep he dug, he didn’t discover anything. Furthermore, the soil he dug out would vanish after some time. The hole that was dug out would return to its original state as though it had never been moved.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen be at ease with such a strange ancient well in such a residence? He could only stay here himself. If anything happened, he could deal with it in time.</p>
<p>However, for such a long period of time, although the ancient well often produced water sounds in the middle of the night, there were no other abnormalities. Therefore, Zhou Wen hadn’t deliberately studied the ancient well recently.</p>
<p>After Demonic Neonate came out of the room, she came to the side of the ancient well and jumped onto the edge. She craned her neck and looked into the ancient well.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Demonic Neonate looked up at Zhou Wen. She pointed the Demonic Sword into the ancient well with one hand and said, “Down there.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing under this ancient well. I dug more than a thousand meters deep, but I didn’t see anything,” Zhou Wen said as he came to the ancient well and looked inside. He knew that Demonic Neonate wouldn’t do so for no reason.</p>
<p>Just like before, he could see the bottom of the well at a glance. There was nothing below.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate lowered her head and looked into the well. After a while, she suddenly said, “The thing is down there.’</p>
<p>“Where is it?” Zhou Wen focused his gaze and even summoned Doctor Darkness to fuse with him. He used his Eyes of Penetration to look down, but he still didn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate frowned in thought as though she didn’t know how to explain. After a moment of silence, she suddenly reached out and plucked the suona at her waist.</p>
<p>Typical Companion Beasts didn’t use weapons. Even if some Companion Beasts did, they were companion weapons that they came with. However, Demonic Neonate was different. The tools on her body were basically snatched from others.</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword, the Heaven Shrouding Bell, and the suona were all snatched from someone. However, other than the Demonic Sword, Demonic Neonate seldom used the Heaven Shrouding Bell and the suona.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate placed the suona in front of her mouth. Her cheeks swelled up as she tried to blow the suona.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” Zhou Wen jumped in fright as he hurriedly reached out to hug Demonic Neonate. His other hand covered her mouth, preventing her from blowing out.</p>
<p>The suona sounded like funeral music. Zhou Wen could withstand the power of</p>
<p>the suona, but ordinary people in Guide Ancient City probably couldn’t.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be good if the entire city cried.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen covered Demonic Neonate’s mouth, preventing her from releasing her breath. Her cheeks swelled as her eyes widened.</p>
<p>He reached out to pull away the hand that covered his mouth. Demonic Neonate exhaled and stared at Zhou Wen. “Without blowing… The thing below won’t come out…”</p>
<p>“What’s down there?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t tell what was down there. He was really curious as he stared into Demonic Neonate’s eyes and asked.</p>
<p>“Food,” Demonic Neonate answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“What kind of food?” Zhou Wen nearly vomited blood as he continued asking patiently.</p>
<p>“Don’t know. It’s food,” Demonic Neonate answered very quickly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was depressed, but he knew that he couldn’t get any answers from her. He pointed at the suona Demonic Neonate was holding and said, “You can blow this thing, but is there any way to prevent its sound from affecting the others in the city?”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate tilted her head and thought for a while before nodding. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and released Demonic Neonate. “Go ahead. I happen to want to know what’s inside this ancient well.”</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate placed the suona by her lips again and puffed up her cheeks to blow.</p>
<p>The loud music was earth-shattering. It penetrated deep into one’s soul as though it wanted to rob a person of their soul.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s legs went limp as he knelt on the ground. His tears in his eyes were like pearls as they fell one after another.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, didn’t you say that it won’t affect the others?” Zhou Wen’s words turned into sobbing as he struggled to stand up, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“There’s no one else here.” Demonic Neonate’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s mind as she continued playing the suona.</p>
<p>The demonic, desolate voice constantly entered Zhou Wen’s ears, causing his tears to constantly fall. He had never cried so much ever since he grew up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was about to say something when he heard the sound of flowing water from the ancient well.</p>
<p>The sound of water in the ancient well usually sounded at night. This was the first time it had appeared in broad daylight..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1670'>Chapter 1670 The Object in the Well</h3>
<p>Demonic Neonate puffed up her cheeks and blew the suona with all her might. Her face flushed red as beads of sweat appeared on her forehead. The sound of water in the ancient well kept sounding like an inferno. However, other than that, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cried terribly by the side. His tears flowed like a stream non-stop. His eyes were bloodshot as he cried until tears of blood nearly came out.</p>
<p>What a scam. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have stayed in this yard. I was still too careless. Zhou Wen felt depressed. If he had known this would happen, he would have at least made some preparations.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally relied on the Sigh of the King to prevent himself from kneeling. It had a natural restraining effect on the suona’s sound, but to his surprise, there was no reaction from the Sigh of the King. It caught him off guard. It was too late to resist after he was hit.</p>
<p>He pressed his hands on the ground and tried his best to prevent his head from touching the ground. Zhou Wen cried as blood seeped out of the corners of his eyes. However, the ancient well continued making loud noises without anything substantial happeningnothing came out.</p>
<p>“Neonate, why don’t we try again another day!” Zhou Wen cried as he shouted at Demonic Neonate. He really couldn’t hold on any longer and his forehead was about to touch the ground.</p>
<p>At that moment, the ancient well suddenly lit up. It was as though the mouth of the well had turned into a huge searchlight. Light spewed out from the well and rose several meters high before scattering like a fountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly held his breath and focused as he circulated all his strength to resist the sound. At the same time, he used Truth Listener’s ability to observe the anomalous ancient well.</p>
<p>The water in the ancient well surged out in waves. Soon, Zhou Wen realized that something was slowly floating out of the rising fountain-like light.</p>
<p>That’s… a skeleton… Zhou Wen was alarmed to discover a skull floating out of the light before a skeleton in tattered clothes appeared.</p>
<p>Soon, a complete skeleton floated above the fountain-like light.</p>
<p>The skeleton maintained a lotus position. Its body was covered in tattered clothes, and its muscles had long rotted. However, a head of white hair still grew on the skull.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, hair grew on the scalp. The skeleton’s scalp was long gone. Even if the hair didn’t decay, it should have fallen off. However, the white hair on the skull was silver-white and didn’t show any signs of withering or falling off.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was a necklace around the skeleton’s neck that was very eye-catching. It was a necklace made of black metal. The pendant was partially shaped like a Devil’s Eye, and in the middle was a purple circular crystal.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was using Truth Listener to listen to the scene, for some reason, he felt as though the Devil’s Eye was staring at him and sizing him up.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the skeleton’s left hand was still clenched tightly. Through the gaps in the fingers, one could see something being held, but most of it was blocked by the skeletal hand. It was impossible to tell what it was. All he could see was a small white object through the gaps.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was sizing it up, the suona suddenly stopped. Demonic Neonate’s figure flashed as she arrived in front of the skeleton. The sheathed Demonic Sword in her hand stabbed at the Devil’s Eye Necklace around the skeleton’s neck. The tip of the sword pointed straight at the purple pupil crystal.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The Demonic Sword collided with the pendant, producing a crisp sound. The purple crystal emitted a black hole-like purple light that forcefully blocked the Demonic Sword, preventing it from advancing any further.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate was already exhausted from playing the suona. At that moment, she unleashed all her strength as her body trembled slightly from overexertion. She gritted her teeth tightly as her fair, chubby face turned purplish-red.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was really afraid that she would use too much strength and crush her teeth. She wouldn’t be as cute without her teeth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know why he was still thinking so much at this point in time.</p>
<p>“Help me.” Only when Demonic Neonate squeezed out the words from between her teeth did he react. He immediately leaped up from the ground and summoned the Immortal Culling Sword. He held the hilt and condensed the power of Immortal Slaying. He suddenly pulled the Immortal Culling Sword out of its scabbard and slashed at the necklace around the skeleton’s neck.</p>
<p>With the power of the Immortal Culling Sword combined with Zhou Wen’s present strength, even a powerful Calamity-grade creature couldn’t ignore this strike. However, for some reason, Zhou Wen felt that this strike was likely to return empty-handed.</p>
<p>In an instant, it arrived in front of the skeleton. Just as the Immortal Culling Sword was about to hit the necklace, the necklace suddenly snapped with a crack and slid down the skeleton’s neck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback as he forcefully stopped the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand from slashing down. An indescribable palpitation surged in his heart subconsciously. It was as though something ominous would happen if he continued the strike.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had some control over the Immortal Culling Sword. If it were like before, he wouldn’t be able to restrain it even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>The blade finally stopped a few nanometers from the skeleton’s neck. As the necklace slowly slid down, the light in the ancient well dimmed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could clearly see that the necklace hadn’t really snapped. Instead, the necklace’s clasp had opened by itself, allowing it to slide down.</p>
<p>After the necklace left the skeleton’s neck, the purple light on the Devil’s Eye converged. The Demonic Sword shattered the Devil’s Eye-shaped pendant, and the purple crystal which represented the pupil dropped.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate pouted and sucked the purple crystal into her mouth before swallowing it.</p>
<p>The entire process was done in one go. Zhou Wen didn’t even have the time to size up the purple crystal.</p>
<p>The necklace that Demonic Neonate had sliced off dropped to the ground. The light in the ancient well completely converged as the skeleton fell. Its long silver hair rapidly withered and dissipated.</p>
<p>The entire skeleton’s body rapidly disintegrated, turning into ashes that scattered in all directions. The dust that fell had already vanished without a trace before it even touched the ground.</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Something fell to the ground. It was the white object that the skeleton had been holding. It was a squarish metal object that was slightly bigger than a matchbox. On one side of the metal object, there was a white line that was connected to it like a tail.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was an illusion, but he had a nagging feeling that the skeleton had released its grip when it dissipated, causing the metal object to fall.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the white object and his eyes gradually widened as though he had made an unbelievable discovery.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1671'>Chapter 1671 Charging</h3>
<p>Demonic Neonate had just swallowed the purple crystal when her grayish-purple irises darkened. In a moment, they turned dark-purple.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could carefully size her up, she automatically transformed into a dark beam of light that returned to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sensed that Demonic Neonate’s consciousness was gradually blurring. Zhou Wen had experienced this many times. It was a sign that she was about to evolve.</p>
<p>He reached out to pick up the white object on the ground and held it in his hand to stroke it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had definitely never seen it before, but its outer shell was almost identical to Zhou Wen’s mysterious phone. Be it the color or texture, there was no difference.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out the mysterious phone and wanted to compare them to see if the two materials were identical. To his surprise, just as the mysterious phone touched the white object, the white object’s string seemed to be like a magnet and stuck to the end of the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone’s screen automatically lit up, revealing a battery charging animation.</p>
<p>This… Zhou Wen was momentarily rendered speechless in surprise as he looked in the direction of the ancient well. His expression changed as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Ever since he obtained the mysterious phone, he hadn’t charged it at all. The mysterious phone didn’t need to be charged either. There wasn’t even a charging port.</p>
<p>However, this thing was actually charging. The battery icon on the screen showed that the battery was only at 1%. Zhou Wen didn’t know whether there was a difference between having the mysterious phone charged or not. This wasn’t the problem he was most concerned about.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s father had explained the origins of the phone very clearly. It was dug out by Zhou Wen’s grandfather from an ancient well in Guide Ancient City, but Zhou Wen’s father wasn’t too sure which ancient well it came from.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the object was clearly something that came with a phone. It was most likely a portable charger.</p>
<p>Could it be that the mysterious phone was dug out from this ancient well? Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he looked at the charging phone. His expression became even more complicated.</p>
<p>He thought of a possibility. If the mysterious phone was really dug out from this ancient well, could the skeleton be his grandfather’s remains?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen the strength of the necklace with his own eyes. With Demonic Neonate’s strength, it was difficult for her to injure it at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could roughly guess that his strike probably couldn’t injure the necklace, but when he approached it, the necklace automatically opened.</p>
<p>When the skeleton dissipated, it seemed to have released its grip, allowing the portable charger to fall. He also felt his heart palpitate just as he was about to slash down.</p>
<p>These abnormal developments made Zhou Wen wonder if the skeleton had done it on purpose. If the skeleton was really Zhou Wen’s grandfather’s remains, all of this could be explained.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen recalled that his grandfather hadn’t gone missing, nor had he been buried. He had been cremated when he passed away. The young Zhou Wen had even participated in the funeral, so it was unlikely that he had left his remains behind.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out no matter how hard he tried. The skeleton had already dissipated, so it was impossible to find any clues.</p>
<p>Looking at the charging phone, Zhou Wen had no choice but to wait. He wanted to see what changes would result after the phone was charged. Perhaps there would be clues when the time came.</p>
<p>Could it be more than a coincidence that the mysterious phone was dug out from the ancient city? Seeing that the phone’s battery had jumped from 1% to 2%, Zhou Wen picked up the phone and attempted to use it. He realized that he couldn’t use the phone at all as it remained on the charging screen.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what are you doing?” Li Xuan shouted as he pushed open the door and walked in.</p>
<p>Many things had happened in Guide Ancient City recently. Zhou Wen was the kind of boss who left everything to others. Most of the work was coordinated by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“When did you arrive?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Not long ago. Why?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Did you hear anything or see anything?” Zhou Wen asked again. “Are you talking about your yard? Did a spy barge in? I didn’t hear or see anything.” Li Xuan immediately sized up the yard warily, but he didn’t discover anything.</p>
<p>“No, didn’t you see the light rushing out of the ancient well?” Zhou Wen recounted the skeleton’s appearance, but he didn’t mention the portable charger. It wasn’t easy to explain.</p>
<p>“According to what you said, I should have been able to see it from afar. However, I didn’t see anything just now. Guide Ancient City is indeed a little odd. I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse for us to occupy this place. I hope nothing bad will happen.” Li Xuan paused before continuing, “There’s something I need to discuss with you. The Niten Flying Immortal Palace from overseas has contacted us and wants to migrate to Guide Ancient City. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before recalling Sei Gasakai. After some thought, he said, “Although the Niten Flying Immortal Palace established by Sei Gasakai is an overseas faction, it hasn’t had much of a conflict with the mainland. It has always been neutral. Furthermore, in this era, be it overseas or the mainland, they are all a part of humanity. We are also in need of manpower now. If there aren’t any unresolvable grudges between us, there’s no harm in taking them in.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought too. However, there’s still some tiny trouble,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What trouble?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“The Niten Flying Immortal Palace had already wanted to move inland some time ago. The six families and some major factions were very interested in them and had contacted them. Furthermore, they offered pretty good conditions. Those conditions even tempted me when I heard them, but for some reason, they rejected them all and took the initiative to contact us. They wanted to move to our place, but the conditions they raised were far inferior to the conditions the six families gave them.” Li Xuan paused to give Zhou Wen some time to digest.</p>
<p>“Are you suspecting their motives?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“A little, but that’s not the most important thing. The most important thing is that the Family Clan of Gods seems to be determined to rope in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. Not only did they actively contact them again and offer better conditions, but they also used their connections to tactfully express their wish for us to reject the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.” Li Xuan recounted the entire matter.</p>
<p>“Who did they find?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Someone from your family.” Li Xuan didn’t say it directly.</p>
<p>“The An family?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Yes, but Brother Sheng contacted me. He said that there’s no need to worry too much. If there’s a need, we can directly take in the people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace,” Li Xuan added.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard that, he roughly understood that the Family Clan of Gods had definitely exerted pressure on the An family.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1672'>Chapter 1672 Everything Beneath the Sky Is Divine Soil</h3>
<p>“Old Zhou, what do you think we should do?” Li Xuan was a fearless person. He wasn’t asking if he should take in the people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, but asking Zhou Wen how he could bring them back to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>According to Li Xuan’s intentions, they had to take these people in regardless of whether the An family could withstand the pressure. The problem was that since the Family Clan of Gods was so insistent, they definitely had ulterior motives. They wouldn’t easily let Honn Shinsakura and Sei Gasakai safely bring the group of people to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>“I’ll pick them up,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“Alright. Since you have nothing better to do, it’s good to take a walk,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>He wanted to pick them up himself, but this was early in Guide Ancient City’s development. There were too many things that he needed to do, and Zhou Wen was a boss who left everything to him. Li Xuan really couldn’t leave.</p>
<p>“Pay more attention to the city when I’m not around,” Zhou Wen said as he packed.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I haven’t done so while you are around,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. He hadn’t been taxed with the city’s matters. Li Xuan did all the work.</p>
<p>“Then this is what we’ll tell them. I’ll reply to Honn Shinsakura. He’s still waiting.” As Li Xuan spoke, he walked out without chatting with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen packed his things and looked at his phone that was charging. He realized that it had already charged to 3%. He estimated that it would take more than a day to fully charge</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Before receiving Zhou Wen’s reply, the Niten Flying Immortal Palace overseas had already begun mobilizing people for the migration. It was definitely not a trivial matter for more than ten thousand people to migrate inland. There were too many things that needed to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Dozens of ships were pulled inland by whale-like Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, our luck isn’t bad. We didn’t encounter any especially terrifying marine dimensional creatures.” Shiraishi Satomi couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when she saw the coastline from afar.</p>
<p>There were many break-out dimensional zones at sea, and terrifying dimensional creatures would appear from time to time. Even the safe routes they had taken in the past couldn’t guarantee absolute safety now.</p>
<p>Being able to reach inland without any harrowing surprises was a good sign.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, the terrifying ones aren’t those dimensional creatures,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly as he stood at the bow.</p>
<p>“Palace Lord, don’t worry. We have already planned the route inland and have made arrangements along the way. There won’t be too many problems,” the jaundiced Elder said.</p>
<p>Just as Shiraishi Satomi was about to ask something, her gaze suddenly focused. She saw a person standing on the dock by the beach.</p>
<p>“He’s here indeed.” Honn Shinsakura also saw the person. He seemed to have expected it and wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>“Mohe from the Family Clan of Gods. Why is he here?” The jaundiced Elder’s expression changed as the other Elders were alarmed.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Mohe to come to the beach for no reason. Now, Mohe was famous. He was one of the best humans.</p>
<p>Even in an era with many representatives, his ranking on the Cube had never dropped out of the top three.</p>
<p>The most terrifying thing was that up to now, no one had been able to find Mohe’s weakness. Mohe was very strong and could easily kill Calamity creatures. What was even more terrifying was that no one could injure him. Injuring Mohe was equivalent to injuring themselves. Mohe would be fine, while his opponent would die.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please stay.” The black-robed Mohe stood by the beach. His face was angular like a beautiful chiseled marble statue.</p>
<p>Dozens of ships stopped in front of the dock. The huge whale-like Companion Beast floated above the sea as it stared angrily at the tiny human figure. “Mohe, why are you blocking our path?” the jaundiced Elder asked Mohe.</p>
<p>“I’ve never thought of blocking your path. Instead, I’m here to guide everyone,” Mohe said calmly.</p>
<p>“I wonder what path you will point us in?” the jaundiced Elder asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“A path of survival,” Mohe said indifferently. “Everything below the heavens is divine soil. Only the citizens of the gods can live on it. If they aren’t divine citizens, how can there be a path of survival?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the Family Clan of Gods too authoritative? If we don’t enter the Family Clan of Gods, are you not allowing us to step onto the ground?” The jaundiced Elder’s expression turned ugly.</p>
<p>“No.” Mohe shook his head and said, “Regardless of whether it’s the sea or the ground, it is all divine soil. If one doesn’t obtain the favor of God, there will be no place for one to have a foothold in this world regardless of how big the world is. One can only sink.”</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace heard it clearly as their expressions changed drastically. Mohe had made it clear that if they didn’t join the Family Clan of Gods, they would probably be buried in the sea today.</p>
<p>If anyone else said such words, they would only treat it as a joke. However, they had already seen how terrifying Mohe was on the Cube’s livestream. He had the ability to say such words.</p>
<p>“Is this the only way?” Honn Shinsakura finally said as he stared at Mohe with a burning gaze.</p>
<p>“This is the only way,” Mohe answered with certainty.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura didn’t say anything else. He silently pulled out two samurai swords, one long and one short. His aura constantly converged as he stared at Mohe like an abyss.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace on the dozens of ships also summoned their Companion Beasts. They drew their weapons and pointed them at Mohe. The huge Companion Beasts in the sea roared in unison, stirring up stormy waves as though they wanted to devour Mohe.</p>
<p>Mohe stood there motionless as though he hadn’t seen the shocking killing intent. He was like a god that looked down on all life.</p>
<p>Seeing Mohe’s lofty stance, Honn Shinsakura laughed. He looked at Mohe and said indifferently, “Mohe, your strength is indeed very strong and magical, but if you don’t touch me, your strength won’t be of any use.”</p>
<p>With that said, Honn Shinsakura gave the order to steer the ship towards the dock. They were not to attack Mohe.</p>
<p>Hundreds of giant whale-like Companion Beasts roared and swam towards the dock.</p>
<p>Mohe wasn’t surprised or delighted as he looked at the behemoths and ships that were rushing over. He slowly raised his right palm towards the sea. When he was facing the sea, his fingers suddenly clenched tightly.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Explosions sounded incessantly. The hundreds of giant whale-like beasts seemed to be gripped by an invisible hand as their bodies deformed from the pressure and instantly exploded.</p>
<p>None of the behemoths that pulled the boat survived. Blood instantly dyed the entire sea surface. The seawater turned blood-red and churned with the waves like an Asura sea of blood.</p>
<p>The waves that carried the blood struck the ships, splattering onto the bodies of the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. Everyone seemed to have fallen into a demonic realm as they lost their ability to think due to the scene in front of them. They stood there in a daze, their faces filled with horror.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Mohe as though they were looking at a devil from hell. They couldn’t help but tremble. The timid disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace involuntarily retreated.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1673'>Chapter 1673 This And Nothing More</h3>
<p>Honn Shinsakura stared at Mohe and couldn’t help but feel his heart turn cold. Although he was determined to fight to the death, he couldn’t draw his sword to fight.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary opponent, even if their strength was far above his, Honn Shinsakura would still have the courage to fight.</p>
<p>However, Mohe was different. Only he could kill others, while others couldn’t kill him. Even if Honn Shinsakura could slice through celestial bodies, he couldn’t slash at Mohe. Otherwise, he would only injure himself. Honn Shinsakura was instantly thrown into a dilemma.</p>
<p>“Must you do this?” Sei Gasakai walked out of the cabin and stared at Mohe.</p>
<p>When Mohe saw Sei Gasakai, he cracked a smile and looked at him. “I heard that you have the title of Sword Sage overseas. The Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is known as the number one sword art overseas.”</p>
<p>“It’s just flattery,” Sei Gasakai said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Probably.” Mohe nodded.</p>
<p>These words immediately infuriated the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Perhaps Sei Gasakai wasn’t the strongest human on Earth, but his Sword Dao realm made him like a saint in the hearts of the disciples.</p>
<p>“A warrior can be killed but not humiliated. Mohe, I’ll fight you,” Honn Shinsakura said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“You aren’t qualified.” Mohe didn’t even look at Honn Shinsakura and said to Sei Gasakai, “Since you are known as the overseas Sword Sage, I believe you might have some true talent. I’ll give you a chance. I’ll only fight you with my sword techniques and suppress my strength to the same level as yours. If you can withstand three of my strikes without being defeated, I’ll let you have your freedom. If you lose, the Niten Flying Immortal Palace will have to come under my Family Clan of Gods. Do you dare to agree?”</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai knew very well that it was impossible for things to end peacefully today. If he agreed, there was still a chance. If he didn’t agree, the Niten Flying Immortal Palace would probably not be able to escape the calamity of destruction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sei Gasakai was very confident in his Sword Dao. Ignoring the difference in level, he didn’t believe that he was inferior to Mohe in terms of Sword Dao realm. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t even withstand three strikes.</p>
<p>“Can your words represent the Family Clan of Gods?” Sei Gasakai asked Mohe.</p>
<p>“If I allow you to leave, no one in the Family Clan of Gods will dare touch you. Of course, the premise is that you, the Sword Sage, can withstand three of my strikes without being defeated,” said Mohe indifferently. His goal was to bring the Niten Flying Immortal Palace back to the Family Clan of Gods, not to kill. The killing of the Companion Beasts that pulled the ships was only to intimidate everyone.</p>
<p>“Alright, three strikes to decide the victor.” Sei Gasakai’s mind was calm. He wasn’t moved by Mohe’s words. At the same time, he didn’t really want to remain undefeated after three strikes. Instead, he wanted to win.</p>
<p>If a sword expert didn’t have the intention to win and only had the mentality of surviving three strikes without being defeated, he would have already been defeated.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai summoned two Companion Beasts —samurai swords, one long and one short. The blades’ material looked the same, and they presented a demonic purple color. There seemed to be a faint sanguine glow amidst the purple.</p>
<p>“My weapons are called Ghost Cry and God Howl. They are both growth-type Companion Beasts. They have already grown to the Calamity grade and are higher than my level. When I fight you with this sword, you don’t have to hold back. Just use your Calamity-grade strength,” Sei Gasakai said.</p>
<p>“They are just external objects.” With a casual wave of Mohe’s hand, seawater surged into his palm like a fountain. Under the effects of the cold air in his palm, it condensed into a rapier.</p>
<p>He casually shook the ice sword and said, “Since you are at the Terror grade, I’ll suppress my strength to the Terror grade. Receive three strikes from me and you can go wherever you want.”</p>
<p>Most of the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace wore looks of indignation. Mohe’s actions were an insult to the Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Some people secretly rejoiced and felt that Sei Gasakai’s chances of winning were higher, but they were also worried that Mohe wouldn’t keep his promise.</p>
<p>“Please.” Sei Gasakai’s mind was calm like an ancient well. He didn’t show any emotions because of Mohe’s words. He stood in the sea like a mountain with his sword calmly.</p>
<p>“You do have the demeanor of a Sword Sage.” Mohe nodded slightly as his eyes turned serious. He thrust the ice sword at Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>It was completely different from the aura used to crush hundreds of Companion Beasts with one hand. His thrust was ordinary and simple. It could even be said to be ridiculously ordinary. There were no sword beams or sword aura. The thrust was also very slow, so slow that it felt like he was fooling around.</p>
<p>Mohe was still standing on the dock, hundreds of meters away from Sei Gasakai on the sea. When he stabbed out, he didn’t move and continued standing on the dock.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the slowly stabbing sword tip seemed to be approaching Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Sei Gasakai. All the spectators felt as though the sword was stabbing at their hearts. Those with weak willpower turned pale from shock and involuntarily retreated.</p>
<p>However, no matter how they retreated, they couldn’t shake off the feeling that the tip of the sword was about to stab their hearts. It was as though their hearts would be pierced the next second.</p>
<p>When Honn Shinsakura and Shiraishi Satomi saw this strike, their expressions turned abnormally solemn.</p>
<p>They knew that it was very difficult to master swift sword strikes. The faster the sword was, the easier it was to kill.</p>
<p>However, as long as one continued practicing, the sword would always become faster. It was just a matter of how fast it became.</p>
<p>However, if one wanted to master a slow sword strike, it wasn’t something that could be learned through practice. One had to have extremely high talent in the way of the sword and have an opportunity to gain an epiphany. Only then could one slow down their swift sword.</p>
<p>Mohe’s slow strike was clearly not as simple as being slow. Its realm was so high that even Honn Shinsakura was alarmed.</p>
<p>The sword slowly stabbed over. It looked easy to crack, but when he really tried to crack it, he realized that it was impossible.</p>
<p>This was because he was too slow. No matter how one dealt with him, one would expose their intentions to the other party. The situation that was originally a stalemate would suddenly result in the other party being in a passive position.</p>
<p>However, if he didn’t resolve the slow sword, the sword would slowly stab at him like how hot water cooked a frog. Once it entered the opponent’s killing range, it would be impossible to crack.</p>
<p>Neither staying still nor moving worked. Sei Gasakai immediately fell into a dilemma.</p>
<p>was were worried for Sei Gasakai, but Sei Gasakai remained calm and composed. Without any hesitation, he slashed at Mohe with his weapon, Ghost Cry.</p>
<p>His strike wasn’t slow at all. On the contrary, it was as fast as a fleeting glimpse. It slashed in front of Mohe in an instant.</p>
<p>“Amazing!” Honn Shinsakura couldn’t help but exclaim. This was the most authentic Niten Flying Immortal-ryū.</p>
<p>He used the longer weapon to slash at the enemy and have the shorter one protect the body; the movement was like the spinning of Yin and Yang. It was the best way to resolve a slow sword, but it was only something Sei Gasakai was capable of at his realm.</p>
<p>The terrifying beam produced by Ghost Cry had already slashed in front of Mohe. If Mohe continued stabbing forward, his sword would be blocked by the short blade—God Howl. If he retracted his sword and dodged, he would immediately fall into a disadvantage. Ignoring the three strikes, even if he struck out with three hundred or three thousand strikes, it would probably be impossible for him to defeat Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t retreat or even have the intention of retracting his sword. He used the ice sword condensed from seawater to meet Sei Gasakai’s Calamity-grade blade, Ghost Cry.</p>
<p>“Is he going to break the contract?” Everyone’s hearts skipped a beat.</p>
<p>How could an ice sword condensed from seawater resist a Calamity-grade Companion Beast weapon unless Mohe used his Calamity-grade strength?</p>
<p>However, even when the blades clashed, Mohe didn’t use his Calamity-grade power. The ice sword shattered without a doubt.</p>
<p>Everyone was overjoyed, but in the next moment, everyone’s faces turned ashen. They stood rooted to the ground, unable to believe what they had seen.</p>
<p>When the blades collided, Mohe’s ice sword was shattered. However, his sword was condensed from seawater to begin with. The shattered ice sword melted into water. As Mohe’s sword stance continued forward, it condensed into a sword and pointed at Sei Gasakai’s chest.</p>
<p>“Everything has its own characteristics. The way to interpromotion and interrestraint depends on one’s heart. Yet, you haven’t even figured out this point. It looks like the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is this and nothing more,” said Mohe indifferently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1674'>Chapter 1674 Three Strikes</h3>
<p>“You lost. Bring the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace along and return to the Family Clan of Gods with me.” Mohe released his palm and the ice sword in his hand transformed into water that flowed into the sea.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace turned ashen. Despite Sei Gasakai’s abilities, Mohe had actually suppressed his strength to the same level as him. Furthermore, despite Sei Gasakai using the Calamity-grade Ghost Cry and God Howling blades, he couldn’t even withstand a single strike. This made them suspect Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was speechless. He had lost so thoroughly that there was nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Mohe turned around and was about to leave when he saw a youth standing not far behind him. The youth stood there silently sizing him up with a look of interest. This made Mohe frown.</p>
<p>The youth was less than a hundred meters away from him. He hadn’t sensed the other party’s arrival at all despite this distance. Just this alone surprised him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou!” When Sei Gasakai saw Zhou Wen, he said guiltily, “I’m sorry I lost. I can only follow the agreement and head to the Family Clan of Gods.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Qi, there’s no need to take it to heart.” Zhou Wen smiled and said to Mohe, “The Family Clan of Gods is such a huge conglomerate. I don’t think they will snatch my guests from me.”</p>
<p>Mohe looked at Zhou Wen and said, “That depends on whether you have the ability to take the guests.”</p>
<p>“You say that the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is this and nothing more. I wonder if you dare make a pact of three strikes with me?” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“You indeed live up to your name as Deceit King. You are truly a deceptive person,” Mohe mocked.</p>
<p>The fact that Zhou Wen was Deceit King was no longer a secret among the six families. Before becoming the representative, Mohe had seen Zhou Wen’s battle through the Cube, so he naturally didn’t dare underestimate him.</p>
<p>He dared to make a pact of three strikes with Sei Gasakai, but he didn’t dare do the same for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Mohe believed that Zhou Wen was stronger than him. It was only because Deceit King had displayed his powerful spatial abilities. Even if Zhou Wen only dodged, he wasn’t confident of defeating him in three strikes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason that Mohe could defeat Sei Gasakai in one strike wasn’t that his Sword Dao realm was really much stronger than Sei Gasakai’s. Before coming, Mohe had studied the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū’s Sword Dao and gathered a large amount of information on Sei Gasakai. It could be said that he knew Sei Gasakai like the back of his hand. That was why he could defeat the enemy with one strike. It was his style to plan before taking action.</p>
<p>The Family Clan of Gods had plenty of information on Zhou Wen, but they couldn’t completely understand Zhou Wen through such information. At the very least, Mohe believed that what the information revealed wasn’t everything about Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You misunderstood me. I’m not asking you to defeat me in three strikes.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Then do you mean that you want me to receive your three strikes?” Mohe’s expression turned cold as he couldn’t help but feel angry. Ever since he became a representative, he had never suffered such derision.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was famous as Deceit King, that was only in the past. Mohe didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the right to say such things to the present him.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Zhou Wen shook his head again.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Mohe’s expression softened. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Then what do you mean by pact of three strikes?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t answer him as he waved at Honn Shinsakura. “Come over and help me.”</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura was taken aback when he heard that. He didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, but he still walked over the waves and headed to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>“Master, why did Zhou Wen get Honn Shinsakura to go over?” Shiraishi Satomi asked Sei Gasakai in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“How can we see through a figure like him? However, Mr. Zhou definitely has his reasons. Just keep watching,” Sei Gasakai said.</p>
<p>“Sir, what are your orders?” Honn Shinsakura came in front of Zhou Wen and bowed.</p>
<p>“I remember that you are Mr. Sei’s disciple. You should have obtained the true teachings of Mr. Sei’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, right?” Zhou Wen asked Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to as he watched without a word.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare call it true teachings. I’ve been working hard to follow in Master’s footsteps,” Honn Shinsakura answered.</p>
<p>“Sakura’s Sword Dao is about to reach my realm,” Sei Gasakai said.</p>
<p>“It’s enough.” Zhou Wen nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you up to?” Mohe asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“You just said that the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is this and nothing more. Then I’ll impart three strikes of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū on Mr. Sei’s behalf. It’s the same rule as before. If you can withstand three strikes from him without being defeated, you can take them anywhere you want.” When Zhou Wen said that, everyone was stunned speechless.</p>
<p>Everyone had already seen Mohe’s strength. Even Sei Gasakai couldn’t withstand a single strike. Although Honn Shinsakura was a genius and his cultivation in the way of the sword was close to Sei Gasakai’s, it was unbelievable that he could defeat Mohe after learning three sword strikes.</p>
<p>This time, it wasn’t just Mohe’s expression. Even his eyes turned cold as he stared intently at Zhou Wen and said, “You will pay the price for your arrogance.”</p>
<p>“All you need to do is answer whether you’ll take the bet,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish. However, after that, I’ll fight you. I originally didn’t want to be your enemy, but you’re forcing me,” Mohe said coldly.</p>
<p>“Get through his three strikes without being defeated first.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he waved his hand at Honn Shinsakura. “Lend me your blade. I’ll teach you three strikes on behalf of Mr. Sei.”</p>
<p>Although Honn Shinsakura was somewhat puzzled, he still handed the blade to Zhou Wen with both hands.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the samurai sword and casually brandished it twice as though he was familiarizing himself with the blade’s center of gravity.</p>
<p>“Master, isn’t Zhou Wen being too arrogant?” Shiraishi Satomi said with an odd expression.</p>
<p>Although she knew that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, it wasn’t easy to defeat Mohe even with the strength Human Sovereign had displayed in the past. To be able to defeat Mohe by teaching Honn Shinsakura three strikes on the spot was unbelievable.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t just Shiraishi Satomi. The Elders also felt that Zhou Wen was a little condescending. Even if he was Human Sovereign, he couldn’t underestimate an expert at Mohe’s level.</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Wen really had such a powerful Sword Dao, it was impossible for Honn Shinsakura to immediately master his profound Sword Dao. No matter how talented a swordsman was, it was impossible for him to master a profound sword technique in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>What was even more unacceptable was that Zhou Wen had actually begun imparting the Honn Shinsakura Sword Art in front of Mohe without any intention of concealment.</p>
<p>Can we rely on… this person? It wasn’t just the Elders. Even the ordinary disciples felt that Zhou Wen’s actions were a little too childish.</p>
<p>To teach three strikes in front of the opponent and to use those same three strikes to defeat him, was he treating the opponent as an idiot?</p>
<h3 id='chapter1675'>Chapter 1675 Education</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was naturally not an unreliable person. He wasn’t making such a condition to insult Mohe.</p>
<p>In fact, he had already arrived when Sei Gasakai fought Mohe. Back then, Sei Gasakai had already agreed to Mohe’s challenge. It was too late for him to stop it.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sei Gasakai fought Mohe, Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain to observe the extent of Mohe’s abilities.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain was a Calamity Zone derived from the Dao Sutra. The game’s introduction was the Domain of Education. Its actual use could block the different nomological powers. At the same time, it could study how the other party’s power worked. It could even produce an Essence Energy Art by studying the other party’s nomological power. Zhou Wen originally only wanted to study Mohe’s powers, hoping to figure out what kind of power the reflective power was. However, when Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain to observe it, he made an unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>This discovery didn’t stem from Mohe, but because of Sei Gasakai.</p>
<p>This was because Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū was inspired by Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Immortal Slaying. It could be said to share the same lineage as Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao.</p>
<p>When Sei Gasakai used the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū’s Sword Dao, Zhou Wen discovered some other abilities in the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>In the Teacher Domain, not only could Zhou Wen clearly sense all the pros and cons of Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, but the Teacher Domain had even automatically modified the flaws of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, giving Zhou Wen new insights into the Teacher Domain’s abilities.</p>
<p>He could clearly sense that as long as he was willing, he could use the Teacher Domain to make up for the flaws of Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. He could even directly raise Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao realm.</p>
<p>So that’s how it is. The so-called Domain of Education is indeed not as simple as imitating and learning. Zhou Wen came to a realization.</p>
<p>Having Sei Gasakai use the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū to fight Mohe in the Teacher Domain was almost equivalent to Zhou Wen fighting Mohe himself. Now, Zhou Wen had already made a judgment on Mohe’s Sword Dao realm. At the same time, he wanted to test the Teacher Domain’s new ability, so he had raised such a condition.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even vaguely felt that he had found a path of advancement for the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura looked at Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but feel nervous. The Sword Dao Zhou Wen had imparted was probably extremely profound. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to defeat Mohe.</p>
<p>He didn’t doubt Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao standards, but he was afraid that he couldn’t master the sword techniques Zhou Wen imparted to him in such a short period of</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be nervous. Just taking it easy while learning it will be enough,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>These words sounded arrogant in the ears of others, but that was the truth. This was because he wanted to use the Teacher Domain to directly raise Honn Shinsakura’s Sword Dao realm and not really let him learn the three strikes.</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best,” Honn Shinsakura said seriously.</p>
<p>“Then watch carefully.” Zhou Wen didn’t say another word. After activating the Teacher Domain, he began brandishing the saber in his hand.</p>
<p>Everyone was drawn to his actions. They wanted to see what peerless sword technique he was teaching to allow Honn Shinsakura to defeat Mohe in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Even Mohe couldn’t help but focus on Zhou Wen’s sword technique. He also wanted to know how good Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao was.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t believe that he would lose to Honn Shinsakura. He was already preparing to defeat Zhou Wen after defeating him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s next three strikes made everyone widen their eyes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because the sword technique Zhou Wen taught was profound and powerful, but because the sword technique Zhou Wen taught was too simple. It was so simple that all the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace could understand it.</p>
<p>Even the young Mortal-stage disciples understood the sword technique Zhou Wen had taught.</p>
<p>In fact, it was very difficult for them not to understand it even if they wanted to. This was because the sword technique Zhou Wen had displayed was the most basic sword technique of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Even a young child of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace had practiced it countless times and was extremely familiar with it.</p>
<p>“Master… What’s going on?” Shiraishi Satomi began to doubt her eyes. She suspected that Zhou Wen had taught something so profound that she couldn’t understand it.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai was equally puzzled. He also suspected that Zhou Wen’s ordinary three strikes contained some profundity, but he really couldn’t tell what was different between them and the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū basic sword stances he had created.</p>
<p>Mohe knitted his brows tightly. He had focused on studying the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, so he naturally knew the basic sword moves like the back of his hand. However, he couldn’t tell how Zhou Wen could defeat him with these three strikes.</p>
<p>Disregarding how Honn Shinsakura could defeat him with three strikes, even if Zhou Wen were to use them himself, Mohe didn’t believe that they would be of any use.</p>
<p>The others couldn’t sense anything, but Honn Shinsakura felt something completely different.</p>
<p>Under the effects of the Teacher Domain, the ordinary three strikes struck Honn Shinsakura’s brain like three bolts of lightning, enlightening him. His mind exploded with many unprecedented sword experiences.</p>
<p>So the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū I mastered has so many flaws… So this is the profundity of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū… I never expected there to be such a realm…</p>
<p>The three simple strikes in the eyes of others caused Honn Shinsakura to produce the effect of three epiphanies. His cultivation in the Sword Dao had already approached Sei Gasakai, but he suddenly had three epiphanies. His realm in the Sword Dao instantly rose to an unbelievable realm.</p>
<p>How rare was an epiphany? A swordsman who had an epiphany once in his life could become a sword master of a generation.</p>
<p>For example, Sei Gasakai had one epiphany because of Zhou Wen. This resulted in him establishing the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū and gaining the reputation of the Sword Sage</p>
<p>overseas.</p>
<p>Now, Honn Shinsakura had experienced three consecutive enlightenments. It was an unbelievably fortuitous encounter. In a moment, his Sword Dao realm had reached a status that even Sei Gasakai found difficult to reach. At that moment, he was pleasantly surprised. He almost couldn’t believe that he had gained such insights. He looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a god.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t a god, how could he use three simple strikes to give him such insight?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Honn Shinsakura and was also pleasantly surprised. With Honn Shinsakura’s epiphany and improvement, his Teacher Domain began to improve, evolving from the Human Realm to the Hell level.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that by using the Teacher Domain to educate Honn Shinsakura, Honn Shinsakura’s comprehension of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū should have reached the limits of his comprehension.</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the case. After Honn Shinsakura experienced three epiphanies, the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū Sword Dao he had comprehended had exceeded the limits of the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>The Master guides one into the way. Cultivation depends on the individual. The education of the Teacher Domain is no longer limited to one’s bottleneck. The enlightenment of the educated will be reflected in the Teacher Domain if they exceed the Teacher Domain… Zhou Wen had already completely understood the Teacher Domain’s abilities.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1676'>Chapter 1676: Same Plot</h3>
<h5>Translator: CKtalon </h5>
<p>“His sword technique is nothing much. Unless he uses powers above the Terror grade, these three strikes should be enough for you to defeat him.” Zhou Wen threw the blade back to Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to use words to taunt me. Since I’ve said that I would only use powers on the same level as him, I definitely won’t go back on my word. If I use powers above the Terror grade, it will naturally be considered a loss,” said Mohe coldly.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe that Honn Shinsakura could defeat him with these three strikes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen declined to comment, but Honn Shinsakura suddenly bowed at him as a form of thanks. He said solemnly, “I’ll remember your kindness in imparting the Dao.”</p>
<p>“Go.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Only then did Honn Shinsakura stand up and walk towards Mohe with his blade in hand.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace wore odd expressions. They really couldn’t tell how the three strikes that Zhou Wen had taught were worth Honn Shinsakura’s bow.</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi also wore a puzzled expression as she looked at Sei Gasakai and asked, “Master, are Zhou Wen’s three strikes really that magical?”</p>
<p>She knew how proud Honn Shinsakura was. To be able to make him bow so respectfully meant that he almost treated Zhou Wen as a master. It also indirectly meant that the three strikes were definitely extraordinary. However, Shiraishi Satomi couldn’t tell how the three strikes were different from the basic sword moves she had learned in the past.</p>
<p>“How can a figure like Mr. Zhou spout nonsense?” Sei Gasakai couldn’t tell what was so profound about the three swords, but he could sense that Honn Shinsakura’s aura had changed.</p>
<p>This change didn’t seem obvious. If Honn Shinsakura hadn’t been taught by Sei Gasakai, it would have been difficult for him to notice this change.</p>
<p>“Please be careful of my blade.” Honn Shinsakura stopped opposite Mohe. He held the blade Zhou Wen had borrowed and didn’t summon the second short blade he often used.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryü used dual blades, so Honn Shinsakura was naturally best at dual blades. He only used one instead of two not because Zhou Wen had only used one saber for the three strikes he had taught, but because Honn Shinsakura wanted to avenge Sei Gasakai’s humiliation. Since Mohe had defeated him with a water sword, he had to use a single blade to defeat Mohe.</p>
<p>Mohe looked at Honn Shinsakura as a strange glint flashed in his eyes. After all, he was a Calamity-grade expert. He could sense the changes in Honn Shinsakura’s aura, but he still couldn’t figure out what Honn Shinsakura had learned from the three strikes. He could only watch helplessly as Zhou Wen taught the three strikes. He really couldn’t figure out what tricks the three strikes could produce.</p>
<p>Mohe casually grabbed and condensed seawater into a sword again. He looked at Honn Shinsakura and said indifferently, “Don’t waste any more time.</p>
<p>Attack.”</p>
<p>Although he knew that Honn Shinsakura had grown, Mohe didn’t believe that he could grow to the point of defeating him. Even if Zhou Wen had taught him a godlike sword technique, it was impossible for him to raise Honn Shinsakura to a level that could match him in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the three strikes Zhou Wen taught were only the basic sword techniques of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryü.</p>
<p>In a true battle between experts, confidence was also an important part. If one wasn’t confident, it would be very difficult to win unless one’s strength was truly overwhelming. How could Mohe make such a mistake?</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura didn’t say anything else. He held the blade in one hand and slashed at Mohe.</p>
<p>This strike wasn’t one of the three strikes Zhou Wen had taught him. Instead, it was the strike Sei Gasakai had slashed at Mohe. It was almost identical without any difference.</p>
<p>Indeed, the three strikes Zhou Wen taught are useless. He’s using Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao. Those three strikes arejust a ruse. However, aren’t you underestimating me? How can such a trick succeed in front of me?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’ve just cracked the sword stance he’s using. A thought flashed through Mohe’s mind, but he didn’t hesitate to thrust his sword out again.</p>
<p>The battle between the two was almost a replay of the battle between Sei Gasakai and Mohe. The only difference was that Honn Shinsakura only had one blade in his hand and didn’t have the ability to protect himself.</p>
<p>“This…” Shiraishi Satomi was at a loss for words. Sei Gasakai had already tried using the same strike, so this strike was bound to fail. Yet, Honn Shinsakura had actually replicated his attempt.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just her. None of the disciples of the Niten Flymg Immortal Palace understood. The Elders even wondered if Honn Shinsakura’s brain was damaged.</p>
<p>Only Sei Gasakai seemed to understand something. He shook his head slightly and said with a smile, “This child sure is thoughtful.”</p>
<p>The ice sword that advanced at an extremely slow speed collided with the blade that slashed over crazily again. The ice sword was shattered again. Everything was identical to the last time, as though a movie had been replayed.</p>
<p>Although Mohe was confident, he was still somewhat afraid. Therefore, he held back and prepared to deal with any development that cropped up.</p>
<p>However, nothing happened. Honn Shinsakura’s blade shattered his ice sword. The ice sword fragments transformed into water that flowed past Honn</p>
<p>Shinsakura’s blade and condensed into a water sword that pointed at his chest.</p>
<p>I won? Mohe naturally found it unbelievable that everything would go so smoothly, but seeing that the water sword was about to stab Honn Shinsakura’s chest, he had to believe it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mohe’s heart palpitated as though he sensed dire danger. His eyes focused and he immediately realized that Honn Shinsakura’s blade had already slashed at his waist at some point in time.</p>
<p>His sword and Honn Shinsakura’s blade could hit each other almost at the same time, but he only held a water sword while Honn Shinsakura held a Terror-grade Companion Beast blade. If they were to hit each other, the outcome would be different.</p>
<p>Unless Mohe used powers that exceeded the Terror grade, he would definitely be the one suffering. When that happened, he would naturally lose.</p>
<p>I thought it was some brilliant sword technique, but it turns out that you just want to use this method to defeat me. Aren’t you too naive? Mohe’s</p>
<p>Calamity-grade thinking ability and reaction were naturally not something Honn Shinsakura could compare with. At that instant, countless thoughts flashed through Mohe’s mind.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, his body naturally moved. His figure moved slightly as he maintained the water sword’s thrust and speed.</p>
<p>This way, Honn Shinsakura’s blade would brush past him, and his water sword would hit Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>In fact, this reaction had exceeded the limits of the Terror grade. However, this wasn’t a substantial Calamity -grade power, so it couldn’t be said that the Mohe violated the rules.</p>
<p>However, after Mohe did all of this, his pupils suddenly constricted as he revealed a look of disbelief as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that Honn Shinsakura had used all his strength to slash out, but that wasn’t the case at all. Honn Shinsakura’s reaction speed was far inferior to his, so it was impossible for him to keep up with his changes and adapt. However, Honn Shinsakura seemed to have anticipated the change in moves. The blade’s angle changed midway—almost at the same moment as Mohe. It happened to restrain Mohe’s new move.</p>
<p>Mohe never expected such a situation to happen. It was as though his opponent was prescient. If he hadn’t moved and continued the stab, Honn Shinsakura would have already lost.</p>
<p>However, due to his movement, Honn Shinsakura happened to be able to restrain him. At such a close distance, unless he used the speed of a Calamity-grade to move again, he wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p>
<p>In that instant of hesitation, the water sword in Mohe’s hand was shattered by the blade in Honn Shinsakura’s hand. The tip of the blade stopped in front of Mohe’s chest.</p>
<p>Instantly, there was only the sound of the sea waves. Everyone seemed to be petrified as they watched Honn Shinsakura point his blade at Mohe’s chest.</p>
<p>“Am I f*cking dreaming?” On the ship, someone shouted in a fugue..</p>
<h3 id='chapter1677'>Chapter 1677 Easy Advancement</h3>
<p>“Am I still living in a dream?” The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace widened their eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>With just one strike, Honn Shinsakura had actually defeated the unparalleled Mohe in sword technique. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, what surprised them the most wasn’t that Honn Shinsakura had defeated Mohe with one strike, but that Zhou Wen had only taught him three simple strikes, allowing Honn Shinsakura’s Sword Dao to advance so rapidly.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura’s sword technique was originally weaker than Sei Gasakai’s. Even Sei Gasakai had been defeated by Mohe with one strike, but now, Honn Shinsakura had turned the tables. This was an unimaginable difference.</p>
<p>All the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace looked at Zhou Wen as though they were looking at a god or an immortal pill. It was as though they could immediately ascend to immortality if they swallowed him.</p>
<p>The people who knew Honn Shinsakura found it even more unbelievable.</p>
<p>Take Shiraishi Satomi for example. She often practiced swordsmanship with Honn Shinsakura, so she knew his Sword Dao very well. But now, she realized that Honn Shinsakura’s Sword Dao was like the sea, making it impossible for her to see its depths. It even made her feel puny in front of a mountain.</p>
<p>And all of this was because Zhou Wen had taught him three strikes. It was miraculous.</p>
<p>Mohe stared intently at Honn Shinsakura. He couldn’t believe that Honn Shinsakura had become so strong just because Zhou Wen had taught him three strikes. However, the truth was right in front of him, so he had no choice but to believe it.</p>
<p>If Honn Shinsakura had such standards long ago, he wouldn’t have watched Sei Gasakai’s defeat without doing anything.</p>
<p>Is Zhou Wen’s teaching standards so high or is Honn Shinsakura’s perceptivity too terrifying? This thought flashed through Mohe’s mind as he instantly answered himself.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura had been with Sei Gasakai for so many years. If his talent was really that strong, he would have long formed his own faction. He would have long surpassed Sei Gasakai, so he wouldn’t have waited until now to have such a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The only explanation was that Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao was just so powerful.</p>
<p>Although Mohe wasn’t willing to believe it, he had to admit that he didn’t understand how Zhou Wen had taught him. This made him suspect his realm and standards for a moment.</p>
<p>“You lost,” Honn Shinsakura retracted his blade and said to Mohe.</p>
<p>“I definitely won’t go back on my word. I won’t stop anyone from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace from going anywhere.” With that said, Mohe ignored Honn Shinsakura and turned to Zhou Wen. He stared at him and said, “Deceit King lives up to his reputation. You’re even stronger than the rumors. I wonder if you dare fight me?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was filled with joy because with Honn Shinsakura’s epiphany, his Teacher Domain had risen from the Human Realm to the Hell level.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen hadn’t expected such a speed of advancement. At that moment, he was doing the math. If he did it a few more times, wouldn’t the Teacher Domain easily advance to the Heaven level?</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t as simple as Zhou Wen imagined. The reason the Teacher Domain could advance from the Human Realm to the Hell level was that Honn Shinsakura’s talent and perceptivity were excellent. He had undergone three epiphanies under the influence of the Teacher Domain, causing his Sword Dao to reach an unbelievable realm. In terms of Sword Dao, even a Heaven-level swordsman wasn’t completely confident of defeating Honn Shinsakura. It could be said that Honn Shinsakura was already a true sword master.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary person with inferior talent and perceptivity, it was hard to say if they could even experience a single epiphany, much less three.</p>
<p>The Teacher Domain could only impart experience and influence perceptivity, but it wasn’t powerful enough to force enlightenment.</p>
<p>It could be said that the Teacher Domain and Honn Shinsakura were mutually fulfilling each other’s wishes. Furthermore, Honn Shinsakura had three epiphanies. Apart from his talent, the immense pressure was also an important reason.</p>
<p>The fate of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace lay on his shoulders, giving him the motivation to exceed his limits. If it were any other time, he might have gained an epiphany once or twice under the influence of the Teacher Domain instead of three times.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be easy for Zhou Wen to use the Teacher Domain to produce such a person.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were many geniuses on Earth. There would be plenty of opportunities in the future. However, Zhou Wen had many geniuses he could use. There was just another problem. Zhou Wen had to have a deep understanding of the Dao they cultivated. Otherwise, the Teacher Domain’s abilities would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>“Come find me after you advance to the Heaven level.” Zhou Wen wasn’t too interested in fighting Mohe.</p>
<p>After the two battles, Zhou Wen had a general understanding of Mohe’s realm. Mohe’s realm was considered very strong among humans, but it was only strong. If he wasn’t at the Calamity grade and didn’t have the shocking ability to deal reflective damage, it was impossible for him to be so famous at his realm.</p>
<p>These words were practically saying to Mohe: “Your abilities aren’t good enough. Go back and train for a few more years.”</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had said those words when he first arrived, even the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace would probably have thought that he was too arrogant and conceited.</p>
<p>However, everyone felt that there was nothing wrong with Zhou Wen’s words. Mohe couldn’t even defeat Honn Shinsakura, who had learned three strikes from Zhou Wen, so how could he be Zhou Wen’s match?</p>
<p>When Mohe heard Zhou Wen, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows slightly. “Perhaps your Sword Dao realm is indeed above mine, but a Sword Dao realm isn’t the only criterion that determines victory.”</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, you are very confident in your ability to reflect damage,” Zhou Wen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Do you dare or not?” Mohe said coldly.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with whether I dare or not. What’s the benefit of fighting you?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What benefits do you want?” Mohe was first taken aback before he asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“If you lose, tell me why you insist on having the Niten Flying Immortal Palace join the Family Clan of Gods,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had always been puzzled by this question. Although the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was not a small faction and Sei Gasakai and Honn Shinsakura were considered elites among humans, they didn’t seem worth the Family Clan of Gods’s attention. At the very least, there was no need for them to pay such a huge price for the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, much less be so insistent.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Mohe hesitated for a moment before agreeing to Zhou Wen’s request.</p>
<p>Since they could no longer recruit the Niten Flying Immortal Palace into the Family Clan of Gods, this secret was meaningless to them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if Zhou Wen knew this secret, he might not be able to obtain any benefits from it.</p>
<p>“Then let’s not waste any time. Let’s begin.” Just as Zhou Wen said that, he gathered the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and struck out at Mohe’s head.</p>
<p>The Calamity Zone condensed by the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was called the Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens. This power could restrain Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability to deal damage-also an ability to reflect damage. Zhou Wen also wanted to know if the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power could restrain Mohe.</p>
<p>When Mohe saw Zhou Wen’s incoming palm strike, he had no intention of dodging. He knew that his Sword Dao realm was inferior to Zhou Wen’s. Instead of wasting time competing in technique, he might as well use his strongest strength to determine the victor.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck Mohe’s head with his palm, producing a dull thud.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1678'>Chapter 1678 Karma Reversal</h3>
<p>The name of Mohe’s Life Providence was Harming Others Without Benefiting Oneself. Previously, it was famous for being a useless Life Providence. If he harmed others, not only would others not be injured, but he would also suffer the same injuries.</p>
<p>This Life Providence had once made Mohe doubt life, but he didn’t sink into depression like the average person would. Instead, he regained his confidence and firmly believed that there was no crippled Life Providence in the world, only crippled people. He definitely could find a way to use his Life Providence.</p>
<p>However, after trying one method after another, none of them met with success.</p>
<p>Mohe had also thought that perhaps his Life Soul had some special attribute that could reverse the disadvantage of his Life Providence and even turn the disadvantage into an advantage.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t happen. His Life Soul was equally weak and he was similarly unable to harm others.</p>
<p>When humans finally found a way to advance to the Mythical stage, Mohe placed his hopes on the Wheel of Destiny. He thought that the Wheel of Destiny could change everything.</p>
<p>Likewise, it didn’t. His Wheel of Destiny was actually the same type. He still couldn’t harm anyone.</p>
<p>Even someone as mentally resilient as Mohe was about to break down. Although he was a member of the Family Clan of Gods, he was a cripple. He didn’t obtain many resources. He had already paid a significant price to reach the Mythical stage.</p>
<p>No matter how many resources his family had, it was impossible for them to help him advance to the Terror grade.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t blame the family. He felt that it was fair. If it were him, he wouldn’t invest the resources on a hopeless person either.</p>
<p>Just as Mohe had given up hope, he never expected the dimension’s Fallen race to find him and help him advance to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>When Mohe’s Life Providence advanced to the Terror grade and entered the Terror form, it finally underwent a reversal. Just as he had imagined, it turned the disadvantage into an advantage.</p>
<p>His Terror form was called Karma Reversal. Under the effects of the Terror form, he went from harming others without benefiting himself to harming others to benefit himself. His Life Soul and Wheel of Destiny also became extremely powerful.</p>
<p>When he advanced to the Calamity grade, he could finally freely control his strength and no longer be restrained by all sorts of restrictions. Not only could he injure others, but anyone who harmed him in his domain would also suffer a karma reversal, causing the enemy to be injured instead. Furthermore, this kind of injury would be reflected multiple times over.</p>
<p>Mohe knew his abilities very well. Even if Zhou Wen’s level was higher than his and his strength was greater than his, it was still impossible for him to defeat him. The stronger Zhou Wen was, the more miserable his defeat would be.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen struck Mohe on the head. Just as Mohe was considering if he should take this opportunity to eliminate Zhou Wen, he suddenly felt his head buzz. His mind went blank as his body fell forward uncontrollably and slammed to the ground. Then, an intense pain spread throughout his body as the sound of bones shattering constantly sounded.</p>
<p>Mohe was slammed to the ground by Zhou Wen. As his body twisted and sank into the ground, all his bones fractured as blood seeped out of his seven orifices.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible…” Mohe’s irises constricted as he struggled to get up. However, he realized that his arm and leg bones had snapped into several pieces. He couldn’t control them at all. He couldn’t even move, much less stand up. The intense pain pulsed through his nerves.</p>
<p>On the distant ship, the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace fell dead silent. Everyone gaped as they stared blankly at Zhou Wen and Mohe, who had been slammed into the concrete ground.</p>
<p>For a moment, they suspected if this was the real Mohe. Perhaps this Mohe was only a replica and a weak imposter. Otherwise, how could he have been smacked to the ground by Zhou Wen and not be able to get up?</p>
<p>He was Mohe, the Mohe who had appeared virtually invincible on the Cube. Even a Calamity-grade dimensional creature had been casually killed by him. There was no need for him to do anything. If a Calamity creature attacked him, they would be killed by this Fallen race representative’s recoil.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Mohe had previously killed hundreds of Companion Beasts with one hand and if it wasn’t for the fact that Mohe had just defeated Sei Gasakai with one strike, they would have no doubt that he was a useless imposter.</p>
<p>But now, they looked at Zhou Wen with eyes filled with zeal and respect.</p>
<p>This was the true peak combat strength of humanity. Without becoming a representative or relying on a Guardian, his strength had reached an unbelievable level.</p>
<p>After casually teaching Honn Shinsakura three strikes, he allowed Honn Shinsakura to defeat Mohe in terms of sword techniques. With a casual palm strike, he slammed the invisible Mohe to the ground. How terrifying was this existence?</p>
<p>“Master, is he really pure human?” Even Shiraishi Satomi, who knew Zhou Wen’s identity, found it difficult to believe the truth she knew.</p>
<p>To be able to smack down Mohe with a single slap, how powerful was this force? Shiraishi Satomi found it difficult to believe that pure humans could reach this stage.</p>
<p>After all, before Zhou Wen was born, no human could advance to the Mythical stage as a pure-blooded human, much less slap a Calamity-grade existence to the ground.</p>
<p>“Some people are born different,” Sei Gasakai said with a sigh.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen was like a god in the eyes of the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the struggling Mohe, who couldn’t stand up, and was somewhat surprised. He never expected the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power to restrain Mohe. It was even stronger than he imagined.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen soon understood the reason. He had the Hell-level Teacher Domain constantly activated. The effects of the Teacher Domain were now even stronger than before.</p>
<p>During the entire process of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power resisting Mohe’s power, the effects of the Teacher Domain were completely unleashed due to Mohe’s power being restrained. The Teacher Domain had already deduced the rules of Mohe’s power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already understood the rules of Mohe’s power. He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. Mohe sure is unlucky. This power of Karma Reversal can gain the upper hand against any powerful force. However, the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s domain power is a form of sacrificial power. Human Sovereign sacrificed himself to the heavens to fulfill the wishes of others. When it’s used on him, what’s originally a saving power becomes a force of destruction thanks to his Karma Reversal powers.</p>
<p>It was only because Zhou Wen was just giving it a try from the beginning that he didn’t dare use all his strength. He was afraid that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power couldn’t injure Mohe and he would suffer the consequences. If he had used all his strength, he would probably have killed Mohe.</p>
<p>“Get someone to take him back.” Zhou Wen wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, nor was there any reason for him to kill Mohe.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they might have imagined that Mohe was an enemy and wanted to eliminate him as soon as possible. However, Zhou Wen stood at a different vantage point.</p>
<p>In particular, the few conversations he had had with his teacher, Wang Mingyuan, made Zhou Wen realize very clearly that his enemy wasn’t humans or these representatives, but the terrifying dimension. These representatives might become humanity’s hope and main combat strength in the future. This was also why he didn’t object to Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu becoming representatives.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1679'>Chapter 1679 My Adversary Has Never Been Humanity</h3>
<p>“You aren’t killing me?” Mohe asked in surprise. He never expected Zhou Wen to get someone to take him back and not kill him.</p>
<p>Others might be afraid of the Family Clan of Gods’ faction and wouldn’t dare attack him because of their qualms, but Mohe knew very well that the An family had no intention of compromising with the Family Clan of Gods. Even if the An family was willing to compromise, an existence like Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry about the Family Clan of Gods.</p>
<p>“Why should I kill you?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.</p>
<p>Mohe was first taken aback before saying, “Because I’m your enemy now.”</p>
<p>“My enemies have never been humans.” With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and walked towards Honn Shinsakura.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhou Wen’s back, Mohe’s expression changed constantly. He kept thinking about Zhou Wen’s words: “My enemies have never been humans.” He didn’t know what to feel.</p>
<p>Honn Shinsakura got two disciples to take Mohe back before leading the remaining disciples to Guide Ancient City with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Elders who were unwilling to migrate to Guide Ancient City were now overjoyed. They would occasionally appear in front of Zhou Wen and greet him Mr. Zhou warmly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in a rather good mood. He originally imagined that it would be a tiring trip that wasted his time, but he never expected to find a way to advance the Teacher Domain. He was already planning to try it on Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen to see if he could raise the Teacher Domain to the Heaven level when he returned.</p>
<p>He used spatial teleportation abilities on his trip here. It didn’t take much time, but when he returned, he had to slowly travel with more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. It wasn’t that fast.</p>
<p>As the route they chose was relatively safe, they didn’t encounter much trouble along the way. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to take action to resolve the minor problems they encountered. Honn Shinsakura and company resolved them themselves, so Zhou Wen had nothing to do.</p>
<p>He wanted to grind the game dungeons, but his phone was still charging. There was no way to operate it.</p>
<p>The charging took longer than Zhou Wen had anticipated. After more than fifty hours, the phone’s battery finally reached 99%. It was just short of the final 1%.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his phone and waited for the final 1% to be completed. He was very curious about the difference after the phone was charged up.</p>
<p>Ordinary phones were charged for extended usage, but the mysterious phone had no need for that. Changes were definitely in stall from the charging.</p>
<p>Ding! With a notification sound, the battery reached 100%. As Zhou Wen waited in anticipation, the phone screen finally changed.</p>
<p>The battery icon vanished and the screen turned black. A line of white words appeared in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>“Fully charged. Restarting system…”</p>
<p>Restart? Why isn’t it an upgrade? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He imagined that there would be a tremendous change, but he never expected it to only be a restart.</p>
<p>The phone didn’t make Zhou Wen wait too long. After a while, the line of words vanished. The phone screen lit up again and entered the familiar home screen.</p>
<p>Looking at the familiar scene, Zhou Wen swiped his finger a few times, but he didn’t discover any obvious differences. Even the background was the same. The icon of every game dungeon was identical.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me this thing is really just charging for extended usage? Zhou Wen was depressed. After all this trouble, it really didn’t seem any different.</p>
<p>He flipped it back and forth several times. Apart from the game dungeon icons representing dungeons that had already been downloaded, nothing had increased. No matter how he looked at it, it was identical to before.</p>
<p>Unwilling to give up, he studied it for a while longer before he was completely disappointed. The mysterious phone hadn’t changed at all.</p>
<p>Are you messing with me? Zhou Wen felt depressed, but there was nothing he could do. He randomly opened the Ant City dungeon. Having not grinded dungeons for a few days, he planned on grinding the dungeon to see if he could obtain anything useful. I wonder if the drop rate will be higher after it’s fully charged. It can’t be completely useless, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself as he suddenly froze when he saw the Ant City dungeon.</p>
<p>After clicking on the icon, he didn’t enter the game like before. Instead, two options appeared.</p>
<p>Normal mode… Hidden mode… I knew it was impossible for there to be no changes… Could this be the legendary hidden dungeon? Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he saw the two options. He chose the hidden mode without any hesitation.</p>
<p>In the past, there would always be some hidden places. Even if one cleared the game, it was very likely that they wouldn’t discover the hidden mysterious dungeons. Typically, one had to use special methods to enter.</p>
<p>Hidden dungeons often had all sorts of hidden bosses and treasures. There might even be a drop rate that was much higher than ordinary dungeons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only imagined the scene of him casually killing a few dimensional creatures after entering a hidden dungeon and having Companion Eggs and Essence Energy Crystals drop. He couldn’t contain his excitement.</p>
<p>If he was lucky, he might be able to drop a divine artifact just by killing a monster. Just the thought of it was thrilling.</p>
<p>The Ant City dungeon was a dungeon that came with the phone. It was also the first dungeon Zhou Wen had come into contact with. However, Zhou Wen had yet to kill the Guardian of Ant City.</p>
<p>This Guardian could actually become stronger and stronger with time. This was considered a unique existence.</p>
<p>After entering Ant City, the game screen didn’t seem to change. The ant-type dimensional creatures didn’t show any signs of becoming stronger. With Zhou Wen’s present strength, he could easily kill a large group with one strike.</p>
<p>Soon, he arrived at the ant nest. Just as Zhou Wen was about to rush into the huge hive where the Golden Ant King was, he suddenly saw a strange glow appear on the game screen.</p>
<p>Although it was called Ant City, it was actually a huge cave with many ant nests inside. In the past, Zhou Wen had always cleared the ant nests before fighting the Ant City Guardian.</p>
<p>The layout of the cave and the ant nest didn’t change, but at the deepest part of the cave, there was a mountain wall that shimmered with golden light.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked carefully and realized that there was a protruding rock on the shimmering mountain wall. The rock was only the size of a palm and it curved slightly. The color and texture were no different from ordinary rocks.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that the rock was glowing with golden light, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have noticed it no matter how many times he came.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stopped provoking the ant colony in Ant City. He summoned the Invisibility Cloak and wore it. He secretly came in front of the golden rocks and reached out to touch them.</p>
<p>The rock itself didn’t seem strange. It was no different from the rocks beside it. It was unlikely to be a treasure.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to explore. When he exerted strength with his hand to attempt spinning the rock, it began moving. Then, there was a grinding sound as the rock sank into the mountain wall. Then, a crack that could allow a person to pass opened up on the mountain wall.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1680'>Chapter 1680 Golden Demonic Ant King</h3>
<p>The crack was filled with golden light, making it impossible to see what was inside. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on observing as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter the crack.</p>
<p>The golden light outside looked resplendent, but it was like a thin layer of ripples. After passing through the golden light, he found a cave inside.</p>
<p>The cave was rather large, and the space was similar to a factory’s warehouse. However, there was no sign of dimensional creatures in the huge cave. There was only a huge egg-shaped object carved from gold on a stone platform.</p>
<p>It was golden in color and looked like 24K gold. It was more than a meter tall and nearly a meter wide. It looked fat and there were many strange patterns on it. The patterns were bent and curved in an unidentifiable manner. Or perhaps it wasn’t a pattern at all, but natural patterns.</p>
<p>Is this a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen reached out to stroke the golden egg as a message immediately appeared on his phone.</p>
<p>ne</p>
<p>Golden Demonic Ant King: Mortal (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Strength: 11</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 11</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 11</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Golden Guardian, Demonization, Ant Strength God, King Transformation</p>
<p>Companion Form: Golden Battle Armor</p>
<p>An evolvable Companion Beast! Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd. This thing was equivalent to a free pick up. Furthermore, from its skills, it was both a king and a demon. It seemed rather powerful.</p>
<p>If every dimensional zone had such a hidden spot, wouldn’t he be able to pick up divine pets everywhere?</p>
<p>With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t contain his joy as he hatched the Golden Demonic Ant King. Without looking at its appearance, he eagerly exited the Ant City dungeon and chose the Big Dipper instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Ant City could only be considered a low-level game dungeon. Apart from the Ant City Guardian, the other dimensional creatures’ levels were pitifully low.</p>
<p>If such dungeons had evolvable Companion Beasts, what would be the treasure hidden in a high-level dungeon like the Big Dipper? Just the thought of it excited Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Of course, there were some higher-level dungeons. Although there might be better things hidden in places like Chess Mountain, Zhou Wen couldn’t clear those places yet. He couldn’t enter any random place.</p>
<p>If the hidden dungeon was somewhere Zhou Wen couldn’t reach, it was useless even if he entered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could already clear the seven Star Palaces in the Big Dipper instance dungeon. No matter where the hidden dungeon was, he could find it. He planned on experimenting with it.</p>
<p>He eagerly opened the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Just like before, there were two options-ordinary and hidden. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to choose the hidden mode.</p>
<p>After entering the first Star Palace, he didn’t find any traces of the hidden dungeon. Zhou Wen had no choice but to storm through one Star Palace after another, but he was disappointed again and again. He killed six Star Palace Starlords without finding any traces of the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s definitely in the last Star Palace. At this moment, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he teleported into the final Star Palace.</p>
<p>The Alkaid Star Palace was the Star Palace where Starlord Army Breaker was. It was the last of the seven Star Palaces of the Big Dipper. In front of the Star Palace was a long staircase that drained all Essence Energy. Only the power of the Teacher Domain could restrain the taboo power.</p>
<p>If one didn’t have the ability of the Teacher Domain, they would lose all their Essence Energy before reaching the Star Palace. No matter how strong a powerhouse was, they would only be killed by Starlord Army Breaker.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen, Starlord Army Breaker was the easiest to kill.</p>
<p>In front of the stairs, he didn’t find any traces of the hidden dungeon. Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain and walked into the Star Palace, killing Starlord Army Breaker with one strike. Unfortunately, only some Essence Energy Crystals dropped. He didn’t find any Companion Eggs or skill crystals.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t care about this at all today. He didn’t even look at the Essence Energy Crystals on the ground because he realized that there was a spot shimmering with an ice-blue light in Alkaid Star Palace.</p>
<p>Alkaid Star Palace was a miniature outer space. At the top of the curved Star Palace, there were many stars shimmering. It should have been filled with starlight, but now, there was a star that shimmered with a dazzling ice-blue light that outshined the other stars. The other stars appeared dim, and only one star independently shimmered with an ice-blue glow.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the mini star that shimmered with an ice-blue glow in the corner was likely the key spot to the hidden dungeon. Zhou Wen flew and quickly arrived in front of the mini star.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know how to activate the hidden dungeon, it was only a matter of time once he found the key spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen studied it for a while. When he spun the mini star, it immediately emitted a dazzling ice-blue beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was given a fright as he instant transmitted into the distance. He realized that the ice-blue beam wasn’t directed at him, but at the Army Breaker Star Palace’s teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>The teleportation nexus was immediately dyed ice-blue. Starlight threads shimmered with ice-blue light, completely different from the usual activation.</p>
<p>This was the last Star Palace. Usually, through this teleportation nexus, one would be teleported out of the Big Dipper Palaces. Now, it looked like it was connected to a completely different world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked into the teleportation nexus and the teleportation nexus that emitted a blue glow immediately activated, teleporting him out of Alkaid Star Palace.</p>
<p>After a bout of vertigo, the scene in front of Zhou Wen became clearer. He couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw it.</p>
<p>It was another Star Palace—a Star Palace built from ice. It was propped up by huge ice pillars. There were doorways, but there were no doors. At a glance, one could see a Starlord wearing ice armor standing in the middle of the huge Ice Palace.</p>
<p>The Starlord stood on the ice platform, her figure tall and straight. Her head was slightly raised, and her eyes seemed to be looking up at the sky under a black ice mask. Her hands were crossed on the hilt of a black ice sword, and the tip of the black ice sword was stabbed into the ice platform.</p>
<p>From her curvy figure that even her armor couldn’t hide, she was undoubtedly a Starlady. However, she exuded the presence of a monarch, making one have the urge to bow and worship her.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar! Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed when he saw the Starlady’s name in-game. His expression changed.</p>
<p>This name wasn’t unfamiliar to Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Previously, the antelope had tricked him into carrying a huge log to Forbidden City. However, when he arrived, he realized that the log was a coffin for the living. The sleeping person inside was Starlady Polestar, and she had nearly killed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>That Starlady Polestar was a Guardian. Zhou Wen imagined that it might just be the same name. There shouldn’t be any relationship between the two.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, Zhou Wen realized that he was wrong.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1681'>Chapter 1681: White Dragon’s Ghost</h3>
<p>When Starlady Polestar slowly looked down at Zhou Wen, starlight appeared in the ice palace like stars that filled the sky. It was the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array that Zhou Wen was very familiar with.</p>
<p>Back then, Zhou Wen had imitated Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle</p>
<p>Stellar Array and created the Minor Heavenly Cycle Array.</p>
<p>With just a glance, Zhou Wen’s hair stood on end as he summoned the Hell-level Chaos Egg to protect his body.</p>
<p>It was because he was so familiar with the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array that Zhou Wen knew how terrifying the starlight was.</p>
<p>The one in Forbidden City was already very terrifying. This person’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array didn’t seem much different, but the power inside made Zhou Wen’s heart palpitate.</p>
<p>Just as the Chaos Egg was summoned, the sky was filled with starlight. Endless starlight shone on the Chaos Egg, and the entire Star Palace was drowned by starlight.</p>
<p>The Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg rapidly increased. A Hell-level Chaos Egg could combine 100 million Essence Energy Crystals into one. Even so, it was still difficult to contain the rapidly produced Essence Energy.</p>
<p>In just a few seconds, the Hell-level Chaos Egg exploded. The blood-colored avatar exposed to the starlight was instantly killed by it.</p>
<p>What’s this? It’s definitely a Heaven -level existence. Isn’t a hidden dungeon a place to pick up free treasures? Why is there such a thing? Zhou Wen looked at the black screen as his mind was filled with question marks.</p>
<p>The treasure picking plan that he had originally planned didn’t seem to work now. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and had a new guess about the hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen suspected that the reason there were no dimensional creatures in Ant City’s hidden dungeon and only one Companion Egg was very likely because it was a dungeon that came with a phone. It was equivalent to a tutorial dungeon, and the Golden Demonic Ant King Companion Egg was an existence akin to a beginner’s starter pack.</p>
<p>If it were under normal circumstances, Zhou Wen would have had the portable charger from the begmning and would have obtained the Golden Demonic Ant King Companion Beast, but unfortunately, he had only obtained the phone and not the portable charger. That was why he had missed the starter pack.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen seriously suspected that other than Ant City’s hidden dungeon, it wasn’t easy to benefit from the other hidden dungeons.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to confirm this guess. Zhou Wen restarted a new dungeon. This time, he activated a low-level Dragon Gate Grotto dungeon.</p>
<p>It was as Zhou Wen had guessed. When he found the hidden dungeon in Dragon Gate Grotto, he realized that the hidden dungeon was none other than the Dragon’s Well that Wang Mingyuan had used to mutate.</p>
<p>In that case, these hidden dungeons also exist in reality, but some of them haven’t been discovered?Another thought flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, even if he knew the location of the hidden dungeon in reality, it didn’t seem to be of much use. After all, he could grind the hidden dungeon in-game.</p>
<p>That’s not right! Zhou Wen quickly realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>This was because he had previously thought of entering Ant City’s hidden dungeon again to see if he could obtain another Golden Demonic Ant King Companion Egg, but there was nothing inside.</p>
<p>In other words, it was very likely that the things in the hidden dungeon wouldn’t respawn, or the respawning would be very slow. Then, knowing the location of the hidden dungeon in reality became very important.</p>
<p>After clearing a hidden dungeon in-game, he could also do it in real life. This was equivalent to obtaining the rewards of two hidden dungeons.</p>
<p>Just like the white dragon in Dragon’s Well, the white dragon in real life had been fused by Wang Mingyuan, but there was still a white dragon in-game.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen only needed to kill the white dragon to see if it would respawn again to know if his guess was wrong.</p>
<p>The white dragon had an ice-elemental attribute, and it was at the Terror grade. It was almost invincible to Zhou Wen back when he was in school, but now, he could view it in derision.</p>
<p>Seeing the white dragon spew out a surging ice fog, Zhou Wen threw a punch over as his powerful Essence Energy sent the ice fog tumbling backward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen origmally imagined that the Terror-grade white dragon would only be killed if his punch landed on it.</p>
<p>However, the outcome surprised Zhou Wen. After he killed the white dragon with one punch, its body shattered like a heavily damaged ice block. It looked like it was dead.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see the white dragon with his eyes, but within Truth</p>
<p>Listener’s ability, he outlined a white dragon’s figure in his mind. It was still in its origmal spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a closer look and used some skills that enhanced his vision. He even used Doctor Darkness’s Eyes of Penetration, but he still couldn’t see the white dragon.</p>
<p>After dispelling Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear anything even if he used his ears. It was as though there was nothing there.</p>
<p>The other Companion Beasts that enhanced hearing found it difficult to discover the white dragon’s figure. Only Truth Listener’s ability could discover its existence. It was as though the white dragon’s figure was a ghost. Ordinary people couldn’t see ghosts at all. Only people with Yin Yang Eyes could.</p>
<p>What’s this? Dimensional creatures can end up as ghosts? Zhou Wen looked at the shattered white dragon’s body and found it odder.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was still pondering over it, the ghost-like white dragon moved and charged at him.</p>
<p>It moved silently without causing any spatial fluctuations—like a ghost. Apart from Truth Listener’s ability, no other power could discover the white dragon’s existence.</p>
<p>Even the Teacher Domain couldn’t discover it. Zhou Wen had tried all sorts of other powers, but he couldn’t discover it when the white dragon moved.</p>
<p>However, when the white dragon approached Zhou Wen, he felt his heart palpitate.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s present strength, even if he stood still, it was impossible for ordinary Terror creatures to severely injure him. Now, this white dragon had made him react instinctively to danger. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was only in-game. Zhou Wen didn’t need to dodge. He wanted to see what the Terror-grade white dragon could do to him.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had another thought deep down. However, even he didn’t dare to face it. He wanted to know what abilities the white dragon had. This was because Wang Mingyuan had fused with the white dragon, so he naturally had its abilities.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was so strong that it was almost comparable to a Human Realm Calamity creature. In theory, it was very difficult for a Terror-grade creature to deal a destructive blow to him.</p>
<p>The white dragon rushed in front of Zhou Wen, but it passed through his body like a real ghost without leaving any injuries.</p>
<p>However, when the white dragon completely passed through Zhou Wen’s body, the blood-colored avatar suddenly collapsed to the ground as the game screen went black.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1682'>Chapter 1682 Exquisite Nine Orifices</h3>
<p>What’s that? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although his true level was at the Terror grade, a Terror-grade creature that was capable of killing him was truly rare.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that other than Truth Listener, no other ability could see it. That was what made it most terrifying.</p>
<p>If the enemy had such an ability, wouldn’t they be able to kill anyone they wanted? Ignoring the fact that it was difficult to guard against them while sleeping, even if they weren’t sleeping and had their eyes wide open, they would still be silently killed. They wouldn’t even know how they died.</p>
<p>Even an ability like the Teacher Domain that could analyze the rules of various powers couldn’t sense the existence of that thing. This was a little terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to enter Dragon Gate Grotto again, wanting to figure out what it was. After entering the dungeon again, the white dragon returned to its original appearance. It didn’t seem to have really died and become a ghost. The ghost-like form was likely its ability.</p>
<p>After killing the white dragon again, the spectral white dragon appeared again. Just like the last time, it silently charged at Zhou Wen. This time, Zhou Wen chose to dodge.</p>
<p>The spectral white dragon’s speed was naturally inferior to Zhou Wen’s. It chased after Zhou Wen, but it couldn’t keep up with his speed.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen dodged, he observed the white dragon and realized that it didn’t seem to have the ability to use other skills in such a strange state. All it did was constantly attempt to burrow into Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>He summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to face the spectral white dragon, but Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t see it at all. Even under Zhou Wen’s orders, Tyrant Behemoth used all its strength to strike the spectral white dragon only to hit air. As for the spectral white dragon, it passed through Tyrant Behemoth’s body like passing through a wall. Tyrant Behemoth immediately died and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen saw it clearly. At the instant the spectral white dragon passed through Tyrant Behemoth’s body, it transformed into a humanoid spectral creature.</p>
<p>This thing looks very similar to Teacher’s appearance… Zhou Wen looked at the spectral creature and realized that it was 70% similar to Wang Mingyuan’s appearance after his mutation. However, it looked more inhuman than Wang Mingyuan. Instead, it looked like the legendary Dracotaur. It had a dragon head and a human body. It was extremely strange. The spectral creature maintained its Dracotaur form for a short period of time. Not long after passing through Tyrant Behemoth’s body, it transformed back into the spectral white dragon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen made some more attempts and realized that all sorts of Companion Beasts would die on the spot if the spectral white dragon passed through their bodies. They weren’t injured at all; it was as though their souls had been taken away.</p>
<p>Every time the spectral white dragon took a Companion Beast’s life, it would take on a Dracotaur form.</p>
<p>After making some more attempts, he realized that other than Truth Listener, no other force could injure it in its spectral white dragon form. However, in its Dracotaur form, there were some forces that could injure it.</p>
<p>For example, the power of the Dao Sutra and Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra could cause damage to it when it was in its Dracotaur form.</p>
<p>What a strange ability. After all sorts of tests, Zhou Wen had a comprehensive understanding of the spectral creature. He immediately used the power of the Dao Sutra to shatter it with a punch.</p>
<p>‘Killed a Terror creature, Nine Orifices Exquisite Dragon. Discovered Essence Energy Crystal…’</p>
<p>‘Killed a Terror Guardian, Realm Crosser…’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly at the notification on his phone. He wasn’t in the mood to even look at the items that had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Could it be that the Guardian parasitized the Exquisite Nine Orifices Dragon… Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind. He was certain that Wang Mingyuan had likely fused with the Realm Crosser.</p>
<p>He looked down at the items that had fallen to the ground and realized that other than Essence Energy Crystals, there was something else that Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>It was something that resembled ice and crystal. Its shape was extremely irregular, like a heart or a skull. However, they didn’t look like one either. On the ice crystal-like object were nine different-sized holes.</p>
<p>This item’s name in-game was ‘Exquisite Nine Orifices.’ Zhou Wen picked it up and carefully read its information.</p>
<p>Exquisite Nine Orifices: Able to clear up Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen recognized these words, but he didn’t know what they meant when they were strung together.</p>
<p>Does clearing up here mean clearing some aperture in the body, or does it mean something like clearing doubts in the form of an epiphany? Zhou Wen only knew of the enlightenment meaning commonly used among humans.</p>
<p>However, that usually meant that a person was too slow and couldn’t learn anything. One day, it was as though they had suddenly figured out something. They could learn anything with just some simple instructions.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t guess the exact effects of using this phrase on a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>If it was just to make Companion Beasts smart, it didn’t seem to be of much use to Zhou Wen. This was because to him, most Companion Beasts were just tools. He could control Companion Beasts to fight without needing them to be too smart. Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s main Companion Beasts were basically highly intelligent. There was no need for them to become smarter.</p>
<p>After searching the hidden dungeon, he didn’t find anything else. He was almost certain that this Exquisite Nine Orifices was the reward for this hidden dungeon.</p>
<p>The items in-game had to be used in-game and couldn’t be taken out of the game. If he left them in-game, he was afraid that they would be gone after the dungeon respawned. Zhou Wen had no choice but to decide which Companion Beast to use the Exquisite Nine Orifices with.</p>
<p>I’ll show it to Neonate. Zhou Wen wanted to summon Demonic Neonate, but he couldn’t. Only then did he recall that Demonic Neonate was still evolving and couldn’t be summoned.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was something that unlocked intelligence, Zhou Wen still had a choice. It was to use it on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. The fellow was like a machine that only knew how to kill. Its intelligence didn’t seem to be high, so if it could become smarter, it would definitely be even more terrifying</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s stats and skills were ultimately a thorn in Zhou Wen’s heart, so it was best not to use it on him.</p>
<p>Demonic Neonate is evolving. I can forget about the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Then, who should I use it on? Zhou Wen thought of his Companion Beasts and finally summoned Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s intelligence wasn’t low, but it couldn’t speak the entire time. Therefore, it gave off the feeling that its intelligence wasn’t high.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t sure what the Exquisite Nine Orifices was for. Furthermore, he didn’t have any Companion Beasts that he especially wanted to improve. Giving it to Truth Listener was a pretty good choice.</p>
<p>Upon receiving Zhou Wen’s order, Truth Listener swallowed the Exquisite Nine Orifices. Then, golden light suddenly erupted from its body as the six earrings on its ears began to shatter.</p>
<p>Is the effect that strong? Zhou Wen was given a fright. He hadn’t let Truth Listener shatter the earrings for a long time. Now that all six earrings had been destroyed, it would be terrible if something happened.</p>
<p>The only thing he was glad about was that they were in-game. Even if something really happened, it wouldn’t affect Truth Listener in real life.</p>
<p>If all six earrings were destroyed in reality, Truth Listener even had the risk of escaping Zhou Wen’s control. This had happened before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared intently at the phone screen as he watched Truth Listener’s body transform into a terrifying golden ape after the earrings shattered. Golden light erupted from its body as a violent aura nearly tore out of the screen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1683'>Chapter 1683 Heaven 999</h3>
<p>As the golden light intensified, the golden ape’s body shrank and its body gradually transformed into a human.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen Truth Listener’s form before. It felt somewhat similar to the Super Saiyan transformation of a certain protagonist in a particular comic.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener in that state was almost about to escape Zhou Wen’s control and his Companion Beast team.</p>
<p>Now, Truth Listener had once again transformed into the wild, blonde, handsome warrior form. Perhaps it was because of the game, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the loss of connection with Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Even though all six earrings had shattered and he had transformed into a human, his connection with Truth Listener was still very clear. It wasn’t as indiscernible as when he summoned Truth Listener in reality.</p>
<p>Above Truth Listener’s head, nine strange beams of light spewed out. They looked like nine holes, but in fact, it was only because the light source was too intense that it gave off an illusion.</p>
<p>The nine spots of light corresponded to the nine holes in the nine orifices.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The nine spots on his head glowed brightly at the same time, like the final eruption of a volcano. The light was so blinding that Zhou Wen could hardly open his eyes. All he could hear was Truth Listener’s painful roar.</p>
<p>After the light gradually weakened, Zhou Wen saw the scene in-game again.</p>
<p>Truth Listener, who had transformed into a blonde, wild, and handsome man, stood there, being half a head taller than Zhou Wen. He looked somewhat sinister, but his eyes were surprisingly gentle as though he was looking at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>This feeling was very magical. In the past, when Zhou Wen used Truth Listener, he was always worried. It wasn’t because he was afraid that it would hit him, but because he was afraid that it would sever ties with him. This was the first time he had seen Truth Listener standing in front of him with its full power unleashed with every earring shattered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened Truth Listener’s information window and checked its stats and level.</p>
<p>Truth Listener: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Heaven’s Senses</p>
<p>Life Soul: Evil Nullification</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Nirvana of Ultimate Hell</p>
<p>Terror Form: Holy Evil (S-grade)</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Evil Breaker (Heaven level)</p>
<p>Strength: 999</p>
<p>Speed: 999</p>
<p>Constitution: 999</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 999</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Vajra Body, Evil Warding, Nine Extremes</p>
<p>Companion Form: Earring</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, Heaven-level stats actually reach 999! Zhou Wen wore an envious look as he was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>He had yet to advance to the Calamity grade, and his stats were at 99. At the Human Realm, he could break through to 100 points and reach a maximum of 199.</p>
<p>The lowest stats in the Hell level were 200, and the highest was unknown to Zhou Wen. He guessed that it was 400 or 399, but 999 stats of the Heaven level were terrifying.</p>
<p>If Starlady Polestar’s stats were the same, it wouldn’t be strange for her to blast through the Hell-level Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen felt that such stats weren’t something every Companion Beast could achieve. After all, many Companion Beasts had limited talent. They might not be able to advance to the Heaven level. Even if they advanced to the Heaven level, their stats might not be maxed out.</p>
<p>From Zhou Wen’s point of view, 999 stats should be the maximum stats at the Heaven level. He guessed that Demonic Neonate would probably have such stats when she advanced to the Heaven level. It was hard to say for the other Companion Beasts. Although they were all evolvable Companion Beasts, there were definitely differences.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wanted to try summoning Truth Listener in reality, but when he thought of the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace beside him, he decided against it.</p>
<p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Wen exited the Ant City dungeon and launched the Big Dipper instance dungeon. He wanted to see if the Heaven-level Truth Listener could defeat Starlady Polestar.</p>
<p>How strong will the Heaven-level Truth Listener be? Zhou Wen was already eager to see Truth Listener’s ability.</p>
<p>When facing Starlord Ravenous Wolf, Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and released its strongest human form.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf threw a punch as a terrifying blast of light illuminated the entire Star Palace.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a casual punch from Truth Listener, Starlord Ravenous Wolf and half the Star Palace exploded. Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open for a long time as he looked at the wrecked Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>This is too f*cking violent! Zhou Wen muttered inwardly as his face bloomed with joy.</p>
<p>Starlord Titan Gate was instantly killed. Zhou Wen originally imagined that Starlord Cherished Kismet, who had the ability to reflect damage, might cause trouble for a pure Strength-type Companion Beast like Truth Listener, or that Zhou Wen had to do it himself.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen was still thinking that although Truth Listener was strong, it had to rely on its owner to clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon under the effects of mutual augmentation and suppression.</p>
<p>However, the outcome left Zhou Wen flabbergasted. Truth Listener blasted apart Starlord Cherished Kismet with a single punch. Reflective damage? Not supposed to clash head-on? That was all nonsense. In front of the violent Truth Listener, there was nothing that couldn’t be resolved with a single punch.</p>
<p>If there was one, another punch would do the trick.</p>
<p>Starlord Merciful Song, Starlord Ardent Virtue and Starlord Martial Song were instantly killed. The staircase in front of the Army Breaker Star Palace that could make one lose their Essence Energy failed to stop Truth Listener’s footsteps. There was no need for Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain powers to restrain the taboo powers.</p>
<p>Truth Listener casually walked up to the Army Breaker Star Palace and blasted Army Breaker to pieces with another punch.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen finally saw what it meant to defeat everything with one force. Truth Listener didn’t have many strange abilities, but its strength was practically invincible.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Wen wasn’t naive enough to believe that Truth Listener’s pure strength was that powerful. The reason why Truth Listener’s pure strength was strong was also under the premise that it had abilities like Evil Nullification, Holy Evil, Evil Breaker, and Evil Warding. Due to the existence of these abilities, he could fight with his strength without any worries without being restrained by some strange powers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it wouldn’t be that easy to clear Starlord Cherished Kismet’s level with strength alone.</p>
<p>Following behind Truth Listener, Zhou Wen’s only role was to use the teleportation nexus to enter the next Star Palace. After killing Army Breaker, he activated the hidden teleportation nexus that led to the hidden North Pole Star Palace.</p>
<p>Such a powerful Truth Listener shouldn’t be weaker than Starlady Polestar, right? When he arrived in front of the ice palace again, Zhou Wen felt somewhat uneasy as he looked at Starlady Polestar standing in the palace with her sword pressed to the ground.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was indeed very strong, but Starlady Polestar wasn’t weak either. An existence that could blast apart a Hell-level Chaos Egg definitely couldn’t be underestimated</p>
<p>Sensing Zhou Wen and Truth Listener’s arrival, Starlady Polestar slowly lowered her head and looked at them. At the same time, dazzling starlight began to rise from her body. The entire Star Palace seemed to transform into an endless sea of stars. The starlight that filled the sky shone at Zhou Wen and company, making them feel like they were in a sea of starlight.</p>
<p>Truth Listener stood in front of Zhou Wen as the golden light over its body shimmered like an electric current. Its feral golden eyes seemed to pass through thousands of stars and collide with Starlady Polestar’s gaze.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1684'>Chapter 1684 Don’t Be a Burden</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg to protect his body. In such a battle, all he needed to do was protect himself and not become Truth Listener’s burden.</p>
<p>Thousands of starlight beams intertwined and poured down. It was unimaginably terrifying. Probably the end of the world could match this.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s entire body emitted golden light as it raised its head to face the infinite starlight. It had no intention of dodging or defending. Its legs suddenly exerted strength as its body shot into the sky like a cannonball.</p>
<p>“You f*cked me over!” Zhou Wen let out a tragic cry.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener was a pure Strength-type Companion Beast and didn’t have the ability to release its Strength, just the fluctuations produced when its strength broke through space sent Zhou Wen flying. The Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg crazily crystallized.</p>
<p>Before he could resist the starlight, the Chaos Egg was already half-filled. The Chaos Egg kept tumbling from the tremors, making Zhou Wen curse inwardly. He swore that he had to stay away from Truth Listener in future battles.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The random thoughts were still in Zhou Wen’s mind when he heard a terrifying explosion. Truth Listener was facing the starlight of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array head-on. Countless starlight intertwined on his body like laser slicing blades.</p>
<p>The light beams were abnormally sharp, as though they could slice through everything. However, when it struck Truth Listener’s resplendent golden body, it shattered like glass. Truth Listener instantly broke through the layers of starlight and threw a punch at Starlady Polestar, who was standing in the middle of the hall.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar finally made a move. She pulled out the embedded black ice sword from the ground with one hand. The black ice-like sword was instantly filled with starlight. The blade slashed out and collided with Truth Listener’s fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Golden and blue light erupted as the shockwave produced countless crystals inside the Chaos Egg, almost causing it to explode.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen no longer had the mood to pay attention to Truth Listener’s battle with Starlady Polestar. Now, his priority was to survive. Otherwise, the game would be over once he died. It was useless no matter how strong Truth Listener was.</p>
<p>It was clearly impossible for him to continue surviving by relying on the Chaos Egg’s powers. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how he could live a little longer.</p>
<p>Although the Teacher Domain could play a certain role, defense wasn’t the Teacher Domain’s forte, so it wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>Apart from the Teacher Domain and the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen also had two other domain powers. One was the Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens domain. This was clearly unsuitable for the present situation.</p>
<p>The other was the Beginningless Sword Domain. However, under normal circumstances, the Beginningless Sword Domain was used for attacks. Furthermore, the Beginningless Sword Domain was only at the Human Realm, making it difficult for it to withstand the power of the Heaven-level Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>However, with the help of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen acutely discovered an opportunity.</p>
<p>No matter how the Human Realm’s Beginningless Sword Domain changed, it was impossible for it to resist the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. However, Truth Listener attracted most of the starlight, giving the Beginningless Sword Domain a sliver of a chance.</p>
<p>This possibility was because Zhou Wen knew the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array very well. He had even used it as a blueprint to create the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. This made him think of something.</p>
<p>I can only take a gamble with my life. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and crazily activated the Qi Refinement Art. Countless Sword Pill particles erupted and surrounded the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill particles were also arranged in a cycle—the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array that Zhou Wen had created.</p>
<p>If used against ordinary Calamity creatures, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array formed by the Sword Pill particles could be said to be indestructible, but it was easily destroyed in Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.</p>
<p>However, the Sword Pill particles weren’t truly destroyed. They were a power that simultaneously had two incorporeal and corporeal states. What appeared like their destruction was, in fact, them transforming into incorporeal particles. In theory, the Sword Pill particles were truly immortal and indestructible.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sword Pill particles that had turned into incorporeal particles were temporarily useless. Zhou Wen had to persist until they turned back into corporeal particles.</p>
<p>If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to condense so many Sword Pill particles at once. However, the Chaos Egg was filled with Essence Energy Crystals. Furthermore, every Essence Energy Crystal was Essence Energy Crystals stacked with units of a hundred million. The amount of Essence Energy was astonishing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen directly attempted to use himself as a medium, or rather, a conduit. He used the Qi Refinement Art to crazily absorb the Essence Energy Crystals before transforming them into Sword Pill particles to form the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array to resist the terrifying external forces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was only at the Terror grade after all. If massive amounts of Essence Energy were sucked into his body, he probably wouldn’t be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had no choice. All he could do was place his hopes on the Qi Refinement Art.</p>
<p>The Qi Refinement Art was an extremely rich Essence Energy Art. From the moment he cultivated to now, Zhou Wen had devoured countless Essence Energy Crystals to cultivate it to such a level.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhou Wen would have felt his heart ache, but now, he only hoped that the Qi Refinement Art’s appetite was big enough to completely transform the Essence Energy Crystals he absorbed into Sword Pill particles.</p>
<p>A stack of Essence Energy Crystals that numbered in the hundreds of millions could explode Zhou Wen’s weak Terror body. Now that he had absorbed thousands of such Essence Energy Crystals, Zhou Wen could only silently pray for Sweetie’s blessing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wish to absorb that much, but if he didn’t, the constantly accumulating Essence Energy Crystals would fill the Chaos Egg up until it exploded.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Terrifying Essence Energy surged through Zhou Wen’s body, making him feel like his body was about to be crushed and explode. He couldn’t help but let out a roar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that his body was about to explode, but it didn’t happen. In the pain that resembled his body being completely crushed to powder, Zhou Wen managed to withstand it.</p>
<p>This didn’t mean that Zhou Wen’s body was strong, but that the Qi Refinement Art had forcefully allowed such violent Essence Energy to flow crazily in Zhou Wen’s body, transforming into a large number of Sword Pill particles.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body repeatedly jumped back and forth at the gates of hell. Every time Zhou Wen thought his body was about to explode, the Qi Refinement Art would transform and produce a large number of Sword Pill particles, allowing Zhou Wen, who had stepped into the gates of hell, to jump out again.</p>
<p>Although the Qi Refinement Art was doing a good job, there were too many Essence Energy Crystals. The speed at which they were converted couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen’s absorption speed.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought he was doomed, the Beginningless Sword Domain suddenly underwent a strange change.</p>
<p>Although this change was strange, it wasn’t a coincidence. Apart from a large number of Sword Pill particles being converted and forming the biggest Beginningless Sword Domain in history, Zhou Wen was constantly using the Teacher Domain to observe Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. At the same time, he adjusted the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array arranged by the Sword Pill particles.</p>
<p>The Hell-level Teacher Domain was much more powerful than before. The things it could analyze were naturally much more than before.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1685'>Chapter 1685 Sword Domain Level Up</h3>
<p>A large number of Sword Pill particles were arranged in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Sword Formation according to Zhou Wen’s will. As Zhou Wen constantly formulated it, the Sword Pill particles were arranged in an ever tighter-knit pattern.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen’s body was about to collapse, a large number of Sword Pill particles suddenly seemed to gain sentience and a life of their own as they automatically circulated.</p>
<p>All the Sword Pill particles seemed like iron powder that was being attracted by a magnet as they clumped together.</p>
<p>However, this clumping wasn’t without order. Instead, it was arranged according to the Minor Heavenly Cycle Array’s core. It also wasn’t completely arranged according to the rules. It seemed to be instinctively arranged according to some strange rules.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the Sword Pill particles connected tightly, leaving no gap between them. It was as though they had become a natural whole.</p>
<p>The Sword Pill particles were extremely small to begin with. Even if they were arranged under Zhou Wen’s control, it was inevitable that there would be gaps. However, there was no gap between the Sword Pill particles. It was as though they were one-a complete large Sword Pill particle.</p>
<p>However, the Sword Pill particles weren’t in the shape of a sword or pill. Instead, they were arranged in the shape of an egg that enveloped the Chaos Egg as it constantly blocked the attacks from the outside world.</p>
<p>/ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that his Sword Domain had advanced to the Hell level. Furthermore, it was crazily extracting Essence Energy from his body. The eggshell-shaped Sword Pill that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body grew bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Having advanced to the Hell level, the Sword Domain which couldn’t resist Starlady Polestar’s strength, became stronger and stronger due to the Qi Refinement Art’s absorption of Essence Energy and the infinite Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg.</p>
<p>As long as Essence Energy was available, the Sword Domain seemed to become infinitely stronger. The lack of quality was made up in quantity. Furthermore, the Sword Pill particles had the characteristics of immortality. They would only become stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Bullets could shoot through steel plates, but they couldn’t pass through a hundred-meter pile of soil. Now, because the Sword Pill particles in the Sword Domain were too dense and there were more and more of them, they gradually stabilized the situation while resisting Starlady Polestar’s strength.</p>
<p>The Hell-level Chaos Egg combined with the Hell-level Sword Domain produced an unexpected effect, allowing Zhou Wen to gain a foothold in such a terrifying battlefield.</p>
<p>As the Sword Domain leveled up, Zhou Wen had already sensed the changes in its effects. It didn’t mean that the Sword Domain would really be an egg-shaped object in the future.</p>
<p>The egg shape was only because Zhou Wen needed it to be arranged in this form. Based on Zhou Wen’s requirements, he could transform it into a sword or other shapes.</p>
<p>What the Sword Domain truly improved was the effect of Sword Pill particles becoming one.</p>
<p>A chopstick could easily be snapped, but a bundle of chopsticks could hardly be snapped. Furthermore, the Sword Pill particles that had combined into one were not as simple as a bundle of chopsticks. They were truly one.</p>
<p>Only now did Zhou Wen have the mood to size up the situation on the battlefield. However, all he could see was starlight and a constantly shimmering golden light.</p>
<p>It was so fast that even with Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he couldn’t see their actions clearly. He couldn’t even see their figures clearly. Wherever Truth Listener moved, there were golden afterimages. In Zhou Wen’s eyes, these afterimages were a golden ribbon of light of unknown length. The ribbons of light intertwined densely in the Star Palace like tangled hemp.</p>
<p>In fact, it was only a delay in Zhou Wen’s vision. The golden ribbon of light he saw was already an afterimage left behind by Truth Listener before it moved countless spots over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t see it, but the Teacher Domain could sense the changes in the nomological powers. In the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen felt an extremely domineering force constantly collide with a force that resembled a brilliant monarch’s aura. Without a doubt, the destructive force came from Truth Listener, while the brilliant monarch aura came from Starlady Polestar. The two forces were completely different, but they were equally terrifying.</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Wen couldn’t see it clearly, the Teacher Domain continued to replicate and deduce the rules of the brilliant monarch aura, making the power appear more and more orderly in Zhou Wen’s eyes.</p>
<p>From the situation, Zhou Wen roughly knew that the Teacher Domain was about to deduce a new Essence Energy Art.</p>
<p>They were both perfect domain powers, but the Teacher Domain only inferred Starlady Polestar’s powers and not Truth Listener’s powers. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Is it because Truth Listener’s powers are difficult to deduce, or is it because I already have the foundation of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Array? Zhou Wen guessed, but he couldn’t make an accurate judgment.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was an excellent thing for Zhou Wen. This was because as long as the Teacher Domain deduced Starlady Polestar’s Essence Energy Art, it could directly ban this power from circulating in the Teacher Domain.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was already looking forward to seeing how delightful it would be when the Teacher Domain stopped the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array from circulating.</p>
<p>Thinking of how he could go to Forbidden City to find the other Starlady Polestar and stop her Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array in front of her, Zhou Wen wished he could immediately head to Forbidden City.</p>
<p>It was clearly not an easy task to deduce Starlady Polestar’s Essence Energy Art. It was like a spiderweb as the Teacher Domain constantly perfected the nomological webs, hoping to connect them into a complete network.</p>
<p>However, there were too many missing parts. The speed at which the Teacher Domain weaved the net was too slow. At this speed, it would probably take at least eight to ten years to complete all the parts.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Wen suddenly felt the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array that had gradually become clearer become blurry again. What was even more terrifying was that in the blurry starlight, twelve mysterious celestial palaces seemed to appear. Each celestial palace seemed to contain a mysterious force that seemed otherworldly. Furthermore, each celestial palace had a different style.</p>
<p>It was like divine might that resembled an ocean, danger that resembled an abyss, unfathomable mystery, or immense imperial favor. The power of every celestial palace was shocking. Just seeing the phantom of the celestial palace nearly made Zhou Wen’s will collapse. He felt as tiny as an ant under the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p>The twelve celestial palaces were like divine temples that controlled everything in the universe. Any one of them could dictate the fate of all things. Life and death were just one thought away.</p>
<p>At that moment, the twelve celestial palaces exerted pressure at the same time. Beneath the celestial palaces was the handsome and wild Truth Listener, who was shimmering with golden light and had blonde hair dancing in the wind.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen felt the terrifying power in the twelve celestial palaces. Even if the remnant might swept over, the Hell-level Sword Domain around him shattered like scrap metal. It couldn’t withstand a single blow.</p>
<p>No matter how Zhou Wen extracted Essence Energy to replenish it, he couldn’t restore the Sword Domain.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought that he needed to run through the dungeon again, Truth Listener suddenly leaped up and charged towards the celestial palaces under the infinite pressure.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1686'>Chapter 1686 Emperor Star</h3>
<p>Starlady Polestar seemed to be an imperial monarch that had existed since ancient times. She looked down at all living beings from the top of the twelve celestial palaces as though everything in the world was just a toy beneath her hands.</p>
<p>“The heavens fall when an emperor is born. All fate lies in the twelve palaces. No life in the world can defy them.” Looking at Truth Listener that defied the heavens, Starlady Polestar slashed with the black ice sword in her hand lightly. The twelve celestial palaces came crashing down as though the universe was suppressed beneath them.</p>
<p>The tiny Truth Listener was like a drop in the ocean beneath the twelve celestial palaces. It was almost negligible.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener’s eyes burned like a golden sun. It didn’t dodge at all, nor did it hesitate. Its golden body burned as it extended its arm to its limits and threw a punch at the celestial palaces that came crashing from the sky.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A mysterious celestial palace that represented fate was torn apart by Truth Listener’s fist as its wreckage fell in all directions.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was like an overlord that defied the heavens. It ran amok and faced the heavens with an unstoppable might as it continued charging into the sky.</p>
<p>Booms sounded incessantly as Zhou Wen saw mysterious, unfathomable palaces that seemed to have the ability to suppress fate being penetrated by Truth Listener, turning into wreckage that filled the sky. The scene was shocking, making him feel an inexplicable sense of fear. At the same time, a ball of flames seemed to burn in his heart as his blood seemed to boil.</p>
<p>If the heavens destroy me, I will defy the heavens. If the emperor slays me, I will kill the emperor. No one in the world can control my fate.</p>
<p>In Zhou Wen’s eyes, Truth Listener was like an ancient god of war who disrespected the world and didn’t worship the supernatural. It used its body to desecrate divine might as it shattered all the celestial palaces.</p>
<p>When every celestial palace was shattered, cracks appeared on the black ice sword in Starlady Polestar’s hand.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar could still maintain her composure when a few celestial palaces were shattered in the beginning. However, as she watched the celestial palaces shatter one after another while Truth Listener continued tearing through the air with an indomitable force, the look in Starlady Polestar’s eyes behind her mask gradually turned into shock.</p>
<p>When the last celestial palace was shattered by Truth Listener, Starlady Polestar’s body trembled as the black ice sword in her hand shattered, turning into fragments of ice that scattered in all directions./ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M.</p>
<p>Truth Listener arrived in front of Starlady Polestar that very moment. The fist burning with golden flames blasted at her unreasonably.</p>
<p>The twelve celestial palaces shattered as Starlady Polestar’s aura declined to its nadir. She held the damaged sword and slashed at Truth Listener’s fist with all her might. However, at the instant the fist collided with the sword, the damaged sword shattered. The fist that emitted golden light struck her chest.</p>
<p>The black ice-like armor scattered like butterflies, revealing Starlady Polestar’s beautiful body and face. Her face was as beautiful as a goddess’s, making it impossible for anyone to desecrate her.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener’s fist mercilessly struck the beautiful face, instantly blasting it apart. The beautiful head that was like a work of art exploded as blood bloomed like the petals of a chrysanthemum flower.</p>
<p>Starlady Polestar’s headless body fell from the sky after her head exploded from the punch, turning into specks of profound light that dissipated. Only a strange crystal fell to the ground, emitting a resplendent starlight like the eternal north star in the sky.</p>
<p>‘Killed Calamity creature, Starlady Polestar. Discovered Emperor Star Crystal.’</p>
<p>He really killed her! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he looked at Truth Listener that resembled an ancient god in the sky. Truth Listener’s strength shocked him.</p>
<p>As expected of a Heaven-level 999 Companion Beast. It’s so powerful and violent. Zhou Wen reached out to pick up the Emperor Star Crystal on the ground and looked at its stats in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Emperor Star Crystal: Emperor’s Life Star. Can obtain the help of the world.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the simple information and was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this Emperor Star Crystal was likely the treasure of this hidden dungeon, but it was difficult to understand what use it had.</p>
<p>From the literal meaning, it should be saying that an emperor was the world’s chosen one, so his Life Providence was extremely honorable. Even the world would help him.</p>
<p>But how was such a thing used?</p>
<p>Could it be that this thing can make the person who possesses it become the chosen one? From then on, everything will be smooth sailing. I can get whatever I want. Just killing a random monster will drop a divine artifact. Not only will I not die from jumping off a cliff, but I can bump into fortuitous encounters? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the legend of an ancient emperor.</p>
<p>Legend had it that there was a chosen one who fought for the throne with a figure comparable to a transmigrator. This chosen one was originally forced to retreat in defeat and was about to be destroyed. However, to his surprise, a meteor descended from the sky and destroyed the enemy’s army, making him the final victor. The only explanation was that he was the chosen one.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare hope for such luck. He only hoped that he wouldn’t be too unlucky.</p>
<p>He attempted to absorb the Emperor Crystal, but he received feedback that he wasn’t a Companion Beast and couldn’t use it.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is this thing for Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen was rendered speechless as his dream of getting whatever he wanted instantly shattered.</p>
<p>If only Companion Beasts can use it, who should I use it on? Demonic Neonate is still evolving. I can only choose another Companion Beast to use this thing. Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed. There was too little information on the Emperor Crystal, so he didn’t know what use it had. If he randomly gave it to a Companion Beast, the benefits it obtained might not be as strong as he had expected. It might even have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>If this thing was a treasure that changed Life Providences and changed the Life Providence that was most compatible with Companion Beasts, what was the use of having it gain an Emperor Life Providence?</p>
<p>In terms of combat strength, Truth Listener was Zhou Wen’s greatest combat strength. He naturally should give it good things, but as he didn’t know what effects the Emperor Crystal had, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk with Truth Listener.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth. This fellow had previously advanced to the Calamity grade and had two Life Providences—Endless Strength and Mountain River Absorption. Even if he changed one to a useless Life Providence, his combat strength wouldn’t weaken much.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its name had the word “tyrant” in it. It could barely be related to an emperor. Zhou Wen planned on using it to test the waters.</p>
<p>After Tyrant Behemoth was summoned, it swallowed the Emperor Crystal under Zhou Wen’s orders.</p>
<p>When the crystal entered its stomach, a blob of black starlight immediately bloomed from Tyrant Behemoth’s stomach. Soon, it enveloped Tyrant Behemoth’s entire body in black light, as though it had transformed into a black hole.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only heard Tyrant Behemoth’s roar coming from the black hole. Soon, there was silence. Only the black hole-like light constantly distorted and changed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1687'>Chapter 1687 Imperial Lord Behemoth</h3>
<p>When the black hole-like light vanished, Tyrant Behemoth appeared in Zhou Wen’s vision again. Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that Tyrant Behemoth had changed so much.</p>
<p>The originally tall Tyrant Behemoth had become much smaller. It was only about three meters tall. Compared to before, it had clearly dropped in size, but it had become even more muscular.</p>
<p>In the past, Tyrant Behemoth looked a little bloated and clumsy, but now, Tyrant Behemoth looked like a muscular monster without any excess fat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tyrant Behemoth’s body had undergone some changes. Its flesh looked extremely black, as though it was made of black iron. It gave off an indestructible feeling</p>
<p>Now, instead of saying that Tyrant Behemoth was a living creature of flesh and blood, it was better to say that it was a black iron monster filled with explosive and destructive power.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that in the middle of Tyrant Behemoth’s head, another horn grew out. The horn looked somewhat similar to a unicorn’s horn. It was straight with spiral patterns, and there was a strange glow swirling inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened Tyrant Behemoth’s information to see what changes its stats and skills had undergone, but he realized that Tyrant Behemoth’s name had changed.</p>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth: Calamity (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Extreme Strength, Mountain River Absorption, Emperor’s Life</p>
<p>Life Soul: Violent Imperial Crown</p>
<p>Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength (S-grade)</p>
<p>Terror Form: Tyrant</p>
<p>Calamity Zone: Overlord Zone (Human Realm)</p>
<p>Strength: 199</p>
<p>Speed: 199</p>
<p>Constitution: 199</p>
<p>Essence Energy: 199 Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming, Rampage, Behemoth, Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Poison Fang, Bite, Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Boxing Glove</p>
<p>Seeing that Tyrant Behemoth’s domain was still at the Human Realm, Zhou Wen was slightly disappointed. However, there was an additional Emperor’s Life in his Life Providence. His Life Soul had also changed from Violent Crown to Violent Imperial Crown. His stats had reached the limits of the Human Realm, so it wasn’t completely unchanged./ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M.</p>
<p>Its stats and skills haven’t changed much. I wonder how its actual combat strength is. Zhou Wen muttered inwardly.</p>
<p>The level of the Big Dipper instance dungeon was high enough. Logically speaking, the treasures produced in the hidden dungeon shouldn’t be bad. Zhou Wen originally believed that it could at least advance to the Hell level, but he never expected it to remain at the Human Realm.</p>
<p>After quitting the Big Dipper instance dungeon, Zhou Wen originally planned on finding a dungeon to test the difference between Imperial Lord Behemoth and Tyrant Behemoth.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could launch a new dungeon, he heard a commotion in front of the team.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, I’m afraid we have to change our route,” Shiraishi Satomi rushed over and said to Zhou Wen with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“What happened over there?” As Zhou Wen asked, he used Truth Listener’s ability to scan the area ahead.</p>
<p>In front of them was a canyon with a river that was half a person’s height deep flowing through it. In the water, there was a behemoth lying horizontally. It looked like it had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi whispered helplessly, “The route we designed originally avoided some dangerous areas. According to our investigations, there weren’t any large dimensional zones near the canyon, but for some reason, a Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast appeared here. I’m afraid we can’t take this path.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t seem to know anything about the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, Shiraishi Satomi continued explaining, “The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast might not be famous inland, but overseas, it’s infamous. It once destroyed several large islands. Even the strongest factions overseas can’t do anything about it. It’s said that not only is this beast at the Calamity grade, but it might even have reached the peak of the Calamity grade. Furthermore, this Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast is very likely the one from overseas.”</p>
<p>“This is the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast from overseas.” Sei Gasakai also walked back and said with a heavy expression, “In the past, when I was out traveling, I saw its ferocious wrath on Ryukyu Island. With a stomp, it crushed an island spanning hundreds of kilometers into pieces and sent it sinking to the bottom of the sea. Its divine might was unparalleled. It’s even more terrifying than the Calamity-grade creatures that entered the Cube’s rankings. Thankfully, the scouts ahead discovered it ahead of time and didn’t wake it up. We still have time to change directions, but we have to walk a few hundred more mountain roads to circle it.”</p>
<p>“What’s the type of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast? What kind of abilities does it have?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“Its body is extremely powerful. Back when Ryukyu Island gathered the entire island’s powers to launch an attack, it didn’t dodge at all. It didn’t even damage its scales. Furthermore, it has the ability to control the water flows of the sea and can sweep up huge waves. I don’t know if it has other abilities,” Sei Gasakai answered after some thought.</p>
<p>“Then there’s no need to change course. Retreat fifteen kilometers and leave it to me.” It was rare to encounter a break-out Calamity creature, so Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t willing to miss such a good opportunity.</p>
<p>With Truth Listener, a Calamity-grade existence that was almost invincible, even if the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was really at the Heaven level, it was definitely no match for Truth Listener with its powerful body.</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhou, be careful.” Sei Gasakai didn’t say anything else as he arranged for the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to retreat in an orderly manner. However, after retreating for a few kilometers, the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast woke up and stood up from the water. It looked over with a pair of strange golden crystal-like eyes. The golden light in its eyes was like two miniature suns.</p>
<p>It was covered in red scales. Its head was like a dragon’s, and its body was like a lion’s. Its body was more than ten meters long. Just standing there gave off a terrifying pressure. When its strange eyes swept across, the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, who had weaker mental fortitude, were so frightened that their legs went limp. From the looks of it, this beast has long discovered our arrival. It just pretended to sleep. Zhou Wen knew that such Calamity-grade creatures had sharp senses, so how could it not have discovered them?</p>
<p>Although the aura of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was terrifying, Zhou Wen was accustomed to seeing powerful Calamity-grade creatures. He could roughly guess that this fellow hadn’t reached the level of Starlady Polestar, but it was much stronger than the typical Human Realm creature. It might be a Hell-level Calamity creature.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was about to charge at him, Zhou Wen thought of something and summoned Imperial Lord Behemoth. He could use this Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast to test Imperial Lord Behemoth’s combat strength.</p>
<p>Being the same Strength-type, Imperial Lord Behemoth had thick skin and flesh. Even if it wasn’t a match for the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, it wouldn’t be instantly killed. Once it wasn’t a match for the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, he could just release Truth Listener.</p>
<p>After Imperial Lord Behemoth appeared, the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, which had originally wanted to rush over, stopped. It rolled its strange golden eyes and sized up Imperial Lord Behemoth as though it didn’t find it an easy target.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt relieved when he saw this. He ordered Imperial Lord Behemoth to attack the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast.</p>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth exerted strength with its feet, instantly causing the ground beneath it to collapse hundreds of meters out. It charged at the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast as it tore forward with shockwave.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1688'>Chapter 1688: Ferocious Behemoth</h3>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth appeared in front of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast as though it had teleported. Its black iron-like claws struck its head.</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast roared and didn’t dodge. It opened its mouth filled with strange teeth and bit at Imperial Lord Behemoth.</p>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth was only about three meters tall. It was slightly taller than ordinary humans, but it appeared a little small in front of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast that was about ten meters long.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If this bite landed, most of Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body would probably be inside its mouth. It might even be devoured whole.</p>
<p>Everything happened in a split second. The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace couldn’t see what happened. Even an existence like Sei Gasakai could only see the two beams of light collide before a shockwave that resembled a nuclear explosion surged over.</p>
<p>Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, and company couldn’t help but be alarmed. Although they were still five to ten kilometers away from the battlefield, the range of the shockwave was too great. They weren’t afraid, but most of the ordinary disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace would probably be killed by the shockwave.</p>
<p>Seeing the shockwave that brought with it mud and sand sweeping over, the ordinary disciples were so shocked that they forgot to escape. In fact, even if they tried their best to escape, it was impossible for them to escape the range of the shockwave.</p>
<p>Just as countless disciples were in despair, they saw the huge shockwave suddenly vanish without a trace. The sand and rocks that filled the sky fell and formed a huge ring-shaped slope with the battlefield as the center.</p>
<p>Everyone looked over in horror and saw a figure standing in front of the ring-shaped slope. It was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The terrifying shockwave seemed to come to a halt when it reached him. It descended like dust as though Zhou Wen was a god that couldn’t be desecrated. Nothing in the world could violate him at all.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only used the Teacher Domain to ban the rules of force in the area, preventing the shockwave from continuing. This also indirectly meant that the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast hadn’t reached the Heaven level. Otherwise, the Teacher Domain wouldn’t have completely forbidden a perfect domain power.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, Imperial Lord Behemoth’s two claws grabbed the upper and lower jaws of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast and forcefully resisted its bite, preventing it from fully closing its fang-filled mouth.</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast exerted strength with its four claws as it charged forward with all its might. It pushed Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body back as its legs left a deep mark on the ground.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Just as everyone thought that Imperial Lord Behemoth was no match for the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, the three strange horns on Imperial Lord Behemoth’s head emitted a mysterious glow, transforming into a black crown. The horn in the middle emitted a mysterious glow like a black pearl embedded in the crown which enveloped Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body like black-iron imperial armor.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the crown, Imperial Lord Behemoth’s eyes turned blood-red as its body expanded. It instantly became a massive beast that was dozens of meters tall. Its two feet blocked the impact of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast one after another.</p>
<p>The two monsters were in a stalemate. They clashed like prehistoric monsters. Neither of them retreated half a step, but the ground beneath their claws fractured as though an earthquake was running through.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Imperial Lord Behemoth in surprise. This fellow’s strength was stronger than Zhou Wen imagined. The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was undoubtedly at the Hell level. Only Imperial Lord Behemoth could actually withstand the power of the Hell-level creature at the Human Realm without being at a disadvantage. Just this alone made Zhou Wen feel that his usage of the Emperor Star was indeed worth it.</p>
<p>What surprised Zhou Wen even more was that Imperial Lord Behemoth gradually gained the upper hand. It slowly split open the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast’s mouth that was about to close.</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast let out a strange whimper as it stomped the ground with its four claws, hoping to slam Imperial Lord aside. However, no matter what crazy actions it took, Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body, which was emitting a mystic glow, didn’t budge at all. It still slowly split opened the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast’s mouth.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast roared again as a strange energy fluctuation emitted from its body. The river in the valley seemed to be attracted by some force as it swept up huge waves.</p>
<p>The towering wave instantly drowned Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body as it swept towards disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace behind without stopping. However, when the wave reached Zhou Wen, it was like a toilet being flushed. All the water flowed down without touching Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace were dumbfounded. Although they had long treated Zhou Wen as a top-notch human, such godlike actions still left them alarmed and envious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expand the range of the Teacher Domain’s power to the battlefield. He wanted to see how powerful Imperial Lord Behemoth’s true combat strength was.</p>
<p>In the battlefield where water surged and mud tumbled, the roars of mutated beasts resounded through the world.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace only saw mud and rocks tumbling. They couldn’t see the battle inside at all until a shocking scream sounded.</p>
<p>The water and mud that were swept up instantly fell, revealing the figures of two behemoths.</p>
<p>The originally extremely terrifying Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was lifted up by Imperial Lord Behemoth. Imperial Lord Behemoth’s two claws still held onto its upper and lower jaw, but at that moment, the mouth of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast had already been widened to the extreme. The corners of its mouth had cracked open as the scales on its face cracked and blood gushed out.</p>
<p>Now, the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was like a kitten or puppy with its mouth torn open in front of the huge Imperial Lord Behemoth. It could only struggle and scream.</p>
<p>However, no matter how its claws attacked Imperial Lord Behemoth, they only left claw marks that weren’t too deep on the mystic light armor around Imperial Lord Behemoth’s body. As for the claw marks, they instantly healed.</p>
<p>Imperial Lord Behemoth didn’t seem to feel anything. It ignored the final struggle of the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast and slowly tore its mouth apart, hoping to rip its head into two.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast’s bloody chin was torn open. In pain, the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast unleashed its potential. It struggled backward with all its might, snapping the fangs that Imperial Lord Behemoth was holding. Only then did it escape its control and tumble to the ground.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace looked at Imperial Lord Behemoth, who had a broken tooth in one hand and a bloody chin in the other. It was as though they were looking at a devil king who had walked out of hell.</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, which was virtually invincible overseas, had been ravaged by Imperial Lord Behemoth like a kitten or puppy. Even its chin had been ripped off. It was just terrifying.</p>
<p>The typical disciple was envious, but the Elders were secretly rejoicing. They were glad that Honn Shinsakura hadn’t listened to them and insisted on heading to Guide Ancient City. Now, they understood his insistence.</p>
<p>Such a figure and such a Companion Beast were probably rare even among the six families.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen imagined that the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast was about to escape. Just as he was about to cooperate with Imperial Lord Behemoth to kill it, he suddenly saw an unbelievable scene.</p>
<p>The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast didn’t escape. Instead, it bent its front hooves and bowed its head at Imperial Lord Behemoth as though it was kneeling until its forehead touched the ground.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1689'>Chapter 1689: Wasting a Treasure</h3>
<p>Everyone saw this unbelievable scene. Even Zhou Wen gaped in surprise.</p>
<p>Dimensional creatures were very difficult to tame. Ignoring the brainless dimensional creatures that basically fought to the death, even highly-intelligent dimensional creatures would self-destruct when forced into a corner. Apart from humans with special abilities, it was very rare to hear of dimensional creatures being tamed after being bested in combat.</p>
<p>The higher the level of a dimensional creature, the lower the possibility of it being tamed. It was unbelievable that this Hell-level Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast would submit to the Human Realm Imperial Lord Behemoth.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right in front of him. Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility. Could it be that the Life Providence of the Emperor Life Providence had played a role, causing the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast to show an originally impossible attitude?</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. In the past, Tyrant Behemoth had killed many dimensional creatures, but he hadn’t seen any dimensional creatures submit to it.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Calamity grade, he had never encountered such a situation even with Mortal dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was filled with regret. If he had known that the Emperor Star was such a powerful item, he would have given it to Truth Listener. With Truth Listener’s strength, it was almost invincible among Calamity-grade creatures. He could just defeat a few Calamity-grade dimensional creatures and get them to submit to him before having them watch the gates at Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>It was useless to regret it now. Thankfully, Imperial Lord Behemoth was rather powerful. In the future, if he placed more effort on it and gave it more resources, even if it couldn’t advance to the Heaven level, it would be rather impressive at the Hell level.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If the Human Realm Imperial Lord Behemoth could defeat the Hell-level Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, then it was possible that the Hell-level Imperial Lord Behemoth might be able to compete with ordinary Heaven-level dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a pointless trip. If I get the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast to watch the gates at Guide Ancient City, I doubt even the six families would dare barge in. Just as Zhou Wen was daydreaming, Imperial Lord Behemoth grabbed the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast and ripped its body into two with its claws. Then, it threw it into its mouth and chewed, causing blood to splatter everywhere.</p>
<p>It actually ate… It ate… It ate… Zhou Wen widened his eyes and stared blankly at Imperial Lord Behemoth. He had the urge to slap the prodigal who had squandered all the wealth.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>This was a Hell-level fighter, but it was eaten just like that. It was a waste of a treasure. Such acts were deserving of a lightning strike.</p>
<p>However, Imperial Lord Behemoth didn’t think anything about it. After chewing a few times, it swallowed it and even burped.</p>
<p>/ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M.</p>
<p>Looking at the Imperial Lord Behemoth, Zhou Wen had the urge to slice open its stomach and pull out the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast. Unfortunately, it was useless even if he dug it out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth in hatred, but the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace were mesmerized. The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast that was extremely ferocious overseas had been devoured just like that. In their eyes, Imperial Lord Behemoth had become synonymous with ferocity and invincibility.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gloomily unsummoned Imperial Lord Behemoth. This fellow had eaten a Hell-level dimensional creature, but experienced no change. From Zhou Wen’s point of view, it was no different from Pigsy eating a Ginseng Fruit.</p>
<p>After setting off again, the disciples and elders of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace became even more respectful and obedient towards Zhou Wen. Many people even looked at Zhou Wen with fervent gazes. It was unknown what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what they were thinking. His mind was filled with a question. If the hidden dungeons in-game didn’t respawn, could he obtain the Emperor Star in real life?</p>
<p>From the results of his previous research, it was very likely that there was another Starlady Polestar in the North Pole Star Ice Palace in reality. Perhaps he could obtain another Emperor Star in reality.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally had no desire to challenge the Big Dipper instance dungeon in reality. The Cube’s ranking was meaningless to him.</p>
<p>However, this discovery made Zhou Wen have the thought of challenging the Big Dipper Palaces again. It wasn’t for the ranking, but to obtain an Emperor Star.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I’ll wait and see. If the hidden dungeon in-game really doesn’t respawn, I can only attempt the Big Dipper Palaces in real life. Zhou Wen had already made up his mind. If he could really obtain another Emperor Star, he would give it to Demonic Neonate or Truth Listener. He yearned for a few more.</p>
<p>Nothing unexpected happened along the way. The ordinary dimensional creatures they encountered were shooed away by Honn Shinsakura and company. Zhou Wen finally led them back to Guide Ancient City.</p>
<p>The two Niten Flying Immortal Palace disciples who had taken Mohe back arrived at Guide Ancient City half a day later. After Zhou Wen asked, he learned that they hadn’t sent Mohe all the way back to the Family Clan of Gods. They had met people from the Family Clan of Gods on the way and Mohe had returned with them.</p>
<p>To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Mohe got them to bring something back and said that it was for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the box and realized that there was only a piece of paper inside. On the paper was a number. It was obvious that it was a phone number.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen roughly guessed what Mohe was up to. The two of them had previously made a bet. If Mohe lost, he had to tell Zhou Wen why the Family Clan of Gods wanted the people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t ask because he felt that it was useless to ask. If Mohe wasn’t willing to say, he could just give a random reason. It wouldn’t be difficult.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Mohe planned on fulfilling his promise and telling him the secret.</p>
<p>After introducing Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, and company to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen got Li Xuan to settle them in. He returned to the yard and called the number left behind by Mohe.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Mohe’s voice sounded.</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s me?” Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. Mohe’s tone made it clear that it was him, but Zhou Wen hadn’t made a sound. Could it be that Mohe had the ability to spy on him through the signal?</p>
<p>“Only you know this number,” Mohe said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“I see. You left me this number to tell me the secret of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, right?” Zhou Wen was enlightened as he asked directly.</p>
<p>“Although I’m not a good person, I’m a person who will fulfill promises.” After a pause, Mohe continued, “Actually, the Family Clan of Gods doesn’t want all the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.”</p>
<p>“Who do you want? Sei Gasakai or Honn Shinsakura?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Neither. It’s Shiraishi Satomi,” Mohe answered.</p>
<p>“Why?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Although Shiraishi Satomi’s talent was pretty good, Honn Shinsakura and Sei Gasakai weren’t inferior to her. Furthermore, their cultivation levels were already above hers.</p>
<p>“Only she can obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast.” Mohe’s answer left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi came from the same pantheon. Furthermore, it was said that Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were twins.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1690'>Chapter 1690: Ise Island</h3>
<p>In that pantheon, Tsukuyomi represented the moon, and Amaterasu represented the sun. They were both supreme gods, and Amaterasu was ranked ahead of Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen Tsukuyomi’s prowess. If there was really a Amaterasu Companion Beast, even Zhou Wen was tempted.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still doubted if there really was an Amaterasu Companion Beast. After all, it was an existence similar to Tsukuyomi.</p>
<p>Since Tsukuyomi was already so powerful, Amaterasu was probably not inferior to Tsukuyomi. With humanity’s current standards, it was temporarily impossible for them to kill Amaterasu to obtain a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Now that Mohe had told him that Shiraishi Satomi could obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast, Zhou Wen didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“What’s so special about Shiraishi Satomi?” Zhou Wen asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Shiraishi Satomi’s Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny are all perfectly compatible with Amaterasu. Only she can obtain its favor,” answered Mohe.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen heard Mohe’s tone as though Shiraishi Satomi didn’t need to kill Amaterasu to obtain a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“This isn’t within the confines of our bet. Think about it yourself,” Mohe said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Can you give me a hint?” Zhou Wen didn’t mind and asked casually.</p>
<p>“Ise Island, we’re even.” With that said, Mohe hung up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen put down the phone and thought for a moment before finding Sei Gasakai. Since Honn Shinsakura and Shiraishi Satomi were also there, he recounted what Mohe had told him.</p>
<p>“Ise Island?” The three of them were at a loss after hearing that.</p>
<p>“You don’t know where Ise Island is?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>They were born and raised overseas. If they didn’t know where Ise Island was, Zhou Wen suspected that Mohe was joking with him.</p>
<p>“There’s no island overseas called Ise Island. In myths and legends, the Ise Divine Palace is the residence of Great God Amaterasu. The place is called Takamagahara, but that’s only a legendary place. There’s no corresponding location in reality.” Honn Shinsakura thought for a moment and said, “Could it be that the information given by Mohe is wrong?”</p>
<p>Shiraishi Satomi also said with a bitter smile, “Perhaps they are really mistaken. My Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny have nothing to do with the sun. How can they be perfectly compatible with the stats of Great God Amaterasu?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. Although he was a little interested in Amaterasu, this interest was built on Tsukuyomi’s existence. He wasn’t disappointed if he couldn’t obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to return to continue gaming, he heard Sei Gasakai say, “Takamagahara is indeed something that exists in legends. There’s no corresponding place in reality. However, when I was traveling at sea, I did encounter a place suspected to be Takamagahara.”</p>
<p>Seeing Zhou Wen look at him, Sei Gasakai continued, “Takamagahara, Ashihara no Nakatsukuni, and Yomi are the three domains that form the Bansei pantheon. Among them, Takamagahara is also known as Country in the Clouds or Sky Island. Legend has it that it’s an island floating in the clouds above the sea. It’s invisible to mortals, and it’s where the deities live.”</p>
<p>“Once, after I experienced a storm at sea, the sky opened up and the clouds dissipated. I vaguely saw a huge island appear in the sky, but a moment later, the island in the sky vanished. I also went to the sky to investigate, but I didn’t find any traces of the island, so I thought it was a mirage.”</p>
<p>With that said, Sei Gasakai pondered for a moment before continuing, “But later, I heard from some friends that they saw the mirage-like sky island in the same location. Furthermore, when the island appeared, someone attempted to approach it, but they were pushed out by a powerful invisible force. After the island vanished, there was nothing there. We suspected that it was likely the legendary Takamagahara, but we couldn’t confirm it.”</p>
<p>“Interesting. Where’s that island?” Zhou Wen was really interested. After all, it was a dimensional zone of a pantheon. Perhaps he could download the dungeon and grind to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen memorized the location Sei Gasakai told him. He could visit the place when he had the time in the future.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to do those things. All he wanted to know was if the hidden dungeon would respawn and if he could obtain a second Emperor Star.</p>
<p>There was another more important matter. Zhou Wen planned on letting Truth Listener see if it could kill the three-faced Buddha of Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>The hope of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra advancing to the Calamity grade was probably in Small Buddha Temple. However, the three-faced Buddha was just too powerful. With Zhou Wen’s own strength, there was temporarily no hope. Truth Listener’s advancement to the Heaven level gave Zhou Wen a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>After returning home, Zhou Wen opened the Small Buddha Temple dungeon and entered it again. He couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p>
<p>Truth Listener was obtained from Small Buddha Temple. Zhou Wen had no idea if it could defeat the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen directly circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and entered the temple hall. The three-faced Buddha didn’t react and wouldn’t attack anyone who cultivated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen was just here as a bystander. Truth Listener was the one who really needed to do all the work.</p>
<p>My Listener, you have to work hard. Whether the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra can condense a domain depends on you. Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and got it to remove the restrictions of the earrings as he prayed silently.</p>
<p>Just as Truth Listener was summoned, the three-faced Buddha, who looked like a lifeless statue, suddenly widened his eyes and looked at Truth Listener standing in front of Zhou Wen, giving him a fright.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that only by switching out the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra would the three-faced Buddha react. This sudden development gave Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>The three different faces of the three-faced Buddha—one without joy or worry, one filled with extreme sorrow, and one with a smile—had six Buddha eyes that emitted golden light. They stared at Truth Listener in unison.</p>
<p>The six golden beams were like six extremely bright searchlights that focused on Truth Listener.</p>
<p>The earrings on Truth Listener’s ears were unsealing, but only three of them had shattered. Under the Buddha’s eye’s golden light, the remaining three earrings shattered together, instantly allowing Truth Listener to remove all the restrictions. Its body quickly transformed into an ape before it took human form.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly urged Truth Listener to take action quickly, but Truth Listener stood there motionless. Zhou Wen saw the ruthless expression on its face as though it wanted to shatter the three-faced Buddha with one strike, but its body didn’t react at all.</p>
<p>It’s over. Truth Listener is completely restrained by the three-faced Buddha. I should have known that Truth Listener came from here. The possibility of defeating the three-faced Buddha is slim. Zhou Wen was alarmed as he knew that it was impossible to count on Truth Listener to kill the three-faced Buddha.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to unsummon Truth Listener, he suddenly saw the three-faced Buddha open its mouth to speak.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1691'>Chapter 1691: Great Samsara Wheel</h3>
<p>“Child of Buddha who walks the world, your tamed Companion Beast has already reached the Heaven level. You will be rewarded.” With the words appearing on the chat window on the phone, something flew out from the three-faced Buddha’s head and floated in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>It was an irregular crystal the size of a fist. The crystal emitted a strange dark golden light that looked a little like a Buddhistic glow, but it was also somewhat different.</p>
<p>Great Samsara Wheel! Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw the information on the crystal.</p>
<p>Great Samsara Wheel: A world-destroying item with destructive energy. Can be used to advance to the Apocalypse grade. There are a total of three. This is one of them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was truly alarmed. He had never seen what the Apocalypse grade looked like. It was unimaginable that this thing could advance a person to the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>Can this thing allow my Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to advance to the Apocalypse grade? Then wouldn’t I be invincible? Ignoring staying on Earth, even counterattacking the dimension isn’t a dream… Just as Zhou Wen was fantasizing, the three-faced Buddha spoke again.</p>
<p>“The other two Great Samsara Wheels will be obtained by the other two Sons of Buddha after their tamed Companion Beasts advance to the Heaven level. Only by gathering all three Great Samsara Wheels together and using their power can one advance to the Apocalypse grade.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, so this thing is a defective product! Zhou Wen was depressed.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t know who the other two people who had obtained Small Buddha Temple’s Companion Beasts were, he didn’t know how long it would take for their Companion Beasts to advance to the Heaven level. He had to pray that they didn’t die prematurely. Otherwise, there would be no hope for the three Great Samsara Wheels.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was still wondering how many chances he had of obtaining the three Great Samsara Wheels when he saw the three-faced Buddha continue speaking. “The three tamed Companion Beasts were originally one. Only by fusing them into one can they advance to the Apocalypse grade…”</p>
<p>As the voice gradually weakened, the golden light in the three-faced Buddha’s eyes gradually converged. Finally, they closed their eyes and returned to their lifeless statues.</p>
<p>What do you mean originally one? It’s basically to make the three Sons of Buddha and the tamed Companion Beasts fight and devour each other. In the end, only one can obtain all the benefits, Zhou Wen thought.</p>
<p>Looking at the motionless three-faced Buddha, Zhou Wen was considering a very important problem.</p>
<p>Although the three-faced Buddha didn’t say it clearly, he guessed that one had to be at the Heaven level to use the power of the three Great Samsara Wheels to advance to the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>The problem was that his Samsara Wheel was in-game, so it was impossible for him to take it out of the game. As for the other two Sons of Buddha, even if they could obtain the Great Samsara Wheel, it would be in reality. Even if Zhou Wen could snatch the other two Great Samsara Wheels back, it would be difficult for him to bring them into the game.</p>
<p>In other words, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to gather all three Great Samsara Wheels no matter what.</p>
<p>Is this considered a bug in-game? Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless as he looked at the Great Samsara Wheel in-game.</p>
<p>Although Small Buddha Temple basically couldn’t respawn and it wouldn’t be a problem to leave the Great Samsara Wheel here, it was useless to just leave it there. It needed all three wheels to be used.</p>
<p>I wonder if this thing can be used now? Zhou Wen attempted to use the Great Samsara Wheel in-game. He had only made a casual attempt believing that he was only at the Terror grade. Furthermore, this thing was incomplete. It was unlikely that he could really use it.</p>
<p>However, to his surprise, the Great Samsara Wheel immediately flashed with a dark-gold glow as it charged into the blood-colored avatar’s body. Then, the blood-colored avatar’s entire body was dyed dark-gold. It was like a dark-gold figure of light as the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra circulated crazily.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, that works too! Zhou Wen felt the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra circulate crazily as the Terror-form Great Brahma automatically appeared. Its entire body emitted a dark-gold glow like a world-destroying fiend.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the blood-colored avatar shared the same feeling. Now, Zhou Wen felt that the blood-colored avatar was enduring an indescribable sense of comfort.</p>
<p>That’s right, it was indeed comfortable.</p>
<p>If any other Essence Energy Art were to suddenly obtain such immense energy, they would definitely be in extreme pain even if they could barely absorb it. Their bodies would explode from the excessive energy, so how could they feel comfortable?</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was completely different. Zhou Wen felt comfortable as though he had eaten a ginseng fruit. His pores were filled with joy as he felt light as though he had fallen into the clouds.</p>
<p>Ever since he began cultivating, Zhou Wen had only had one thought for cultivation—hardship. However, today, it had changed Zhou Wen’s views drastically. He never knew that cultivating could be so comfortable.</p>
<p>Amidst this comfortable feeling, Zhou Wen even heard a decadent sound. An illusion of a beautiful Buddha girl circling him appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>Could it be that Small Buddha Temple cultivates in Happiness Meditation? Zhou Wen no longer felt as simple as being comfortable. He felt orgasmic.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s willpower was firm, so he wouldn’t succumb to it. However, the feeling was extremely pleasant. Furthermore, Zhou Wen could tell that this wasn’t some set of methods that questioned himself or a test of his willpower.</p>
<p>Great Brahma’s appearance was very similar to the three-faced Buddha, but he had four faces and eight arms. The front and left faces represented the pity and kindness of the world without any desire. Only the face on his back had never been seen. Even Zhou Wen himself didn’t know what the face looked like. All he could sense was that the eyes on the face were secretly peeping at all life.</p>
<p>As the power of the Great Samsara Wheel constantly surged in, the dark-gold light on Great Brahma’s body intensified as his head slowly spun.</p>
<p>The head spun instead of turning. The face on its back slowly spun to the front, and the face in front was slowly spun to the back.</p>
<p>The frontal face showed no joy or sorrow. It represented zero desires, so he didn’t have the ability to take the initiative to attack. This was also why Zhou Wen didn’t often use Great Brahma. It was just too passive.</p>
<p>When the face at the back gradually spun around, Zhou Wen could already see his side profile.</p>
<p>It was an extremely beautiful face. It was hard to tell if it was male or female, but it was extremely beautiful. Coupled with that faint smile, it gave off a charm that prevented him from moving his eyes away. He wished he could look at this face for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>However, on this face was a pair of sinister eyes. The eyes were also extremely beautiful, but if one looked at them for a long time, they would feel a chill in their hearts. The longer one looked at them, the more terrified they became.</p>
<p>If he kept staring at those eyes, he would probably go crazy from fear.</p>
<p>Such a face matched with such eyes was truly unfathomable.</p>
<p>When the face turned to the front, Zhou Wen’s comfort reached its peak. Then, he instantly fell from the clouds into the valley. The feeling of all the prosperity going to zero instantly occupied Zhou Wen’s heart.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>And at that moment, the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra’s domain condensed and advanced to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1692'>Chapter 1692: Rising to the Heaven Level!</h3>
<p>Small Perfection of Wisdom’s Calamity Zone was somewhat similar to the First Order of Chaos. They had both undergone changes over the Terror transformation. The face behind Great Brahma spun around, and his entire aura underwent a tremendous change. Even his strength changed with him, reaching the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>It was completely different from the expressionless frontal face. When this terrifying face appeared, Great Brahma no longer exuded the peace from before. Even his strength became incisive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could sense that this power carried an extremely destructive nature. However, before he could carefully savor it, Great Brahma underwent a new change.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. Great Brahma was actually charging straight for the Hell level. It wasn’t like other Essence Energy Arts that remained at the Human Realm after advancing to the Calamity grade.</p>
<p>A treasure that allows advancement to the Apocalypse grade is indeed different. Even if it’s only an incomplete portion, the energy it produces isn’t something ordinary Zone Cores can match. I wonder if Great Brahma has the chance of advancing to the Heaven level. Zhou Wen kept paying attention to Great Brahma’s changes.</p>
<p>The insights obtained from advancing could be said to be an extremely rare experience. It was probably impossible for it to happen a second time.</p>
<p>As the energy increased, the face behind Great Brahma vanished. The two faces on both sides gradually became blurry.</p>
<p>The eight arms vanished one after another.</p>
<p>When the other three faces completely vanished, leaving only that beautiful face, six of the eight arms vanished, making Great Brahma look even closer to a human.</p>
<p>As for his beautiful face, it seemed to have undergone some changes. It became even more unfathomable. He had a faint smile that didn’t seem like a smile; it looked like anger, sorrow, or worry, but none of them at the same time. It was impossible to tell what emotions he had.</p>
<p>/ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M. </p>
<p>Only the terrifying look in his eyes seemed to become even more terrifying.</p>
<p>At that moment, the game also indicated that the Calamity Zone had advanced to the Hell level, but Great Brahma continued changing without stopping.</p>
<p>It’s going straight for the Heaven level? Zhou Wen was delighted. The Heaven level was probably the best among humans. Even the human representatives who obtained the resources of the dimensional species probably couldn’t advance to the Heaven level in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Dark-gold matter appeared over Great Brahma’s body. The dark-gold matter was very likely the dark-gold crystals of the Great Samsara Wheel. The dark-gold crystals connected and transformed into something that resembled armor that enveloped Great Brahma’s body.</p>
<p>The armor gradually took form. Even Great Brahma’s face was enveloped by the dark-gold armor. The edge of the wheel of light that resembled a black hole behind him gradually turned into a dark-gold crystal, forming a wheel that resembled a black hole inside and a dark-gold crystal outside.</p>
<p>Great Brahma sat cross-legged as he formed a seal with his hand. The wheel behind him spun incessantly as though it was a god that had come from the void, making it even more unfathomable.</p>
<p>‘Great Brahma Zone advanced to the Heaven level.’</p>
<p>With the notification in-game, Great Brahma finally stopped changing. This was enough to surprise Zhou Wen. He was originally vexed about using the Great Samsara Wheel, but it had also cheered him up immensely.</p>
<p>It was hard to say if he could obtain the other two Great Samsara Wheels in the future, but advancing to the Heaven level was a huge boon.</p>
<p>As for not having this Samsara Wheel, the other two chosen ones had also had the possibility of advancing to the Apocalypse stage severed. However, what had that got to do with Zhou Wen? They could only blame their bad luck.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was interested to know who the two unlucky ones were. He wanted to know what expression they would have when they learned that one of the Great Samsara Wheels was gone.</p>
<p>Looking at Great Brahma, who had advanced to the Heaven level, Zhou Wen really wanted to use the three-faced Buddha to test its might.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen quickly dispelled this thought. He originally imagined that the three-faced Buddha might be at the Heaven level, but he found it unbelievable that he could produce a treasure like the Great Samsara Wheel that allowed advancement to the Apocalypse grade.</p>
<p>I should head out and try other dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen glanced at the statue-like three-faced Buddha and left the Small Buddha Temple dungeon.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was happily gaming at home to level up, the outside world wasn’t idle. The representatives of the various races constantly appeared in the world and made a name for themselves on the Cube.</p>
<p>Many of them were famous geniuses in the past, but there were also some unknown figures who appeared.</p>
<p>Mohe’s Cube’s ranking had already dropped to third place, and first place hadn’t changed for a long time.</p>
<p>The Sun race’s representative in the human world, “Karoman,” had established a record of clearing the six Star Palaces of the Big Dipper. Up to now, no one could match him.</p>
<p>There was already news that Karoman was a member of the Cape family, but they didn’t admit or deny it. Their attitude was very ambiguous.</p>
<p>A handsome man in golden armor who resembled a sun god stood outside the dimensional zone where the Family Clan of Gods was.</p>
<p>“Karoman, why aren’t you with the Cape family? Why are you here?” The guards of the Family Clan of Gods who were guarding the dimensional zone couldn’t help but become nervous when they saw the handsome man.</p>
<p>Karoman’s shocking performance in the Big Dipper palaces had already shocked the entire world. Some people even called him the strongest human powerhouse now.</p>
<p>“I want to see Mohe,” said Karoman calmly.</p>
<p>His voice was gentle, but it had an irresistible authority. When the guard heard this, he subconsciously turned around, hoping to find Mohe.</p>
<p>“Karoman, are you eager to determine the victor between us?” Mohe walked out of the dimensional zone and said to Karoman.</p>
<p>Mohe’s injuries had already healed. It was impossible to tell that he had been severely injured not long ago.</p>
<p>Karoman shook his head and said, “Although you are very strong, I’ve never treated you as an opponent. I’m here to get an answer from you.”</p>
<p>“What answer?” Mohe didn’t mind the arrogance in Karoman’s tone.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to ascend the Ise Shrine?” Karoman didn’t stand on ceremony as he asked directly.</p>
<p>“So what if I know? So what if I don’t?” Mohe asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll make a bet with you. If I win, tell me how to ascend the Ise Shrine.” Karoman still looked lofty.</p>
<p>“What do you have in mind?” Mohe knew that since Karoman had come knocking on his door, he definitely had an information source. Even if he denied it, he wouldn’t let it go so easily.</p>
<p>“The first person to clear the Big Dipper palaces is the victor,” said Karoman.</p>
<p>“Are you confident of passing the final Alkaid Star Palace?” Mohe frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Alkaid Star Palace was the Army Breaker Star Palace. The long steps in front of the Star Palace could eliminate all Essence Energy. No matter how strong a cultivator was, they would become trash without Essence Energy if they entered the Star Palace. Therefore, up to now, no one had been able to crack it.</p>
<p>“It can be cracked at any time,” said Karoman indifferently.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1693'>Chapter 1693: Karoman</h3>
<p>“Professor Gu, what do you think of the recent rankings?” Su Yi tried her best to host the program.</p>
<p>Although there had been a storm on the Cube’s rankings recently, with experts constantly appearing while the rankings constantly changed, the program’s ratings were very good. However, Su Yi just couldn’t lift her spirits.</p>
<p>Professor Gu answered, “At present, those who can enter the top ten of the Cube’s rankings are experts who can clear the fifth Star Palace. Only the Sun race’s representative, Karoman, who’s ranked first, has cleared the sixth Star Palace. He’s considered unique. However, according to my research, there should be three to four people in the top ten who have a high chance of clearing the sixth Star Palace.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” Su Yi asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll give an example first. For example, the representative of the Fallen race, Mohe. His strength shouldn’t be inferior to Karoman. It’s only a matter of time before he can clear the sixth Star Palace. The others also have similar strength. It’s just that even if they can clear the sixth Star Palace, they might not be able to surpass Karoman on the rankings, so they didn’t take action,” Professor Gu analyzed.</p>
<p>As the host, Su Yi’s reaction was still very fast. She continued in line with Professor Gu’s words and asked, “Then, Professor Gu, who do you think will be the first to clear the seventh Star Palace?”</p>
<p>“That’s hard to say. According to the results of Karoman’s previous attempt, the stone steps in front of Alkaid Star Palace can eliminate Essence Energy. He gave up before he finished walking the stone steps. From this, one can roughly determine that after reaching the end, one’s Essence Energy might be completely drained. With such characteristics, no matter how powerful a powerhouse is, they will be crippled when they reach the Star Palace. Unless one has a way to retain Essence Energy, no one has a chance of clearing the seventh Star Palace.”</p>
<p>Professor Gu paused for a moment before continuing, “As for who has such an ability, it’s still unknown for the time being. However, there’s one thing that’s certain. It’s difficult to avoid having one’s Essence Energy drained. Therefore, although he’s ranked higher, he has the least chance among them.”</p>
<p>The comments were discussing who would be the first to clear the seventh Star Palace. There were all kinds of comments, but the topic of discussion was basically on the top few.</p>
<p>Just as the discussion was getting heated, they suddenly saw the Cube’s screen light up. A figure appeared on the screen. It was none other than Karoman.</p>
<p>“Karoman?” Su Yi was stunned when she saw Karoman. Professor Gu’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>“Karoman is already ranked first. There’s no need for him to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces again unless he wants to challenge the seventh Star Palace…” Su Yi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu is mighty. As expected of his jinxed mouth.”</p>
<p>“Sect Master Gu will unite the world for ages.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“I’m willing to call the Sect Master Gu the strongest in the universe.”</p>
<p>The comments were all expressing their amazement of Sect Master Gu. Professor Gu had just said that it was impossible for him to clear the seventh Star Palace, and here he was challenging it. Furthermore, he was clearly here for the seventh Star Palace. Everyone felt that Professor Gu was truly amazing.</p>
<p>The golden-armored Karoman arrived in front of the first Star Palace. Sun God Light bloomed from his body as though he was a divine son blessed by the Sun God.</p>
<p>With every step he took, the golden Sun God Light on his body was dazzling, making his handsome face appear even more holy.</p>
<p>When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw Karoman walk in, he immediately blasted out a blast of light. Karoman also threw a punch. The sun-like golden divine light collided with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s blast of light.</p>
<p>The terrifying dazzling light made it impossible for anyone other than a very small number of experts to see what was happening on the screen. The experts knew that Karoman and Starlord Ravenous Wolf had exchanged countless punches at that instant. Their speed had already reached the speed of light, so ordinary people couldn’t see their actions.</p>
<p>As for the broadcast, it was completely dazzling. Soon, when the dazzling light vanished, Starlord Ravenous Wolf had already been killed by Karoman. Many crystals dropped on the ground.</p>
<p>“He’s so powerful. He killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf in one punch.” The average person only saw Karoman deliver a punch and thought that he had instantly killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf with one punch.</p>
<p>“No matter how many times I look at it, it’s always so pleasing to the eye. Karoman is just so perfect. He doesn’t look like a human at all. He’s like the Sun God Apollo.”</p>
<p>Everyone marveled at Karoman’s strength, feeling envious. Many people wondered when they would be lucky enough to be chosen by the dimensional races to become a powerful existence like Karoman.</p>
<p>Karoman cleared one Star Palace after another. The Starlords who looked extremely powerful in the eyes of ordinary people were easily killed by Karoman. It only took a few seconds.</p>
<p>However, ordinary people couldn’t see that Karoman had actually used many techniques. The reason he could kill the Starlords so quickly was mainly because he had already understood their abilities and used targeted tactics.</p>
<p>Even so, it was rather shocking.</p>
<p>“Although I’ve already seen it once, I have to admit that Karoman is extremely powerful. He does resemble Human Sovereign’s former glory,” Su Yi said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Su Yi’s exclamation triggered a collective criticism on the screen.</p>
<p>“Although you are my goddess, there’s no way to compare Human Sovereign and Karoman now, right? It’s impossible for pure humans to advance to the Calamity grade, right?”</p>
<p>“Sis, isn’t Human Sovereign old news from years ago? The new generation replaces and surpasses the old. Human Sovereign has long been smacked to death on the beach.”</p>
<p>“Although I’m unwilling to admit it, I have to say that the strength of the representatives who obtained the resources of the dimensional races has increased too quickly. Unless Human Sovereign has become a representative, there’s nothing to compare.”</p>
<p>“With Human Sovereign’s temperament, he probably won’t bow down to the dimensional races. It’s unlikely he will become a representative.”</p>
<p>“It would be sad if Human Sovereign becomes a representative.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to be sad about? What era are we in now? Everything depends on strength. It’s sad if you don’t have strength.”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s discussion, Karoman had already cleared the sixth Star Palace and arrived at the long staircase of the seventh Star Palace.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately fell silent as they held their breaths and watched the screen. The last time, Karoman had given up midway. Thankfully, there was still a chance of giving up before entering the Star Palace’s entrance. If he entered the Star Palace, he wouldn’t even have the chance to give up.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, Karoman stepped onto the flight of stairs and walked towards the Star Palace’s door.</p>
<p>Everyone counted the number of steps Karoman took in their hearts. When he reached the spot he had given up the last time, he didn’t give up as before. Instead, he continued walking.</p>
<p>When he reached the end of the stone steps, even Su Yi couldn’t help but raise her voice and shout, “Karoman has walked all the way up!”</p>
<h3 id='chapter1694'>Chapter 1694: Our Relationship as Fellow Disciples Can’t Just Fade Away</h3>
<p>Professor Gu felt a little embarrassed as Karoman walked up the stone steps. The sun-like golden divine light on his body was still as resplendent as before. Anyone could tell that he had found a way to be immune to the Essence Energy drainage.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, Karoman pushed open the door to Alkaid Star Palace. It was like an unknown new world that drew everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>Starlight shimmered in Alkaid Star Palace. Starlord Army Breaker stood there like a god.</p>
<p>Karoman didn’t show any fear. The golden divine light on his body rose like flames as he walked towards Starlord Army Breaker.</p>
<p>His footsteps were calm and he wasn’t as fast as he was in the other Star Palaces. After all, Starlord Army Breaker was an unknown Starlord. He had only obtained some information from the Sun God Holy Temple, and it was only speculation. It wasn’t completely accurate.</p>
<p>Starlord Army Breaker suddenly opened his eyes. His originally calm aura immediately turned into killing intent that surged into the sky. His body charged at Karoman like a phantom.</p>
<p>Karoman didn’t retreat and actually went forward.</p>
<p>Starlight shot out as the sun shone.</p>
<p>The screen was filled with light, making it impossible to see what had happened. Only a few Calamity-grade experts could tell what had happened by standing in front of a Cube.</p>
<p>The entire world was dead silent. Everyone looked at the screen that was trembling violently with light. Although they didn’t know what had happened, the sound of forces colliding inside made their hearts undergo upheavals.</p>
<p>“Can Karoman clear the seventh Star Palace?” Su Yi muttered.</p>
<p>“A battle at this level is too high-end. Ignoring the fact that I can’t see anything on the livestream, even a Calamity-grade powerhouse can only see some clues through the Cube. All we can do now is wait for the slow-motion replay before analyzing. However, when the outcome is decided, there won’t be much point analyzing,” Professor Gu said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, we believe in you. Karoman will definitely win.”</p>
<p>“Sect Master Gu, that’s not right. You can’t doubt your jinxing standards. You have to be confident in yourself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say another word. You are our beacon of light. We don’t even need to see the outcome to know that Karoman will definitely win.”</p>
<p>Many people in the comments were teasing Professor Gu, making him feel a little depressed. However, after such a long time, he had mostly gotten used to it. The title of Jinx Sect Master had long been known by the entire world.</p>
<p>Mohe stood in front of the Cube with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“Mohe, what’s the situation? What are the chances of Karoman winning?” an elder from the Family Clan of Gods asked.</p>
<p>Even the powerhouses of the Family Clan of Gods couldn’t tell much.</p>
<p>“Karoman has already figured out Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities. I’m afraid he’s about to clear the seventh Star Palace.” Mohe paused before saying, “This fellow is indeed terrifyingly strong. It’s not only because he obtained the resources of the Sun God Temple, but mainly because he has extremely high combat intelligence and talent.”</p>
<p>“He’s clearing it now? From the looks of it, this person poses the greatest threat to our Family Clan of Gods among the younger generation,” the elder said after some thought.</p>
<p>Mohe didn’t refute him, but another figure appeared in his mind. Although Karoman was indeed very powerful, he still found that person even more terrifying.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. When people could finally see the scene on the screen, only the son of the Sun God, Karoman, remained standing in the Star Palace.</p>
<p>“He cleared the seventh Star Palace in less than six minutes. He’s really strong.”</p>
<p>“Karoman is truly invincible.”</p>
<p>“He’s undoubtedly the strongest human at this stage.”</p>
<p>“F*ck, the Cape family sure is lucky. They clearly are backed by the Divine Emperor Holy Temple, but they actually produced a representative of the Sun God Temple. This is just ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s exclamations of praise, Karoman walked towards the teleportation nexus and was teleported out of the Big Dipper Palaces. The ranking on the Cube remained the same. Karoman remained in first place.</p>
<p>“As expected, the Alkaid Star Palace is the last Star Palace. Karoman is the first human to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. He will permanently enter the annals of history. Even if someone else clears the seventh Star Palace in the future, they won’t be able to waver his status. After all, being the first person to clear it is the most difficult,” Professor Gu sighed.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi was also very excited, she felt a little disappointed. She hoped that the person in her heart would be the first to clear the Big Dipper Palaces.</p>
<p>Are pure humans really going to be eliminated by the times? Su Yi sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to this matter at all. At that moment, he was immersed in Great Brahma’s terrifying abilities.</p>
<p>Great Brahma at the Heaven level was completely different from when it was at the Terror grade. If the Great Brahma in the Terror transformation was a god that took pity on the world, then the present Great Brahma was a god that was disappointed with the world and wanted to destroy the world to cleanse it.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>They were both gods, but the two were worlds apart.</p>
<p>Now, not only did Great Brahma possess destructive power, but he could also fuse with Zhou Wen’s body and let him use his strength.</p>
<p>In-game, after the blood-colored avatar fused with Great Brahma, it looked like he was wearing dark-gold armor. It gave off a mysterious and extremely powerful feeling.</p>
<p>In particular, the black hole-like wheel of light behind him made the dark-gold armor appear blurry and illusory as though it didn’t belong to the human world.</p>
<p>Just as he was admiring the powers of Great Brahma from the fusion, his phone suddenly rang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that it was from Hui Haifeng, who he hadn’t contacted in a long time.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, what have you been busy with recently? Why didn’t you contact me? Our relationship as fellow disciples can’t just fade away,” Hui Haifeng said with a grin. It was hard to tell that he was already the supreme leader of the Federation.</p>
<p>“Speak your mind.” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. Hui Haifeng had thrown Hui Wan at him and now he was doing this.</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on the matter regarding Karoman?” Hui Haifeng’s tone turned solemn.</p>
<p>“What Karoman?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Are you serious? Don’t you know that Karoman has cleared the Big Dipper Palaces?” Hui Haifeng asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Someone cleared the Big Dipper Palaces so quickly? I really didn’t know about this and didn’t pay much attention to it. Who’s Karoman?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“To think that you are the lord of a city and an overlord of an area now. You don’t even know such a huge matter. What kind of City Lord are you?” Hui Haifeng was somewhat speechless. After a pause, he said, “Karoman is from the Cape family. He’s now the representative of the Sun God Holy Temple. He has just cleared the Big Dipper Palaces. The entire world is filled with news about him.”</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with me?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course it has something to do with you. Look at the rankings. The top ten are all representatives of the dimensional races. If this continues, I’m afraid everyone will think that there’s nothing wrong with being ruled by the dimension. In the future, we…”</p>
<p>“Stop. What do you want? Get to the point.” Zhou Wen didn’t have the patience to listen to him reason.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, as the saying goes, with great strength comes great responsibility. In order to let the citizens of the Federation regain their glory as humans, shouldn’t you show your face on the rankings and let them know that even if you don’t submit to those fellows from the dimension, humans can still become top-notch powerhouses…” Hui Haifeng spoke with emotion and reason, a heartfelt speech.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1695'>Chapter 1695: Human Sovereign Appears Again</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen had plans on challenging the Big Dipper Palace in real life, so there was an immediate agreement. Therefore, Zhou Wen agreed without rejecting him.</p>
<p>The Big Dipper Palaces in-game had already respawned. Zhou Wen grinded it again, but just as he had expected, Starlady Polestar hadn’t respawned. He was basically certain that he could only grind the hidden dungeons once in-game. If he wanted to obtain the treasures in the hidden dungeons, he had to think of a solution in reality.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen had been a little hesitant previously, afraid that he would die before Truth Listener defeated Starlady Polestar, Great Brahma’s advancement to the Heaven Realm completely dispelled this worry.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was considering what identity to use to clear the Big Dipper Palace.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s status, he would definitely become the focus of all the factions in the future. The various races in the dimension would probably treat Guide Ancient City and him as a thorn in their side. They would think of all possible ways to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Therefore, after some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to challenge the Big Dipper Palace as Human Sovereign. Furthermore, this identity had high prestige among humans, so it was most suitable.</p>
<p>Sweetie, please bless me. Let me obtain another Emperor Star. Zhou Wen couldn’t get his mind off the Emperor Star. That thing could add a Life Providence for no reason. It was very suitable for any Companion Beast.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He headed straight for a Cube, Hui Haifeng hoped that he struck while the iron was hot. He wanted to crush the rankings before Karoman’s achievement caused a greater impact.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, Karoman has become the first person to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. Those in second place to tenth place haven’t even been able to clear the sixth Star Palace. I’m afraid the rewards of the Big Dipper Palaces this time will be very likely to belong to him.” Su Yi chatted with Professor Gu on the program.</p>
<p>Professor Gu nodded slightly and said, “Although everything is still unknown before the Cube’s countdown ends, it will be very difficult for anyone to surpass Karoman for the time being. Even if someone can clear the Big Dipper Palaces, it won’t be easy to surpass him on the rankings.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As Professor Gu spoke, he suddenly realized that the Cube’s screen had lit up again.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Another person wants to challenge the Big Dipper Palace? Who could it be? Mohe or someone else?” Everyone watching the program was slightly taken aback before they became excited.</p>
<p>“The reason this person’s challenging the Big Dipper Palaces at this time is clearly because of Karoman!”</p>
<p>“Someone’s trying to stir up some sh*t! However, to be able to cause a stir, they must be someone with extraordinary strength. At the very least, they have to have the strength to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. Who could it be?”</p>
<p>/ please keep reading on MYB0XN0VEL(d0t)C0M.</p>
<p>As everyone discussed, a white figure appeared on the Cube’s screen.</p>
<p>The pure white figure was like a god wrapped in holy light. Although they couldn’t see what the person in the light looked like, many people immediately recognized who it was.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t! Human Sovereign is here!”</p>
<p>“F*ck! Human Sovereign is here? What does he want? Does he want to storm the Big Dipper Palaces?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I didn’t give up. I’ve waited for you. Human Sovereign, you’re finally here!”</p>
<p>“Why are you so excited? For Human Sovereign to come here means that he’s definitely a Calamity-grade existence. Without becoming a representative and receiving the help from the dimension’s massive resources, do you think a pure human can advance to the Calamity grade so quickly?”</p>
<p>“Sigh, what you said makes sense. The present Human Sovereign is probably not the former Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed spiritedly as the comments flooded in, making it almost impossible to read them. It was obvious that Human Sovereign hadn’t been completely forgotten. He had just been silent for too long.</p>
<p>“Did Human Sovereign choose to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces at this time because he has an agenda? Professor Gu, what do you think?” When Su Yi saw Human Sovereign challenging the Big Dipper Palace, she looked completely different. She looked very spirited.</p>
<p>“You mean that Human Sovereign chose to storm the Big Dipper Palaces the moment Karoman cleared the seven Star Palaces to prove that ordinary humans aren’t inferior to the representatives?” Professor Gu said.</p>
<p>Su Yi nodded excitedly. “I think it’s not as simple as a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign must have come prepared if he chose to attempt the rankings at this moment. Furthermore, he has already seen the battle between Karoman and Starlord Army Breaker. He knows Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities. It shouldn’t be a big problem to clear the seventh Star Palace.” Professor Gu didn’t mention if Human Sovereign was pure human. He only said that Human Sovereign would definitely be able to clear the seven Star Palaces.</p>
<p>“It’s over. With Sect Master Gu’s jinxing, Human Sovereign is in danger.”</p>
<p>“No, Sect Master, you are going to jinx Human Sovereign!”</p>
<p>The comments were filled with wailing. Who could withstand Jinx Sect Master’s jinxing?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>An Sheng stood behind An Tianzuo and said as he looked at the scene on the Cube, “Overseer, if Young Master Wen were to rush to the top of the rankings at this moment, he would definitely be able to inspire many humans. This will be extremely beneficial to humanity’s future development.”</p>
<p>An Tianzuo said coldly, “Ignoring the question of whether he can clear the seven Star Palaces, even if he plans on doing so, according to the rules of the Cube’s ranking, the first person to clear the seven Star Palaces will receive an unspoken bonus score. It will be very difficult for him to be ranked above Karoman. If he’s calm enough and studies Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities, he might have a chance of defeating him in the most perfect manner. He’s already such a grown man, but he’s still so rash.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Young Master Wen already has a card up his sleeve,” An Sheng muttered.</p>
<p>“What do you mean a card up his sleeve? I think he’s just hot-headed.” An Tianzuo snorted as he stared at the screen, his eyes seemingly filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign has actually appeared at this moment. Things have become interesting.” Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan were also watching in front of the Cube in the Zhang family compound.</p>
<p>“Is Human Sovereign still pure human?” Xia Liuchuan stared at the figure on the screen with interest, but unfortunately, he couldn’t even see what the person inside looked like.</p>
<p>“We’ll know soon,” Zhang Chunqiu said indifferently.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The various factions were paying attention to Human Sovereign. Instead of saying that they wanted to know if Human Sovereign could clear the Big Dipper Palaces, they wanted to know if Human Sovereign had become a representative.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen appeared in his Terror form as Human Sovereign. In fact, he had already fused with Great Brahma, but he didn’t plan on using Great Brahma to fight.</p>
<p>Under everyone’s expectant gazes, Zhou Wen pushed open the Star Palace’s door and summoned Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback. They never expected Human Sovereign to summon a Companion Beast to fight. Although very few humans had Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, it was almost impossible to clear the level with just one Companion Beast in a continuous battle like the seven Star Palaces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, fighting on the Cube was watched by everyone. Using too many Companion Beasts was equivalent to showing their trump cards to their enemies. Therefore, unless necessary, very few people used Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Could it be that Human Sovereign’s strength hasn’t reached the level needed to clear the seven Star Palaces? He needs to rely on the power of multiple Companion Beasts to clear the seven Star Palaces. If that’s the case, it should be very difficult for him to surpass Karoman on the rankings, right? Many people had such thoughts flash through their minds.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1696'>Chapter 1696: Blasting Apart With A Slap</h3>
<p>“Humanoid Companion Beast? It looks so cool!”</p>
<p>The Truth Listener that Zhou Wen had summoned had its limiter removed with the six earrings. It appeared in the Star Palace in its human form. Its handsome and wild appearance immediately attracted the attention of many people.</p>
<p>Even in this era where Calamity creatures were common, humanoid Companion Beasts were still extremely rare.</p>
<p>Before anyone could carefully appreciate Truth Listener’s appearance, it instantly arrived in front of Starlord Ravenous Wolf.</p>
<p>Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s fist emitted light, but before he could deliver a blast of light, Truth Listener’s palm struck him to the ground along with his blast of light. It exploded as all sorts of Essence Energy Crystals dropped and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see the battle process, but everyone could see Truth Listener’s strike that blasted Starlord Ravenous Wolf apart. This was because its actions were so simple, direct, and without any technical content.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what the hell is this?”</p>
<p>“This Companion Beast is so cool! If he were a human, I would definitely marry him.”</p>
<p>“To slap Starlord Ravenous Wolf to death in one strike. This Companion Beast is comparable to Karoman. It’s no wonder Human Sovereign dares to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces.”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, this Starlord Ravenous Wolf is fake, right? He’s a Calamity-grade creature after all. He was killed just like that?”</p>
<p>The entire world instantly broke into an uproar. Su Yi said excitedly, “As expected of Human Sovereign. Just a mere Companion Beast of his is already so powerful. I wonder how powerful he is. I really look forward to seeing him personally take action.”</p>
<p>Professor Gu continued, “Your anticipation might not last long. This Companion Beast is indeed extremely powerful, but it’s obvious that he’s a Strength-type melee Companion Beast. It shouldn’t be difficult to deal with Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate, but when it comes to Starlord Cherished Kismet of the Third Star Palace, this Companion Beast will be restrained. It needs Human Sovereign to take action himself or summon a new Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s discussion, Zhou Wen had already arrived at the second Star Palace with Truth Listener. Just as Professor Gu had predicted, Truth Listener effortlessly killed Starlord Titan Gate. Everyone could clearly see that Starlord Titan Gate had no means of retaliating.</p>
<p>“Now, I want to know how Human Sovereign will deal with Starlord Cherished Kismet. Will he do it himself or summon a new Companion Beast?” Professor Gu said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Professor Gu’s explanation, everyone began to look forward to it. They were discussing if Human Sovereign should take action himself or summon a new Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Some people looked forward to seeing Human Sovereign’s glory, while others hoped to see him showcase more powerful Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>However, after Human Sovereign walked into the Cherished Kismet Palace, he didn’t summon another Companion Beast. Professor Gu said, “From the looks of it, Human Sovereign plans on taking action himself. I wonder what kind of power he will use and what strategy he will take. However, as long as Human Sovereign takes action, I can roughly tell if he advanced to the Calamity grade as a pure human…”</p>
<p>Before Professor Gu could finish his analysis, he saw Truth Listener blast apart Starlord Cherished Kismet with a slap.</p>
<p>Exploded from a slap… Exploded from a slap… Exploded from a slap… The scene became a little odd. The professor’s eyes widened and his mouth gaped open for a long time.</p>
<p>Does this even f*cking make sense? Isn’t Starlord Cherished Kismet able to reflect damage? Doesn’t it have powerful recovery abilities? Isn’t it able to restrain Strength-type Companion Beasts? Isn’t it invincible when being beaten? What happened? Where am I? Who am I? Professor Gu’s mind was filled with questions.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Haha, my Human Sovereign is awesome. There’s no such thing as strategy. There’s no need to do it himself. The Companion Beast can resolve it with a slap.”</p>
<p>“This Companion Beast is invincible. It can even slap the opponent to death. It freaking doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me Human Sovereign will use one Companion Beast to kill all seven Starlords?”</p>
<p>“Awesome, Human Sovereign is mighty. I never knew that Companion Beasts could be so ferocious.”</p>
<p>“This is the strongest Companion Beast in the world. I won’t accept any retorts.”</p>
<p>Many humans had great expectations and a good impression of Human Sovereign to begin with. Truth Listener’s domineering performance instantly ignited everyone’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast is so powerful. Which type of Companion Beast do you think it is? Will Human Sovereign use this Companion Beast to clear the Big Dipper Palaces? If that’s the case, will his ranking have a chance of overtaking Karoman?” Su Yi was very excited as she raised several questions.</p>
<p>Professor Gu finally snapped to his senses and forced himself to calm down. “From the looks of it, this Companion Beast’s level should be very high. It ignores powers that are strong against the Strength stat. If nothing goes wrong, he should be able to clear the Big Dipper Palaces with a Companion Beast.”</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, don’t do that. I’m afraid Human Sovereign won’t be able to withstand your jinx.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to be afraid of? If this Companion Beast doesn’t work, Human Sovereign will definitely have other powerful Companion Beasts. It will be a feast for our eyes to see a few more.”</p>
<p>Everyone was delighted. In the past, they couldn’t see the battles between the other experts and the Starlords clearly. They could only watch the slow-motion analysis afterward. This was the first time they had seen it so clearly on the livestream.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen led Truth Listener to clear one Star Palace after another, all of them exploding with a single slap. No Starlord could withstand the seemingly simple strike, nor did they have the chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>When the various factions saw how powerful Truth Listener was without the need to use any countermeasures or strategies to kill the Starlords, their expressions turned extremely odd.</p>
<p>They originally wanted to observe Human Sovereign’s strength through this battle, but now, they didn’t even know what abilities Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast had, much less Human Sovereign’s strength.</p>
<p>Such a slap was like striking an egg. Nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast should be the strongest in the world.” An Sheng sighed.</p>
<p>“Humph, to rely on external forces and not pay attention to his cultivation will result in him suffering sooner or later.” Although An Tianzuo said that, he couldn’t help but size up Truth Listener.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The first six Starlords failed to cause any trouble for Truth Listener. Now, people were wondering if the long staircase in front of Alkaid Star Palace that could drain Essence Energy could restrain Human Sovereign and his Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“The first six Star Palaces failed to put any pressure on Human Sovereign. Will the final Alkaid Star Palace give him some pressure?” Su Yi was confident in Human Sovereign. She firmly believed that Human Sovereign would definitely be able to clear the seventh Star Palace. She only wanted to know if the long staircase could cause any trouble for him.</p>
<p>“In theory, the long stairs can wipe out Essence Energy. Even if that Companion Beast’s strength is invincible, it’s still an Essence Energy creature after all. It will definitely be restrained on the long steps. If Human Sovereign doesn’t have a way to restrain the flight of stairs, I’m afraid this won’t be easy. However, since Human Sovereign came, he must be prepared. I believe he should have the ability to restrain the stairs. Then, all he needs to do is unsummon the Companion Beast and summon it after entering the Star Palace. That will resolve all the problems.” Professor Gu analyzed the strategy that Zhou Wen might use.</p>
<p>1</p>
<h3 id='chapter1697'>Chapter 1697: Hidden Star Palace</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived in front of the long stairs. He naturally wouldn’t unsummon Truth Listener. It would only be more troublesome to summon it again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Truth Listener wasn’t afraid of these strange taboos at all. It was even better than his Teacher Domain. He didn’t need to do anything; the ability to drain Essence Energy along the long flight of stairs was useless against him.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately became excited when they saw Human Sovereign take Truth Listener up the long flight of stairs without any intention of unsummoning it.</p>
<p>“Sect Master Gu’s mouth is indeed blessed. From the looks of it, Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast isn’t afraid of the Essence Energy draining ability along the stairs.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just the Companion Beast that isn’t afraid. Human Sovereign definitely isn’t afraid either. This is quite impressive.”</p>
<p>As expected, Human Sovereign easily led Truth Listener to the end of the long flight of stairs and pushed open the door to Alkaid Star Palace.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast is just so cool. It’s practically domineering. All kinds of powers are useless against it. What kind of Companion Beast is this? I’ve never heard of such a Companion Beast,” Su Yi said excitedly.</p>
<p>Professor Gu was a little embarrassed, so he stopped talking. He didn’t know what was wrong with him today; no matter how he analyzed it, it was wrong. Professor Gu thought to himself, It’s best if I don’t talk too much. This Human Sovereign really doesn’t play by the rules.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed open the Star Palace’s door and walked in with Truth Listener who delivered another explosive punch. This was under the condition that Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to hold back. Otherwise, even the Star Palace would probably be wrecked.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, that works? Karoman fought for a few minutes, but it just takes a punch to finish him off?”</p>
<p>“This Companion Beast is nuts!”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for strategy or plan. Just blow it up with one punch.”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign’s the best. Even Sect Master Gu can’t jinx him. He was so steady, clearing the seven Star Palaces so casually.”</p>
<p>“No matter how I look at it, this Companion Beast is stronger than Karoman. Although he relied on a Companion Beast to clear the levels, it’s too amazing. It should have a chance of vying for first place on the rankings, right?”</p>
<p>“Can I ask where I can get such a Companion Beast?”</p>
<p>“Stop dreaming. Ignoring the fact that such a Companion Beast is definitely unique, even if there’s a place to obtain it, you don’t have the ability to obtain it.”</p>
<p>Everyone was awestruck. Truth Listener’s domineering style left them wanting for more.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, do you think Human Sovereign has a chance of getting first place?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu.</p>
<p>Professor Gu cleared his throat and said conservatively, “In theory, the score obtained from using a Companion Beast to clear the level is lower than clearing it individually. The more Companion Beasts used, the lower the score. However, Human Sovereign only used one Companion Beast. Furthermore, he cleared the level in a steamrolling manner. His score shouldn’t be low, so he has a chance of vying for first place.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Professor Gu couldn’t hold it in any longer. He continued, “However, Human Sovereign has already seen the abilities of all the Starlords. The difficulty of clearing the level definitely can’t compare to Karoman, who cleared the Star Palace on his first attempt. If Human Sovereign was the first person to clear the seven Star Palaces, he would definitely be first on the rankings. Now, there’s still some suspense.”</p>
<p>The meaning behind Professor Gu’s words was that although Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast was very strong, he had benefited from Karoman and hadn’t cleared the unknown Star Palace himself.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. After all, it’s only a matter of one punch. Even if he hadn’t seen Karoman clear the level, Human Sovereign can clear it as he pleases. I bet that Human Sovereign will definitely be at the top of the rankings.”</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a pity. If only Human Sovereign had come out earlier.”</p>
<p>Just as people were discussing if Human Sovereign could reach the top of the rankings, they saw him arrive in front of a mini star in the Star Palace. Truth Listener reached out to push the mini star, causing it to spin.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing?” It wasn’t just the average person. Even the people from the various factions were puzzled. They didn’t know why Human Sovereign wasn’t leaving after clearing the level.</p>
<p>Junior Brother, what are you trying to do? Hui Haifeng was already very satisfied with Zhou Wen’s performance. Although he hadn’t taken action himself, it was already very commendable for him to use a Companion Beast to surpass Karoman’s limelight.</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s puzzlement, the mini star emitted a blue light that transformed into a blue beam that shone on the teleportation nexus, dyeing it ice-blue.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, what’s Human Sovereign doing?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“No way. Could there be something fishy with the Big Dipper Palaces?”</p>
<p>Many people widened their eyes as they watched the magical changes in the Star Palace.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked into the teleportation nexus with Truth Listener, the scene on the Cube changed to the North Star and the ice palace.</p>
<p>“Heavens, there’s actually another Star Palace?”</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, there’s a hidden Star Palace?”</p>
<p>“How did Human Sovereign know?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the Internet was filled with surprised comments as a series of question marks flooded the screen.</p>
<p>Professor Gu was dumbfounded. He had just said that Human Sovereign hadn’t cleared an unknown Star Palace himself, but it ended up with him activating an unknown Star Palace.</p>
<p>Now, Professor Gu wished he could slap himself twice. He regretted saying that last sentence.</p>
<p>“This Starlord looks so cool. What Starlord is this?”</p>
<p>“Lad, you don’t usually read, right? It’s obvious that you aren’t cultured. The star corresponding to the Big Dipper is definitely the North Star. And the North Star has the name of the Purple Star Palace. I guess this Star Palace should be the Purple Star Palace. Lord Human Sovereign is indeed a genius who knows everything about astronomy and geology. He must have used Purple Star Astrology to figure out the hidden Star Palace. I’m getting more impressed with him.”</p>
<p>“This is the true sovereign of humanity. There’s no need for him to enter the Star Palaces personally. He can deduce the hidden Star Palace with just a snap of his fingers. A cultured person is just that confident.”</p>
<p>Many people were about to turn Human Sovereign into a myth. Unbeknown to them, Zhou Wen knew nothing about Purple Star Astrology.</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign actually knows Purple Star Astrology?” Zhang Chunqiu wore a look of shock.</p>
<p>Purple Star Astrology was also known as the number one form of divination, a field meant to serve an emperor. The Zhang family also studied Purple Star Astrology, but there weren’t many people who were truly proficient in it. Yet, Human Sovereign actually knew it and seemed to be very proficient in it. This left him somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>It was impossible to deduce the existence of the hidden Star Palace from the layout of the miniature stars in the Star Palace and find the star that could open a hidden dimensional zone among the countless miniature stars if one didn’t know Purple Star Astrology.</p>
<p>“What does this fellow not know?” Xia Liuchuan’s face was filled with envy and jealousy.</p>
<p>In the Wang family, Wang Lu wore a look of worry as she prayed silently. I hope nothing happens.</p>
<p>Compared to others’ curiosity about the hidden Star Palace, Wang Lu was more worried about Zhou Wen’s safety. She had long known that Human Sovereign was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“The dangers of the hidden Star Palace are unknown. Young Master Wen is too rash.” An Sheng also wore a look of worry.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo didn’t say a word, but his eyes were also filled with worry.</p>
<p>3</p>
<h3 id='chapter1698'>Chapter 1698 Sovereign of Humanity</h3>
<p>“What a pity. It looks like your position as first place will change hands.” In the Family Clan of Gods, Mohe looked at Karoman and smiled.</p>
<p>“Since I know that there’s a hidden Star Palace, the first place will be mine sooner or later. Furthermore, it’s hard to say if he can clear the hidden Star Palace. Just a Companion Beast might not be able to deal with all situations,” said Karoman indifferently.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke, Starlady Polestar opened her eyes in the Star Palace. Stars appeared in the sky and transformed into countless starlight beams that shot down, instantly lighting up the world. The entire Star Palace seemed to have turned into an endless universe. The entire Cube’s screen was occupied by the gorgeous starlight.</p>
<p>The calm expression on the face of Karoman changed immediately. Such an aura and form of strength were definitely not something the Starlords of the previous seven Star Palaces could compare with.</p>
<p>“Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array!” Zhang Chunqiu, who had always been calm, exclaimed involuntarily.</p>
<p>Even the low-level ordinary people could tell that this Starlady was very different when they saw the power that resembled the primordial universe.</p>
<p>Under the aura of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, the average person felt as tiny as an ant or a speck of dust. Even through the screen, despair spread in their hearts.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Golden streams of light erupted in the starlight like a golden flash that streaked across the galaxy. The battle had finally begun.</p>
<p>It was like a galaxy exploding as countless stars bloomed. Not to mention ordinary people, even the Calamity-grade representatives could hardly see what was happening inside.</p>
<p>As Karoman watched, he felt his body turn cold. His inner wear was drenched in cold</p>
<p>sweat.</p>
<p>There’s no way to fight her! These were the only words in Karoman’s heart. If he were to fight Starlady Polestar, he would probably be instantly killed.</p>
<p>“What the hell? Is Human Sovereign really that strong?” Xia Liuchuan’s mouth gaped open for a long time.</p>
<p>He couldn’t see the battle, but to be able to survive at such a level proved that Human Sovereign’s strength was extremely powerful. Xia Liuchuan knew very well that if he were to watch the battle inside, he would probably be reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>“Is Young Master Wen already that strong?” An Sheng’s face was filled with joy.</p>
<p>“All he knows is to show off all day. It’s as though he’s afraid that others won’t know who he is.” An Tianzuo’s tone was cold, but the corners of his mouth subconsciously curled up, forming a very beautiful arc.</p>
<p>Few humans could understand a battle at this level. Those who could were also alarmed.</p>
<p>“Has he already reached such a level?” In an uninhabited ancient city, an elder narrowed his eyes as he watched the battle on the Cube. It was none other than Jing Daoxian, who hadn’t appeared in a long time.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Jing Daoxian stopped and turned to leave. He muttered to himself, “From the looks of it, I have to be faster. Otherwise, I really won’t be able to keep up with this era.”</p>
<p>Everyone watching the battle felt the same. A chill ran down their spines as they couldn’t stop the fear in their hearts. Some with weaker willpower were trembling.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic clash made everyone feel tiny and powerless.</p>
<p>“This is what makes a f*cking Calamity!” It was unknown who sent such a comment. This sentence began to appear on all the programs on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Professor Gu, what level is this battle? Is this still at the Calamity grade?” Su Yi was dazzled as she muttered.</p>
<p>“I can only say that such a battle has already exceeded any known powerhouse at this stage. I have to apologize for my words. To be able to participate in such a battle, even if Human Sovereign doesn’t fight personally, it’s enough to prove that his strength is above all known humans.”</p>
<p>Professor Gu continued with a solemn expression, “If he really has a pure human body and hasn’t contracted a Guardian, then Human Sovereign is undoubtedly the sovereign of humanity. Such strength might meet its match in the future, but it’s definitely unprecedented. Only now do I know why Human Sovereign didn’t personally fight the Starlords from before. It’s because he finds it beneath him to do so. It’s just like a lofty emperor who doesn’t personally kill ordinary people. Those Starlords aren’t worthy of him taking action personally.”</p>
<p>“Now, I only hope that Human Sovereign can come out alive. If such a person dies in the Star Palace, it will be our greatest loss,” Professor Gu added with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“May the heavens bless us. Let Human Sovereign win!” Su Yi’s palms were sweaty from nervousness.</p>
<p>“May the heavens bless him!” This sentence flooded the screen. Looking at the terrifying cosmic starlight, many people began praying for Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>When the twelve Star Palaces appeared, everyone felt as though the end of the world had arrived. It was also as though a divine punishment had appeared to punish the world.</p>
<p>Even watching the livestream through the screen made one have the urge to kneel down and pray and repent.</p>
<p>The twelve Star Palaces slowly came crashing down. It was suffocating. The twelve Star Palaces were like the power of the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p>Everyone beneath the Heavenly Dao was an ant. Even the most unprecedented sage couldn’t escape the suppression of the heavens. Sooner or later, they would have to accept their fate.</p>
<p>“Don’t die!” Hui Haifeng’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as his eyes nearly popped out. They were bloodshot.</p>
<p>He regretted letting Zhou Wen step forward, but who the hell knew that Zhou Wen would do such a thing? If he really died inside, he wouldn’t know how to answer to himself.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan also stared intently at the screen. Xia Liuchuan, who always liked to tease and couldn’t keep his mouth shut, seemed to be mute. He couldn’t say a word.</p>
<p>It was an indescribable pressure. Everyone felt as though an inescapable mountain of fate was pressing down on their chests. They were so uncomfortable that they were about to suffocate. It was as though the sky was about to collapse as despair involuntarily filled their minds.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A dark-gold bolt of lightning shot up in defiance of the heavens, shattering a Star Palace. It was like the first ray of light in the extreme night, illuminating everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Explosions sounded incessantly as the Star Palaces that represented fate were blasted to pieces. It was like a thunderclap that entered their ears, making the people who were about to suffocate shatter the mountains that pressed down on their chests. They couldn’t help but tremble as the despair in their hearts gradually turned into excitement.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The moment the last Star Palace shattered, everyone’s bodies jolted before they heaved a long sigh as though they had put down a heavy burden.</p>
<p>The Star Palaces were destroyed as the starlight that filled the sky was extinguished. Only two figures remained standing proudly in the Star Palace. One of them looked up at the sky indifferently while the other was handsome and wild as he looked down at all life from above.</p>
<h3 id='chapter1699'>Chapter 1699 A Simple Name</h3>
<p>“Junior Brother, well done!” Hui Haifeng jumped up excitedly. The effect was much stronger than he had expected. It couldn’t be any more perfect.</p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary people, Human Sovereign was already a god-like existence. Truth Listener, who had blasted apart the twelve Star Palaces, made people love, fear, and envy him.</p>
<p>“Your daddy is ultimately your daddy. No matter how the times change, Human Sovereign is the strongest human. There’s no one else.”</p>
<p>“I’m dying of laughter. There was actually someone who wanted to compare Karoman to Human Sovereign? Is there a comparison?”</p>
<p>“Human Sovereign is mighty. This is the true number one expert of humanity. Those representatives are so weak.”</p>
<p>“Don’t brag yet. How do you know that Human Sovereign isn’t a representative? I think he’s basically a representative. Otherwise, how could he become so strong in such a short period of time?”</p>
<p>“Shut up. My Human Sovereign is definitely not a representative.”</p>
<p>While ordinary people engaged in a war of words on the Internet, the representatives, including Karoman, couldn’t say a word. Or rather, they were in no mood to speak.</p>
<p>Most of them had signed a contract with alien races to increase their strength. They originally imagined that they could become the top existences among humans, but Human Sovereign’s unparalleled strength made them feel like they had suddenly fallen from heaven to the mortal world.</p>
<p>“Which race is he the representative of?” After a long silence, Karoman finally spoke.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Karoman who was wondering. All the representatives and experts of the various factions believed that Human Sovereign was definitely a representative. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to reach such a level in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with talent, but resources. Without the resources provided by the dimension, it would probably take at least eight to nine years for humans to obtain them in the dimensional zones. It was impossible for even a Human Realm Calamity to appear, much less at a level like Human Sovereign.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at the Cube’s screen and waited for the moment the ranking appeared. They wanted to know which race Human Sovereign was the representative of.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the various factions on Earth. Even many terrifying existences in the dimension were looking at the Cube’s screen. They also wanted to know which race had nurtured such a human. From their point of view, nurturing a human like this was a huge investment.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what others thought. His mind was filled with</p>
<p>joy.</p>
<p>Emperor Star. Indeed, there’s an Emperor Star in reality. Starlady Polestar had dropped another Emperor Star in reality. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen put away the Emperor Star and teleported out of the Star Palace.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s departure, the Cube’s screen returned to the rankings.</p>
<p>Under the attention of everyone, the first place on the rankings changed hands as expected. Karoman was kicked to second place. However, when everyone saw the first name, they had the same reaction.</p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>
<p>The name in first place was very simpleHuman Sovereign. It was without any additional prefixes or postfixes. Such a simple name surprised countless people in the Federation.</p>
<p>As for the representatives and experts of the various factions, they only felt despair spread in their hearts.</p>
<p>“How is that possible… Human Sovereign isn’t a representative…” They couldn’t believe that a human could reach such a level at such a point in time without relying on the resources of the alien races.</p>
<p>However, they had no choice but to believe it. If Human Sovereign was really a representative of the dimensional races in the human world, then according to the contract, he had to add the name of the dimensional race on the rankings unless the contract Human Sovereign signed was different from theirs.</p>
<p>However, up to now, they had never heard of a different contract. All the human representatives on the rankings did so without exception. It was obvious that the contents of the contracts were about the same.</p>
<p>Instantly, many representatives wore odd expressions. In order to increase their strength, they had signed a contract with dimensional races and become their representatives.</p>
<p>However, they suddenly realized that a person who didn’t rely on the dimension to provide resources was already far ahead of them. This left them momentarily unable to accept the blow.</p>
<p>“Haha, I knew it. It’s impossible for Human Sovereign to be a representative of the dimension. As expected of my Human Sovereign.”</p>
<p>“Long live our sovereign!”</p>
<p>“Unbelievable. Human Sovereign should be able to defeat those representatives. He’s pure human. I really wonder how those representatives feel after obtaining so many resources, only to be trampled beneath Human Sovereign’s feet.”</p>
<p>“I want to say something, but I’m not cultured enough. There’s only two words in my mind-Human Sovereign is awesome.”</p>
<p>“Not only are you uncultured, but you also don’t know how to count. That’s clearly four words, alright?” The entire Federation boiled over. A human who wasn’t a representative had actually reached such a level. Furthermore, it was possible that he was a pure human. He hadn’t become a representative or contracted a Guardian. It was even possible that he hadn’t used the Mythical Serum. This was as perfect as a dream.</p>
<p>Of course, most people didn’t believe that Human Sovereign remained pure human. They were more willing to believe that Human Sovereign had made some sacrifices to reach this stage.</p>
<p>The various platforms that were originally discussing representatives now talked about Human Sovereign. Companion Beasts-a very popular phrase to begin with-once again exceeded the search numbers of representatives and became the most popular search.</p>
<p>As people didn’t know Truth Listener’s name, and due to someone giving it the nickname of “Crown Prince,” the Internet was calling it that. There were countless discussions about Truth Listener.</p>
<p>Not every human could be a representative, but everyone had a chance of obtaining a Companion Beast. They wanted to know how to obtain such a powerful Companion Beast. The existence of evolvable Companion Beasts had already become common knowledge. It was just difficult for ordinary people to obtain them, but no matter how difficult it was, there was still a chance of obtaining one. If one could nurture one to the level of Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast, wouldn’t they also become a top human expert?</p>
<p>“So what if I’m weak? It’s fine as long as my Companion Beast is strong enough. If you aren’t convinced, fight my Companion Beast! If you aren’t convinced, fight Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast!” Many people began to change their views. They no longer envied the experts who became representatives.</p>
<p>Although it was impossible to completely change this concept in an instant, it was a good start.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen is just so strong. It’s hard to imagine how he managed to reach this stage. He suffered so much in secret, but he never complained. Young Master Wen has had it hard,” An Sheng said with a sigh.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo remained silent. Zhou Wen’s growth was faster than he had imagined. He had truly become the cornerstone of the human race. He felt gratified as some kind of power grew in his body, causing his blood to heat up.</p>
<p>It’s time to go there. How can I fall behind him?</p>
