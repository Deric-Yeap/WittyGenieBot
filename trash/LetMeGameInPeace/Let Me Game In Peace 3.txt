<h3 id='chapter200'>Chapter 200 Thundergod General</h3>
<p>“Indeed. I’m just afraid that their passion will be unbearable when the time comes,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“The An family actually didn’t send An Jing. What’s the meaning behind sending an outsider? Are they afraid?” a stern-looking youth in black asked.</p>
<p>“The An family is smart. They didn’t send one of their own out of fear and got an outsider to let us vent our anger.” Another handsome young man with blonde hair wore a look of disdain.</p>
<p>“It looks like apart from An Tianzuo, there aren’t many talents in the An family. They actually found an outsider to enter the Holy Land. I feel sorry for the An family.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could tell from the number of youths speaking that he was in trouble this time.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, if you don’t wish to participate, it’s still not too late for you to quit. Madam has said that you should act according to the circumstances and don’t force it,” Ah Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen</p>
<p>“Since I’ve agreed to come, I can only take the challenge even if there’s a sea of fire ahead of me. There’s no reason for me to return now.” Although Zhou Wen spoke beautifully, he really didn’t wish to get involved if not for his attempt to see if the special physiques could enhance his physical stats.</p>
<p>Of course, he had to return the favor he owed. No matter what, he had to enter the Holy Land to take a look.</p>
<p>Ignoring the mockery and sarcasm of those people, Zhou Wen’s gaze constantly observed the so-called Holy Land, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>The so-called Holy Land was different from what Zhou Wen imagined. It didn’t have any magnificent ancient buildings or immortal-like paradises.</p>
<p>In a desolate desert, there was an ancient and worn-out stone platform. The stone platform was hexagonal and every edge had a stone pillar.</p>
<p>The six stone pillars had different symbols engraved on them. Even the carving techniques and styles were different, as though they were made by six different kinds of craftsmen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen failed to see any tiny palm symbol despite using Truth Listener to observe his surroundings for quite a while.</p>
<p>“Shut up. This isn’t a wet market. Whoever spouts any more nonsense will be disqualified.” The official coldly stopped everyone and continued, “Before coming here, your family has already informed you of the rules of the Holy Land. However, I still have to repeat them one more time. Everyone who enters the Holy Land does so voluntarily. If any mishaps happen in the Holy Land, it has nothing to do with the organizers of this trial. In other words, even if you die inside, no one will be responsible for it.”</p>
<p>With that said, the official looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “If anyone wishes to quit now, they can immediately make the request to not enter the Holy Land. However, once anyone enters the Holy Land, they need to be responsible for their actions. Good luck to them.”</p>
<p>Everyone knew very well that the official’s words were directed at Zhou Wen. With so many people targeting him, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have a good time after entering the Holy Land. The chances of death were much higher than the others.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had no intention of backing out, the official continued, “Since no one plans on quitting, this year’s Holy Battle will officially begin. In a while, the Companion Egg Market will begin business. If anyone needs a Companion Egg, you can purchase it. For the next twenty-four hours, you can enter the Holy Land at any time. As for whether you can leave the Holy Land alive, it will depend on your fate.”</p>
<p>After the official spoke, the trading market opened for business. Many merchants had set up stalls. On the stalls were various Companion Eggs. They were basically at the Legendary stage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw a few brands he was familiar with. They were all famous Companion Eggs retailers in the League.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, feel free to choose any Companion Egg you need. Madam has already prepared sufficient funds. It should be enough to buy all the Companion Eggs you need. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about money,” said Ah Sheng.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll just use my Companion Beasts,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Although the Companion Beasts that a person could obtain were unlimited, having a large number of them would be difficult to command in battle. It would be fine if a Companion Beast had high intelligence, but most Companion Beasts had low intelligence. If they were left to attack on their own, they would be a bunch of disorderly mobsters. They might not be able to use their powers and might even hinder each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, most people focused on training a few Companion Beasts, ones that they could use with the greatest ease.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already very adept at using his Companion Beasts. Furthermore, they were considered top-notch existences at the Legendary stage. It was enough.</p>
<p>“Madam was right. Indeed, you aren’t willing to buy Companion Eggs.” As Ah Sheng spoke, he took out a box and handed it to Zhou Wen. At the same time, he solemnly said, “Before I left, I was specifically instructed to hand it to you. Madam said that you can choose not to have any other Companion Egg, but this one was personally obtained by her in a dimensional zone. She said that you have to accept it no matter what. Otherwise, she will make you accompany her for meals daily when you return. Miss Jing will also join the meals.”</p>
<p>“Sis Lan sure is thoughtful.” Zhou Wen didn’t reject the offer and took the box.</p>
<p>He didn’t like the An siblings, but he wasn’t averse to Ouyang Lan. Since Ouyang Lan had said so, Zhou Wen didn’t reject the item.</p>
<p>When he opened it, he saw a black Companion Egg the size of a fist inside. It looked like metal, but it also had the luster of jade.</p>
<p>“What kind of Companion Egg is this?” Zhou Wen looked inside the box, but there was no information card.</p>
<p>“Madam didn’t tell me. She only said that you would know after you hatch it,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded but didn’t immediately incubate it. He stored it away in his backpack and said to Ah Sheng, “I’ll accept the Companion Egg. I’ll find an opportunity to hatch it in the future. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had a Dao Body and his Primordial Energy recovery speed was extremely fast. He could incubate Legendary Companion Eggs at any time, so he didn’t have to worry about the danger of expending too much of his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>“Alright, now that your matters have been resolved, and since you aren’t buying Companion Eggs, why don’t you accompany me to take a look. I don’t have as many excellent-grade Companion Eggs as you do. This is a good opportunity for me. Who knows, I might be able to obtain a few.” Li Xuan pulled Zhou Wen towards the market.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s words weren’t wild fantasy. In fact, as long as he had enough money, he could buy Legendary Companion Beasts that were usually rarely seen.</p>
<p>In order to leave an impression on these young people who could lead a future generation, many of the excellent-grade Companion Eggs were put on sale here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be astonished when he followed Li Xuan around. He had never heard of many of the Companion Eggs here, but from their introductions, many of them had very useful abilities. They were in no way inferior to the Mutated Demonized General before it underwent a fusion.</p>
<p>The Companion Eggs here were basically at that level. The prices were also astronomical and were at least twice the price of a typical Companion Egg shop.</p>
<p>Even so, many young people who were prepared to enter the Holy Land spent a huge sum of money to buy Companion Eggs. Their expressions remained stoic as though what they were spending wasn’t money.</p>
<p>“Thundergod General… There’s actually a Thundergod General here…” Suddenly, a voice sounded, attracting the attention of many.</p>
<h3 id='chapter201'>Chapter 201 Gold-Armored Beast</h3>
<p>The words “Thundergod General” seemed to contain infinite attraction. Many young people were attracted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company went over to take a look as well. After all, Thundergod General was a very famous Companion Beast. He had the reputation of being the best offensive pet, with potent offensive abilities. Be it his companion form or his pet form, he had extremely powerful attacks.</p>
<p>The most famous aspect of Thundergod General was his Primordial Energy Skill, Thundergod Augmentation. It could augment a person with lightning from the void, giving a person infinite power to battle an enemy. Every strike had terrifying lightning power accompanying it. It struck extreme fear into the hearts of people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even in his companion form, Thundergod Sword, Thundergod Augmentation could still be used. Even someone who had never cultivated a lightning-elemental Primordial Energy Skill would be able to use the Thundergod Sword that came with sword beams imbued with lightning</p>
<p>The reputation of Thundergod General as the number one Legendary offensive pet was definitely not unfounded. However, that was if one had the Thundergod Augmentation. However, Thundergod had a total of four skills, so even if one hatched him, he might not have Thundergod Augmentation.</p>
<p>Without the Thundergod Augmentation, Thundergod General was an ordinary Legendary Companion Beast. It was nothing compared to the best Legendary offensive pet.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether Thundergod General was worth anything depended on whether he had the Thundergod Augmentation skill.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the items sold here were all Companion Eggs. Even with X-ray vision, it was impossible to tell the stats or skills available to the Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>Hence, there were many onlookers, but none of them were willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>The price of a Thundergod General Companion Egg was two million. This was definitely not too much to buy the best Legendary offensive pet. However, if Thundergod General didn’t have Thundergod Augmentation when he was hatched, he would be worth at most a hundred thousand or so. Spending two million to buy it was no doubt a waste.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people just watched. It was very nicely priced. It made those who wanted to buy it still feel the pinch. Yet, they would find it unacceptable giving it up. After all, Thundergod General Companion Egg was extremely rare.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pretended to take a picture with his phone and glanced at Thundergod General Companion Egg’s stats. He discovered that it was Thundergod General with two skills, and one of the skills was the Thundergod Augmentation.</p>
<p>“If it’s a Thundergod General with Thundergod Augmentation, two million would be worth it. I’m just afraid it doesn’t have it. Spending two million for trash would be a terrible loss.” Li Xuan was also tempted.</p>
<p>“If you know that it has the Thundergod Augmentation skill, would you even have a chance of making a comment? It would long have been sold.” A blonde youth said disdainfully.</p>
<p>“That’s odd. Why are there dogs barking randomly in Holy City?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“Perhaps someone’s dog wasn’t tied up and ended up running out,” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>The blonde youth’s expression instantly darkened, but he didn’t turn hostile. He only said coldly, “Are the people from East District so uncultured?”</p>
<p>“For us from East District, that’s only reserved for the cultured,” Li Xuan said, unwilling to be outdone.</p>
<p>“Very good. I won’t argue with you. After we enter the Holy Land, we’ll settle the scores,” the blonde youth said without any expression.</p>
<p>“I’ll be your guest.” After Li Xuan said that, he ignored him. He looked at Thundergod General Companion Egg before asking Zhou Wen, “Unfortunately, Wang Lu isn’t here. With her luck, she would definitely be able to help me get one that has Thundergod Augmentation.”</p>
<p>“It’s only two million. That shouldn’t be a huge sum to you. It’s good to bet. If you score one and obtain the best Legendary offensive pet, it will be worth a lot more than two million.” Zhou Wen secretly nudged Li Xuan in the direction, hoping that he would buy the Thundergod General.</p>
<p>He already had Banana Fan and had recently picked up Bamboo Blade. He didn’t lack any weapons. As for offensive pets, his Mutated Demonized General was in no way inferior to the Thundergod General. There was no need to buy another one.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll take that bet.” Li Xuan gritted his teeth and bought the Thundergod General Companion Egg under everyone’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Two million to buy a Thundergod General Companion Egg. There are so many vulgarians in rural cities,” someone mocked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Although Thundergod General Companion Eggs were rare, they were only worth four to five hundred thousand on the market due to the low probability of possessing Thundergod Augmentation. Buying it for two million was indeed expensive. This was also why nobody had bought it despite the huge crowd.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan didn’t mind. He went shopping with Zhou Wen and Ah Sheng at other stalls. He had plenty of wealth and wasn’t stingy with his money. He bought several Legendary Companion Eggs consecutively.</p>
<p>“Will you have the time to incubate so many Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Since I can’t incubate it outside, I’ll take it into the Holy Land. After all, we need to stay in the Holy Land for at least ten days. There will be time.” Li Xuan seemed to be full of confidence, but he changed the topic and said, “However, I want to incubate Thundergod General before entering the Holy Land. I’m just too curious. I wonder if he has Thundergod Augmentation.”</p>
<p>There were rooms prepared by the League government. Li Xuan and company each requested a room while the former began incubating the Thundergod General Companion Egg</p>
<p>Zhou Wen already knew what the outcome would be, so he wasn’t too concerned. He sat down on the sofa in the living room and took out the Companion Egg Ouyang Lan had prepared for him. He glanced at it with his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Gold-Armored Beast: Legendary.</p>
<p>Life Providence: Steel Protection</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 11</p>
<p>Constitution: 20</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 12</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Tempered Steel.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Armor</p>
<p>Just by looking at the attributes, he knew that the Companion Beast was definitely an excellent-grade Legendary Companion Beast. Furthermore, it was one with an extremely high defense. It was very likely to be on par with the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior.</p>
<p>The most critical thing was that the Gold-Armored beast’s companion form was armor. It was obviously given to him by Ouyang Lan to save his life.</p>
<p>Li Xuan ran out from his room with a broadsword wrapped in lightning bolts as he shouted excitedly, “Jackpot… Jackpot… I never expected that I’d have such a day… Old Zhou… My Thundergod General has two skills… One of them is Thundergod Augmentation…”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you want the entire world to know that you have a true Thundergod General?” Zhou Wen was speechless.</p>
<p>“What’s the harm?” Although as Li Xuan said that, he quickly stowed Thundergod General away. With no one knowing, Thundergod General would make an excellent trump card.</p>
<p>They did some preparatory work before bidding Ah Sheng farewell, in preparation to head for the Holy Land’s entrance.</p>
<p>“Go in later. Head in when the twenty-four hours are almost up. That way, you can avoid meeting most people. They won’t wait that long since they will be vying for the qualifications,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen was very patient, so there was no rush.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan didn’t think so, he patiently waited for Zhou Wen to head in with him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously asked if Li Xuan wanted to head in himself to prevent him from being marked by the youths of the six hero families. However, Li Xuan didn’t mind at all. Since they came together, he believed that it was natural for them to enter together.</p>
<h3 id='chapter202'>Chapter 202 Sky Battle</h3>
<p>The way he entered the Holy Land made Zhou Wen question life. He and Li Xuan stood on a stone pillar, and the stone pillar descended like an elevator.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that the Holy Land was underground, but after the stone pillar’s long descent, he suddenly felt the ground beneath him give way. Then, he realized that he was in the air, surrounded by floating clouds with mountains beneath his feet.</p>
<p>How is this possible? We were clearly descending, so how did we end up in the sky? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he sized up the ground beneath him. Soon, he realized that the area below wasn’t Holy City’s territory.</p>
<p>There were no mountains near Holy City, but there were endless mountain ranges below.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t have the Godfiend Life Providence, so he didn’t have the ability to levitate, preventing him from examining his surroundings as Zhou Wen did. Instead, he summoned a huge eagle pet and landed on its back. At the same time, he flew towards Zhou Wen and pulled him onto the back of the giant eagle.</p>
<p>“How magical. This is the Holy Land, a sacred place. No one knows where the Holy Land is, but It’s definitely not underground anyway,” Li Xuan said, as he looked at the surrounding mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>“Which Holy Temple are you going to?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I cultivate in the Invincible Connate Divine Art. This Primordial Energy Art corresponds to the Connate Infinite physique, so I’ll be going to the Connate Holy Temple.” Li Xuan replied, “It’s highly likely that the An family made you cultivate the Sun Strafe Art, right? In that case, you should go to the Sun Divine Temple. However, from the looks of it, your Primordial Energy doesn’t look like it’s of the Sun Strafe Art pedigree.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never cultivated the Sun Strafe Art, so it doesn’t matter where I go. Since you are going to the Connate Holy Temple, I’ll go somewhere else to try my luck.” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t willing to compete with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Every physique only chose one person. If Zhou Wen snatched it away, Li Xuan would definitely not have one.</p>
<p>“Alright, where shall we meet later?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided where to go for the time being. If there’s nothing special, let’s meet up after we exit this place.” If Zhou Wen wanted to vie for the special physique, he probably had to fight the youths from the six heroes’ families. He was unwilling to involve Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll accompany you to find a suitable Holy Temple. After all, the test lasts ten days. It doesn’t matter when one visits it. I’m not in a rush either,” Li Xuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing how Li Xuan insisted on accompanying him, Zhou Wen could only say, “If that’s the case, let’s head to the Connate Holy Temple first.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony as he let the giant eagle fly east.</p>
<p>Shortly after they flew off, they saw more than ten people riding on flying mounts. Leading them was someone Zhou Wen still remembered. It was none other than Saint John from the Cape family.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, do you think you can escape trouble just by entering late?” John said coldly, as he rode on a flying lion.</p>
<p>As they spoke, the group had already surrounded Zhou Wen and Li Xuan in all directions. Unable to charge out of the encirclement, the giant eagle could only spiral around in the middle.</p>
<p>“John, if you wish to have another battle, I’ll take up your challenge any time.” Zhou Wen shot Li Xuan a glance. Li Xuan immediately understood and controlled the giant eagle to land on the ground.</p>
<p>“Trying to run? Aren’t you an overly naive one.” John sneered as he gave the order. More than ten people together with their Companion Beasts attacked simultaneously.</p>
<p>Without a word, Zhou Wen summoned the banana fan and sent a gust of Grand Yin Wind at John.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t prepared the last time, allowing you to successfully sneak an attack on me with your Companion Beast. This time, you won’t have another chance.” John clearly came prepared. Upon seeing Zhou Wen’s Grand Yin Wind approach, he didn’t fluster or show any intention of dodging.</p>
<p>When the Grand Yin wind reached John, it was as if it had encountered an invisible barrier that splashed sideways. No damage was dealt to John nor the lion beast that he was sitting on.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly surprised and he found it odd. However, time didn’t permit him to ponder over the reason. The attacks of the other ten plus Companion Beasts had already circled him, nearly sealing off all routes of retreat for him and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to go all out, he suddenly heard a young bird’s tender chirping. It was the yellow-feathered chick.</p>
<p>This fellow had been following Zhou Wen all this time. As it stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder, a mere chirp was enough to make the dozen or so flying pets suddenly lose control and be thrown into disarray like a kite with a broken string.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a careful look and knew that it was all thanks to the yellow-feathered chick. The flying Companion Beasts who were randomly flying about were all birds. Only a minority, like John’s flying lion, wasn’t affected.</p>
<p>With the opponent’s lineup in chaos, there was a weakness to exploit despite the attacks of the ones remaining. Li Xuan controlled the giant eagle to rush out of the encirclement and quickly landed on a nearby mountain.</p>
<p>“Chase after him.” John gritted his teeth and chased after him. The dozen or so disciples of the six hero families also joined in the chase.</p>
<p>“John, are you really going to fight me to the death?” Zhou Wen stood on the back of the giant eagle as he stared at the chasing John.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to die. We are very fair. Back then, An Tianzuo injured our family members. Now, since you are here on behalf of the An family, we will also be very fair. All we need to do is cripple your Primordial Energy sea and maim you,” John said coldly.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo had crippled your family members once. Don’t force me to do the same thing,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the approaching John.</p>
<p>“Haha, do you really think you’re An Tianzuo? You’re just representing the An family. Your name isn’t An Tianzuo. The pets you rely on are completely useless against me. Who are you to act so arrogantly in front of me?” John held his sword as he began to condense Light of Judgment. He was prepared to finish Zhou Wen and company in midair, preventing them from having a chance to escape back to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he took out the Bamboo Blade. With one hand holding the scabbard and the other holding the hilt, he said to Li Xuan, “You leave first.” Then, he leaped up and flew towards John who was charging at him.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what are you doing?” Li Xuan was alarmed. He wanted to stop Zhou Wen, but it was too late.</p>
<p>“So you have a death wish.” John knew that when fighting in the sky, the death sentence was practically given to those without a flying mount. Without any hesitation, he slashed out with his sword, transforming into a gigantic sword beam that tore towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The few youths behind him who weren’t using avian mounts also used their own Primordial Energy Skills. Together with John, they surrounded Zhou Wen. Several beams of light instantly intersected with each other, nearly sealing off all possible routes of retreat for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>This was difficult to avoid even on land, much less when in the air.</p>
<h3 id='chapter203'>Chapter 203 A Man Doesn’t Need Wings!</h3>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you won’t be able to escape today even if you have wings. I will return the humiliation you made me suffer at Sunset College with interest.” The Sword of Judgment in John’s hand slashed down.</p>
<p>More than ten Companion Beasts spat out all sorts of light blasts as they worked with the humans to attack the encircled Zhou Wen in the air. From the looks of it, it was impossible for him to escape.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Zhou Wen continued to rise with Bamboo Blade in hand. At the instant Light of Judgment and the numerous attacks were about to land on him, Zhou Wen exerted strength in his legs as though he had stepped on an invisible staircase in the air. He accelerated rapidly and changed his trajectory to avoid John’s Light of Judgment.</p>
<p>John and company thought they were seeing things. John was right. Zhou Wen was indeed unable to escape if he had wings. Even a real bird would probably not be able to escape the encirclement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t have any wings on his back, but he seemed to be walking on flat ground in the air. It was as though he could move as he pleased.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen moved erratically in the sky. In a completely impossible situation, he tore through John and company’s encirclement and, like a ghost, rushed in front of a youth riding on a flying bird.</p>
<p>The youth wasn’t a weakling either. He drew his saber and slashed at Zhou Wen, condensing potent battle aura into a corporeal blade beam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spun like an eagle as he dodged the attack, brushing past the bird.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade instantly unsheathed itself and flashed like a cold beam of light. After Zhou Wen flew several meters away, the bird split into two and blood splattered across the sky.</p>
<p>Instantly, John and company felt their bodies turn cold. It wasn’t as if they had never seen anyone with better movement techniques and saber techniques than Zhou Wen, but in the sky, to be able to fly freely without any external help was terrifying. It would be courting death to fight someone like him in the sky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they came to that realization too late. Zhou Wen was like a specter in the sky as his body flashed. He slashed out again and again with Bamboo Blade, aiming for the mounts instead of their owners.</p>
<p>Just as John had said, if one did not have a mount in the sky, death was almost a certainty.</p>
<p>Those who relied on their mounts clearly couldn’t be as agile as Zhou Wen. With the difficulty of dodging plaguing them, they watched their own mounts being killed.</p>
<p>Blood filled the sky, and feathers poured down like snow. The youth whose mount had been sliced apart cried out tragically as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Everyone, return to the ground!” John shouted out loudly, feeling extremely infuriated. He originally thought that killing Zhou Wen in midair was a plan that would be foolproof, but who knew that this would end up becoming their greatest disadvantage?</p>
<p>“Ah!” Tragic screams were heard constantly as people fell onto boulders, fracturing their legs.</p>
<p>Only a few people with backup flying pets and flying equipment were spared.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these fellows were all from the families of the Six League Heroes, and were the children of the League’s wealthiest. They had plenty of good things on them, so they didn’t fall to their deaths. The ones that had been roped in to make up the numbers suffered terribly from the fall.</p>
<p>John tried his best to control his flying lion, hoping to land back on the ground, but Zhou Wen was too agile in the air. He eventually managed to cleave off the head of the flying lion.</p>
<p>John was infuriated as a pair of snow-white wings sprouted from his back. However, he didn’t charge at Zhou Wen and he sped towards the ground.</p>
<p>Even with wings, John didn’t dare fight Zhou Wen in midair. The mobility his wings gave him was on a completely different level from Zhou Wen’s aerial combat ability.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen let him off? The saber was like a rainbow as it chopped at John repeatedly. Although it wasn’t able to kill him, it had severed one of his wings.</p>
<p>John lost control of his body and fell to the mountain peak below. He almost broke his bones in the process.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was dumbfounded as he could not help but laugh out loud. “Indeed, you can’t escape even if you have wings. John, you’re really an honest person.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no intention of letting them off. He charged straight for the mountain peak and landed on it.</p>
<p>The group blamed the terrible loss they suffered for their immobility in the sky. So now that Zhou Wen had dared to land, they didn’t miss this opportunity and immediately surrounded him.</p>
<p>A stocky man held a huge shield with one hand and a huge hammer in the other as he charged straight at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t draw his saber. Instead, he struck out with a gust of Grand Yin Wind with the banana fan, sending the man’s hammer and shield flying.</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the man slammed into the mountain like a cannonball, creating a crater in the wall. His hammer and shield flew out of his hand as blood spewed out of his mouth. His hair and brows were covered in a layer of frost.</p>
<p>After struggling a few times, the man was unable to stand up.</p>
<p>As expected. There’s something on John that counters the Grand Yin Wind, preventing him from suffering its effects. After coming to this realization, Zhou Wen had switched his Primordial Energy Art into Dao Sutra. His Life Providence then turned into the Dao Body that could constantly restore his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>Seeing a few more people charging at him, Zhou Wen waved his fan again. The few of them were instantly blown away and their bones fractured from the fall. They rolled on the ground screaming.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had taken care of the dozen or so people with a few flaps of the fan, John turned around and tried to escape.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to fight me?” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to let him off as he slashed his Bamboo Blade at John’s back with a cold beam.</p>
<p>John raised his sword to block, one that was transformed from a Legendary Companion Egg. Bamboo Blade immediately snapped it and didn’t stop as it hit John’s armor, leaving a foot-long wound on his armor. Blood immediately gushed out.</p>
<p>John’s expression changed drastically. As he retreated, he summoned his Companion Beast, hoping to fend off Zhou Wen. Unfortunately, he was already in a state of frenzy. He had no intention of using the Companion Beasts to battle Zhou Wen. All he wanted was for them to hold Zhou Wen back so that he could escape.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand shimmered as the Legendary Companion Beasts were cleanly sliced through with a single slash. Before John could run far, Zhou Wen’s palm struck his back, sending blood spewing from him as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Read latest chapters at Wuxiaworld.site</p>
<p>It only took moments to have more than ten people collapsed on the ground. Not a single one of them could get up.</p>
<p>“Kill me if you have the guts!” John shouted angrily when he saw Zhou Wen stepping on his chest.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t killing you be too easy on you?” Zhou Wen thrust out his Bamboo Blade and pierced through John’s Primordial Energy sea.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, this isn’t over.” John wailed in excruciating pain, eager to rip Zhou Wen to shreds.</p>
<p>“You aren’t qualified,” Zhou Wen said coldly. He waved his Bamboo Blade once again and tore off John’s armor, revealing a strange necklace around John’s neck.</p>
<p>There was crystal embedded in the necklace, and within the crystal, there seemed to be swirling wind. It formed a vortex within, making it look rather special.</p>
<p>It looks like it was this item that caused Grand Yin Wind to lose its effects. Zhou Wen raised his saber and broke the necklace’s latch, allowing it to fall into his hands.</p>
<h3 id='chapter204'>Chapter 204 The Goddess of Wind’s Protection</h3>
<p>Li Xuan’s eyes lit up when he saw the necklace. He could not help but cry out, “IS that the Goddess of Wind’s Protection?”</p>
<p>“You know what this is?” Zhou Wen asked as he held the necklace.</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard that there are extraordinary treasures in some dimensional zones. Those treasures possess magical powers. The Goddess of Wind’s Protection is one of them. Legend has it that it’s a magical necklace that possesses the power of the wind. Wearing it can give you damage immunity from any wind element. However, according to what I know, the Goddess of Wind’s Protection likely belongs to the Qamar family. Furthermore, it’s unique, so I’ve no idea if it’s real or not,” Li Xuan explained.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s real or fake.” Zhou Wen stuffed the necklace into his pocket. Since this item could resist the Grand Yin Wind, he naturally didn’t want anyone else to possess it.</p>
<p>When John saw this scene, he was so angry that he vomited blood.</p>
<p>The necklace was indeed the Goddess of Wind’s Protection. In order to counter Zhou Wen’s banana fan, Member of Parliament Cape had paid a huge price to borrow it from the Qamar family. Now, it had been snatched away by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored John as he walked towards the others with the Bamboo Blade in hand. He ignored their pleas or insults as he stabbed through their Primordial Energy sea. Quite a number of people fainted either from the pain or anger.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, help me search. They must have bought quite a number of Companion Eggs at the market before they came. Let’s see if they still have any on them.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he personally pulled away a young man’s clothes and found two Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony either as he rummaged through the bodies of the rest. Soon, they had found 14 Companion Eggs which were likely at the Legendary stage. As for what type they were, it wasn’t possible for them to tell immediately.</p>
<p>John and company seethed in anger with clenched teeth. Back then, An Tianzuo had crippled his peers, but he didn’t do anything else. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were even more ruthless. Not only did he cripple them, he even took everything from them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” After searching, Zhou Wen turned around and left, ignoring John and company.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, what sort of movement technique was that? It’s way too cool. You actually managed to float in midair like Superman,” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen as he looked at him enviously. Clearly, he was somewhat tempted.</p>
<p>“That’s not a movement technique. Unless you give up the Invincible Connate Divine Art, you can forget about it,” Zhou Wen told a half-truth.</p>
<p>Even if Li Xuan was willing to give up the Invincible Connate Divine Art, he might not be able to master the Godfiend Era. Zhou Wen’s Godfiend Era was simulated by the Lost Immortal Sutra, not that he had succeeded in cultivating it.</p>
<p>When Li Xuan heard that, he heaved a sigh of relief and said depressingly, “Forget it. Although flying in the air is very cool, I’m not bad either.”</p>
<p>The two of them headed east. They knew that Connate Holy Temple was in the east from maps drawn by their predecessors. However, the exact location was unclear.</p>
<p>Every time someone entered the Holy Land, the map they drew was different, but the general location of the Holy Temples Temple was never wrong.</p>
<p>There were no dimensional creatures in the Holy Land, so the duo didn’t encounter any danger. After walking for more than half a day, they saw a sea in front of them. On the cliff by the seaside stood an ancient purple building.</p>
<p>“It should be there.” Li Xuan was delighted as he got Zhou Wen to rush over.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the ancient building, there were already several youths standing in front of the building. Clearly, they were all here to receive the Connate Holy Temple’s test.</p>
<p>When they saw Zhou Wen, they were slightly taken aback. They were somewhat suspicious, as though they were wondering how Zhou Wen had managed to come this far.</p>
<p>From their expressions, Zhou Wen knew that these people definitely knew that John was about to besiege him and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you sure are lucky. You actually weren’t stopped by John and the rest,” said a black-robed youth coldly.</p>
<p>“My luck has always been pretty good,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“However, your luck has come to an end. My goal is An Jing. I found it beneath me to fight you, but since she didn’t come and that useless bum, John, failed to stop you, I just can’t let you return whole now that you have come to me yourself. I have to leave some mark on you to show An Tianzuo when you return,” the youth in black said arrogantly.</p>
<p>“What’s with all the nonsense? If you want to attack, hurry up. Don’t delay us from accepting the Connate Holy Temple’s test,” Zhou Wen said casually.</p>
<p>Without another word, the black-robed youth released terrifying black flames from his body. He threw a punch at Zhou Wen like an erupting volcano.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t use the banana fan. Instead, he switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Ancient Imperial Sutra and struck out with Ashen Palm, meeting the black-robed youth’s fist.</p>
<p>As their fist and palm met, the youth in black felt a scorching pain in his visceral organs. He opened his mouth and spat out a large pool of blood as his body limply collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>The smiles on the faces of the youths beside him froze and a chill ran down their spines.</p>
<p>They knew the strength of the black-robed youth very well. He was rather famous among the six hero families and was in no way inferior to John. However, he couldn’t even withstand Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>Could this be another An Tianzuo? They had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>In the middle of the mountains, a beautiful butterfly leisurely flew past and, surprisingly, there was a person sitting on its back.</p>
<p>As the butterfly flew, the person revealed a look of surprise. The butterfly changed its direction and landed on a mountain peak.</p>
<p>More than ten people were lying on the mountaintop, moaning in pain. It was John’s group.</p>
<p>“Lance, you’re finally here!” John was overjoyed when he saw the person on the butterfly’s back.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Lance looked at John and the others while asking in surprise.</p>
<p>“We had our Primordial Energy sea destroyed by Zhou Wen. He even stole our things…” John recounted what had happened through gritted teeth. Finally, he pleaded. “That Zhou Wen has powerful Companion Beasts aiding him and we weren’t his match. Now, you are the only one who can maintain the dignity of our six hero families. Perhaps no one else is his match.”</p>
<p>“This Zhou Wen is rather interesting, but I’ve already said that I’m not interested in him. Furthermore, you were the ones who went knocking on his door and ended up being crippled by him. You only have yourselves to blame for your lacking skills.” As Lance spoke, he patted the butterfly beneath him and it immediately rose up and left the mountain.</p>
<p>John and the others were stunned. They didn’t expect that Lance would actually disregard the solidarity between the six hero families.</p>
<h3 id='chapter205'>Chapter 205 The Holy Temple’s Invitation</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen sat on the stone steps outside the Connate Holy Temple to game while Li Xuan entered to take the test.</p>
<p>The youth in black and the few others had long disappeared. The youth’s Primordial Energy sea had been destroyed and he had even had his possessions robbed from him. They didn’t dare stay here any longer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed that he had died once again at the hands of the Golden Flying Ant. He didn’t know how many times he had been killed by it; yet, he had failed to touch the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really wanted to know what was inside the white cocoon.</p>
<p>“Why are you the only one here? Did no one else come here to the Connate Holy Temple?” Just as Zhou Wen was about to restart his game, he saw a man descending on a butterfly. The man glanced at the sealed temple door and then looked at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“There’s another person inside the holy temple,” Zhou Wen replied when he saw that the man didn’t harbor any ill intentions.</p>
<p>After alighting from the butterfly’s back, Lance unsummoned the butterfly and looked at Zhou Wen’s phone. “I enjoy playing mobile games too. However, I play fighting games. These kinds of repetitive games aren’t suitable for me.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Lance took out his cell phone and launched a game. “It’s a pity that the magnetic field here is too unstable and causes excessive signal interference. Otherwise, we could network and play together.”</p>
<p>“I don’t play fighting games, ” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s such a pity.” Lance seemed a little disappointed as he sat down on the steps beside him. As he gamed, he asked, “Are you also interested in the Connate Holy Temple?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just accompanying a friend here to take a look. Are you also here to accept its test?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Well, not really. I’m only here to see what the Connate Holy Temple looks like. I have no intention of receiving the Connate Holy Temple’s special physique.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found this person rather interesting. As he spoke, he played games. His actions and thoughts didn’t conflict, and his handling was extremely fine. This wasn’t something an ordinary person could do.</p>
<p>“Since you came to the Connate Holy Temple, why don’t you give it a try? Perhaps there might be a chance of obtaining a Connate Infinite physique,” Zhou Wen asked with interest.</p>
<p>While playing games, Lance said, “It’s not only the Connate Infinite physique, I’m actually not interested in any of the special physiques in the Holy Land. It’s just that my family insists that I come. So, I came to take a look and since I’m here, I might as well visit all the Holy Temples. I’ll just treat it as a vacation.”</p>
<p>“You sure are interesting.” Zhou Wen found this person interesting.</p>
<p>“You’re very interesting too. I’ve heard of people vying for the nominations here in the Holy Land, but never about someone here to accompany their friend,” Lance said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I plan on vying for them too, but I don’t have my sights on the Connate Infinite physique,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Lance lowered his phone and sized up Zhou Wen for a moment before saying, “The six types of physiques in the Holy Land have their own advantages and weaknesses. This Connate Infinite physique has very high requirements on one’s body, so ordinary people are unable to meet the requirements. According to what I know, in the League, only those who cultivate in the Invincible Connate Divine Art can barely meet the requirements. From the looks of it, you don’t look like someone who cultivates in it. Your aura is a little odd. I’m afraid it’s not compatible with any of the Holy Temples’ special physiques. If you wish to vie for one, the difficulty might be higher than the others.”</p>
<p>“Human effort can achieve anything.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to elaborate on his matters, but he was rather interested in Lance. He asked, “Why don’t you want a special physique? This is something many want to vie for.”</p>
<p>“It’s precisely because everyone wants it. It’s been so many years and although there aren’t many people with the six special physiques in the League, there are still quite a number of them. There’s no point in me obtaining what others have. It’s rather pointless so I might as well not get it. Besides, An Tianzuo of the An family doesn’t have any special physiques. Yet, he can suppress his peers. And if he can do it, so can I.” Lance seldom shared such thoughts, but for some reason, he mentioned it in passing to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Upon hearing An Tianzuo’s name, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.</p>
<p>“You know An Tianzuo?” Lance acutely guessed that Zhou Wen knew An Tianzuo from his expression.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we aren’t on good terms. If you wish to ask me about him, I’m afraid you will be disappointed,” Zhou Wen said with a</p>
<p>shrug.</p>
<p>“There’s no need… There’s no need… Please don’t tell me anything about An Tianzuo.” Lance hurriedly waved his hands.</p>
<p>“Why is that?” Zhou Wen looked at Lance in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I will personally defeat him in the future. If I hear about him now, it will be too boring if I end up learning about his weaknesses. The An Tianzuo I want to defeat is the strongest An Tianzuo I can face,” said Lance solemnly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought to himself, From the looks of it, this person should also be from the six hero families. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be thinking about defeating An Tianzuo all day. However, it’s strange. Doesn’t he know that I’m the one coming on behalf of the An family?</p>
<p>After chatting for a while, they seemed to get along pretty well. They also talked about their experience in cultivation and martial techniques. Although they understood things differently, their shared concepts that were congruent with each other.</p>
<p>As the two were chatting, they suddenly saw the door to the temple open. Li Xuan walked out.</p>
<p>“How was it?” Zhou Wen got up and asked.</p>
<p>“I passed, but I’ve no idea if anyone will have better results than mine. We’ll know in ten days,” Li Xuan said with a smile. “I’m done. Which holy temple do you want to head to? I’ll accompany you.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Li Xuan saw Lance. Clearly, he didn’t know him. Seeing that he and Zhou Wen seemed to get along pretty well, he asked curiously, “Who is this? Someone you know?”</p>
<p>“I just got to know him.” Only then did Zhou Wen recall that he didn’t know of his name. Neither of them had said their names.</p>
<p>Lance stood up and said, “It’s time for me to go in. See you again if there’s a chance.”</p>
<p>However, before Lance could enter the Connate Holy Temple, a wyrm statue coiled around a stone pillar in front of the door suddenly opened its eyes. Its body moved as it came alive. It stretched out its head and stared at Zhou Wen. “Are you willing to be the representative of my Connate Holy Temple?”</p>
<p>The three of them were slightly taken aback. Lance looked at Zhou Wen with a strange expression. As a member of the six hero families, he had never heard of anyone receiving an invitation from a holy temple.</p>
<p>Even the first six heroes who came to the Holy Land had only been chosen after many trials.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had seen an invitation extended by the holy temple.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you waiting for? Quick, agree.” Li Xuan hurriedly nudged Zhou Wen when he saw him in a daze.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t feeling happy about being invited. The reason he was stunned was because after the wyrm sent out the invitation, his Life Providence, Sigh of the King, seemed to be in a frenzy. A sense of disgust spread through him, affecting him with those emotions.</p>
<h3 id='chapter206'>Chapter 206 Who’s the Real Scion?</h3>
<p>That feeling was intense, so intense that Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to reject it. “Sorry, I only accompanied my friend here to take a look. I don’t wish to obtain anything from the Connate Holy Temple.”</p>
<p>The wyrm shot Zhou Wen a look again before slowly retreating back to the stone pillar and slowly transforming into a lifeless statue.</p>
<p>Lance looked at Zhou Wen with piqued interest.</p>
<p>Li Xuan sighed and said, “Old Zhou, if you rejected it because of me, I will be touched and also sad.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it. Connate Infinite physique wasn’t my goal to begin with. Even without you, I would still reject it.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“That makes me even more depressed,” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and visit the other holy temples.” Zhou Wen only wanted to visit the other holy temples to take a look.</p>
<p>The Sigh of the King was a result of his own attributes and the Lost Immortal Sutra, but now that the Sigh of the King had ostracized the holy temple, it was likely difficult for Zhou Wen’s original advancement plan to succeed.</p>
<p>If I can’t use a special physique to raise my stats to 21 points, how can I advance to the Epic stage? Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>This fellow sure is interesting. Seeing Zhou Wen and Li Xuan leave, Lance turned and entered the Connate Holy Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan rushed to the Sun God Temple, not because of the Sun Strafe Art, but because it was closest to the Connate Holy Temple.</p>
<p>However, they did not know that the members of the six hero families were already gathered together, discussing how to deal with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Previously, when Liz had gone to the various families to seek their cooperation, most of the members of the six hero families thought nothing of it. They felt that there was no need for them to involve themselves in dealing with Zhou Wen since An Jing wasn’t coming.</p>
<p>However, who knew that John would have his Primordial Energy sea crippled by Zhou Wen despite leading more than ten people to teach him a lesson. Even the black-robed youth of the Xia family had been crippled.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen appeared to be another An Tianzuo, making many of the members of the six hero families find it unbearable.</p>
<p>“An Tianzuo has already humiliated our six families. Now, there’s another, Zhou Wen. Such a tendency cannot be encouraged. What do you think?” Xia Bing said coldly.</p>
<p>The black-robed youth that Zhou Wen had robbed of his Primordial Energy sea in front of the Connate Holy Temple, was Xia Bing’s younger brother.</p>
<p>“Originally, I couldn’t be bothered with him, but I never expected him to be so outrageous. We should really teach him a lesson. Otherwise, others will think that we are easily bullied. In the future, anyone will dare to bully us,” Dugu Chuan of the Dugu family added.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen has to be crippled. However, he has an abnormally powerful Companion Beast on him. It can transform into a fan that can even withstand my Light of Judgment. If we can’t deal with the fan, I’m afraid it will be difficult to subdue him,” John said weakly.</p>
<p>“A Companion Beast Primordial Energy Skill that even the Light of Judgment can’t withstand is something we have to be wary of. If only the Goddess of Wind’s Protection was here. That treasure is most resistant to wind-elemental powers,” said Xia Bing.</p>
<p>John said with a bitter smile, “I did bring the Goddess of Wind’s Protection, but Zhou Wen snatched it away. However, even with the Goddess of Wind’s Protection, it was useless. After all, that item can only protect one person. The others will still be injured by the fan’s strength.”</p>
<p>Xia Bing and company were taken aback when they heard that. They never expected John to spend that much. He had even brought the Goddess of Wind’s Protection. It was a pity that Zhou Wen had robbed it from him.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan pondered for a moment before saying, “Such a Primordial Energy Skill definitely expends a great deal of Primordial Energy. All we need to do is use a tag-team strategy and expend his Primordial Energy. That way, it will be useless even if he has the fan.”</p>
<p>John hurriedly shook his head and said, “This method won’t work. When we were fighting him previously, he used it six times during the battle. However, he still had plenty of Primordial Energy to use other Primordial Energy Skills. I believe he has some treasure that can rapidly recover his Primordial Energy.”</p>
<p>“In that case, it’s really a big problem.” Dugu Chuan frowned.</p>
<p>“It’s not much trouble. Leave that fan to me,” Xia Bing said.</p>
<p>“Xia Bing, are you confident? We can’t fail again. Otherwise, the six hero families will become laughing stocks,” Dugu Chuan said.</p>
<p>“It’s not convenient for me to elaborate on the details, but don’t worry. As long as I confirm that the fan is a manifestation of the wind-elemental Companion Beast, I have a hundred percent chance of making it useless.” Xia Bing was confident.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll leave the fan problem to you. Let’s find Zhou Wen now,” said Dugu Chuan as he stood up.</p>
<p>“Wait,” John called out to him.</p>
<p>“Is there anything else?” Dugu Chuan frowned.</p>
<p>John coughed lightly and said, “Besides possessing that fan, Zhou Wen is also very skilled in flight. Without using any flying Companion Beasts or mounts, he is able to move freely in the sky, almost like Superman. I wonder what Primordial Energy Skill he cultivates in or what kind of flying treasure he possesses. You have to be constantly on guard when you head over. Don’t let him use his flying abilities to escape.”</p>
<p>“Is it a wind-elemental flying skill?” Xia Bing asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. I didn’t sense the power of the wind on him.” John shook his head.</p>
<p>“This is a little troublesome. If it’s not a wind-elemental flying skill, I won’t be able to do anything to him,” Xia Bing said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Leave this problem to me. I promise I won’t let him escape,” said a blonde youth.</p>
<p>When Xia Bing and Dugu Chuan saw that the person who spoke was Pros, they all nodded slightly. They fully trusted his abilities and didn’t say anything else other than prepare to set off.</p>
<p>“Wait,” John called out to them again.</p>
<p>“What else is there?” Xia Bing was getting impatient.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen still has a saber. It’s extremely sharp. My Legendary Snake of Brilliance was easily chopped apart by it. Also, the flying mounts we used previously were also split into two with a single strike. You have to be careful,” John added.</p>
<p>“What else do you know? Say it all at once.” Dugu Chuan already had a headache.</p>
<p>A terrifying pet, a powerful flying skill, and an extremely sharp weapon. Any one of these items was enough to make an ordinary person world famous. Yet, Zhou Wen actually had all three at the same time. It was no wonder that even John had been defeated by him. It wasn’t simply because of his incompetence.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing else. By the way, Zhou Wen still has a Companion Beast. Its defensive strength is extremely high, making it difficult for ordinary Legendary weapons to injure it. There’s also a knight pet that has a powerful offensive and destructive power…” John added after some thought.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan, Xia Bing, and company looked at John as a thought arose in their minds. Who’s the real scion? Aren’t our six hero families the most powerful and rich families in the alliance? Why does it seem like Zhou Wen is richer than us?</p>
<h3 id='chapter207'>Chapter 207 Battle in Front of the Temple</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen and Li Xuan arrived at Sun God Temple, they were somewhat surprised to discover that there wasn’t a single person in front of it. Furthermore, the temple’s main door was open, proving that no one was undergoing a test.</p>
<p>“That’s odd. Is the Sun God Temple that unpopular? Why isn’t anyone here undergoing the test?” Li Xuan looked around in puzzlement. Indeed, there was no one.</p>
<p>“We came rather late after being caught up with matters. Perhaps the people who came here to take the test have already left.” Zhou Wen walked towards the Sun God Temple’s interior, intending to give it a try. He wanted to know if the Sun God Temple really ostracized the special physiques.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen entered the temple, the door automatically closed. Li Xuan sat on the stone steps outside and waited for him.</p>
<p>However, just as he sat down, he saw a group of people walk over. When Li Xuan took a glance, his expression changed drastically. His lackadaisical appearance instantly vanished as his expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>The people who approached were all members of the six hero families, so it was obviously not a coincidence that they were here together.</p>
<p>“You are Li Xuan from Luoyang’s Li family?” Nearly fifty people surrounded the temple as Xia Bing sized up Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I’m Li Xuan. Hello, Miss Xia.” Li Xuan bowed slightly at Xia Bing.</p>
<p>Li Xuan recognized Xia Bing. Among the six great hero families, the Xia family had its roots in the East District. It was the biggest and wealthiest family there. Even though the Li family was considered a wealthy family in Luoyang, it was nothing compared to the Xia family.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Li family and the Xia family had business dealings and had many connections. Even the Li family’s Invincible Connate Divine Art was obtained from the Xia family.</p>
<p>“Since you addressed me as Miss Xia, I’ll let you leave on account of your father and second brother. Don’t interact with people like Zhou Wen again. It won’t do you any good,” Xia Bing said as she walked towards the main door.</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, Zhou Wen is undergoing a test inside. You can’t enter now,” Li Xuan said with a smile, but he didn’t make way.</p>
<p>“We are precisely waiting for him to take the test. Does he really think he can obtain the Sun God Body? An Tianzuo failed to obtain it. It will be the same for him. Furthermore, he has to pay the price,” said Pros disdainfully.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Li Xuan’s smile deepened, but he realized that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan didn’t know what they had done, things were definitely not that simple. Logically speaking, outsiders wouldn’t be able to enter the temple during someone’s test, nor would they be able to disturb the people inside.</p>
<p>However, from the way Pros spoke, they clearly had a way of influencing Zhou Wen who was undergoing the trial. They might even be able to deal him some form of damage.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap and get out of my way.” Xia Bing was already impatient. She was infuriated that her brother had his Primordial Energy sea crippled by Zhou Wen. She couldn’t wait to personally destroy Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy sea.</p>
<p>“Miss Xia, what are you planning to do?” Li Xuan didn’t move as he continued to block her way.</p>
<p>Xia Bing frowned slightly as she stared at Li Xuan and said, “Li Xuan, do you have a death wish?”</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t get anything out of her, Li Xuan wiped away his smile and looked at Xia Bing. “Miss Xia, I really don’t wish to be enemies with you. However, the person undergoing the test is my friend. I haven’t had friends since I was young, and two of my friends died not long ago. It greatly upset me, so I really do not wish to see my friend get hurt. Can you tell me what you wish to do to Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“To have the courage to say such things, Luoyang’s Li family can be considered quite impressive. However, you have to understand your limits, or you might not be able to bear the consequences,” Xia Bing said.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap with him. I’ll finish him off first before destroying Zhou Wen’s trial.” Without Xia Bing’s patience, Pros threw a punch at Li Xuan. The fist flashed with terrifying lightning, bringing about horrifying beams of light.</p>
<p>Li Xuan raised his fist to receive the punch. When the fists collided, Li Xuan’s body immediately trembled, as though he had been electrocuted, before he was sent flying by Pros’s punch.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s body slammed into the Sun God Temple’s door and he immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. However, he stumbled to his feet and walked back to Pros with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“You are courting death.” With another punch, Pros’s lightning-like punch sent Li Xuan flying once again. It looked like Li Xuan was even more miserable than the last time.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan still stubbornly walked back. He looked like he was about to lose his footing, as though a gust of wind would topple him.</p>
<p>Pros frowned and said, “Li Xuan, do you really want to die here? Is it worth it for Zhou Wen?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see my friend get hurt again. Let him off, please?” Li Xuan muttered.</p>
<p>“Pros, don’t waste any more time. Just cripple him,” said Dugu Chuan.</p>
<p>With a nod, Pros punched Li Xuan again, but this time, he struck Li Xuan’s abdomen.</p>
<p>Typically, when a person cultivated in a Primordial Energy Art, they would need to store their Primordial Energy in one area. This area was the Primordial Energy sea, but the locations varied depending on the Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>Most of the Primordial Energy sea was in the lower dantian, which was where the abdomen was. If the Primordial Energy sea was crippled, Primordial Energy would leak, making it impossible to store any more Primordial Energy. It was equivalent to being crippled.</p>
<p>There were also some Primordial Energy Arts that had Primordial Energy seas not in the lower dantian, and that made it more difficult to find.</p>
<p>Pros didn’t know where Li Xuan’s Primordial Energy sea was, so he first attacked Li Xuan’s abdomen. If his Primordial Energy sea was there, such a terrifying lightning blast could penetrate his Primordial Energy, causing his Primordial Energy to leak and turn him into a cripple.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Li Xuan was sent flying once again. He looked even more miserable than before. He struggled to get up, but he staggered around, unable to even stand properly. Yet, he still attempted to get up and walk back.</p>
<p>Everyone was perturbed. There were not many people in this era who would be so foolish for their friends.</p>
<p>However, Xia Bing suddenly said with an odd expression, “Something’s not right. His body has a jade-like luster, and his eyes are faintly glowing. It’s a sign that he has mastered the Invincible Connate Divine Art. Such injuries are nothing to a Legendary who has cultivated the Invincible Connate Divine Art. Furthermore, his Primordial Energy sea isn’t in his lower dantian. It’s impossible for him to be in such a wretched state.”</p>
<p>Xia Bing’s words left everyone stunned. When Li Xuan heard Xia Bing’s words, his staggering body also straightened up. Wiping away the blood from his mouth, his entire bearing changed.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, I can’t hide it from you, Miss Xia.” Li Xuan sighed slightly. He originally wanted to stall for time, but unfortunately, with Xia Bing, who was familiar with the Invincible Connate Divine Art, there was no use no matter how superb his acting was.</p>
<p>When Pros saw that he had been fooled, he was immediately enraged. The lightning on his body flared as the bolts of lightning around his fist struck Li Xuan like a sun.</p>
<p>Li Xuan didn’t retreat; instead, he advanced. A heavy sword that was wrapped in lightning appeared in his hand. Lightning flashed on the sword as it headed straight for Pros’s fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Two types of lightning exploded in the sky, only to reveal Li Xuan standing proudly on the stone steps with his heavy sword in hand. As for Pros, he had taken a few steps back and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<h3 id='chapter208'>Chapter 208 Sun God Temple</h3>
<p>Everyone was astonished. Even among the six hero families, Pros was rather famous. It was truly shocking that he had been defeated by Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Thundergod General? The one he bought at the trading market actually had the Thundergod Augmentation skill. How lucky.” Immediately, someone recognized the Thundergod Sword in Li Xuan’s hand.</p>
<p>“He’s really lucky. He bought a Thundergod General with Thundergod Augmentation for only two million. This punk is really lucky,” someone said jealously.</p>
<p>Back at the trading market, Li Xuan’s spending of two million to buy a Thundergod Companion Egg had made him the target of mockery. It was a Companion Egg that could be bought for four to five hundred thousand outside; yet, he chose to spend two million here. It was an act of a fool.</p>
<p>However, when they saw Thundergod General with Thundergod Augmentation, many of them turned green with envy.</p>
<p>The Thundergod General was the best offensive pet among Legendaries. Even a fellow like Pros, who was adept at lightning-elemental forces, suffered quite a bit.</p>
<p>“So Pros, who claims to be the son of lightning, is nothing much after all. He can’t even defeat the lightning forces of a Companion Beast. How disappointing.” Li Xuan wanted to infuriate Pros and make him fight him alone. That way, he could delay things.</p>
<p>“Pros, he’s deliberately trying to provoke you to stall for time,” Xia Bing said.</p>
<p>Pros nodded slightly as lightning flickered in his golden pupils. He stared at Li Xuan and said, “You’ve successfully provoked me, so die.”</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t the only one who made a move. A few members of the six hero families attacked Li Xuan in a bid to finish him off in the fastest time possible before destroying Zhou Wen’s trial.</p>
<p>“I’ve been unknown for sixteen years. Today, I’m fighting the masses with one sword. I don’t seek a place in history, only an eternal name.” Li Xuan held the Thundergod Sword in hand and stood proudly in front of the Sun God Temple. This was the first time he had looked this serious.</p>
<p>The sword struck out like lightning, causing ripples to form as it surged towards the attacks of his assailants.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen walked into the temple, he originally thought of it as merely a palace, but after entering it, he realized that the inside of the temple was a void.</p>
<p>In this void, there was a sun hanging high above. It emitted an extremely resplendent divine light, as though it was the center of this empty universe.</p>
<p>At Zhou Wen’s feet were a stone staircase floating in the void, one that extended towards the sun.</p>
<p>“Path seeker, step on the stone steps and walk towards the sun. The closer you are to the sun, the more likely it is for you to obtain the God of the Sun’s power.” An ethereal voice sounded in the void.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense any abnormal reaction from the Sigh of the King as he walked towards the stone steps ahead. After taking a few steps, he felt the temperature around him increase significantly.</p>
<p>The temperature had risen quickly. After walking more than ten steps, Zhou Wen felt as though he had walked into a furnace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the chick on his shoulder looked like it was enjoying itself as if this heat made it very comfortable.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen entered the hall, he had switched the Primordial Energy Art to the Ancient Imperial Sutra. The Ancient Imperial Sutra also seemed to have a portion of the power of fire, but it was completely different from the power of the Sun God Temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that Ancient Imperial Sutra’s powers of a similar trait would allow him to take advantage of the situation, but now, he realized that that wasn’t the case. Despite using all his strength to resist the sun’s mighty splendor, he was already covered in sweat after taking about twenty steps. If he continued walking another ten steps, he might end up dehydrated by the sun.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Zhou Wen had no choice but to activate his Lotus Flower Buddha Body Primordial Energy Skill to resist the Sun God’s splendor. But even so, he only managed to take a few more steps; he was still a long way from the sun in the void.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, ordinary people can’t withstand the power of the Sun God Temple. Unless they cultivate in a corresponding Primordial Energy Art and receive the recognition of the temple; otherwise, even an Epic expert wouldn’t be able to walk to the front of the sun. Zhou Wen already had the intention to retreat.</p>
<p>He was only here to seek out a way to break through, not to risk his life. Since he knew that there was no possibility, there was no need to continue.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to retreat, the Ancient Imperial Sutra inside him automatically changed back into the Lost Immortal Sutra. The Lost Immortal Sutra slowly circulated as the originally ethereal Lost Immortal Sutra gradually turned warm.</p>
<p>As the Lost Immortal Sutra heated up his Primordial Energy, the Sun God’s splendor around Zhou Wen’s body no longer seemed to be as hot as before. Zhou Wen immediately felt energized.</p>
<p>The Lost Immortal Sutra has finally shown its effects. Could it be that there’s hope of advancing this time? Zhou Wen was delighted as he dispelled the thought of retreating and continued proceeding.</p>
<p>After the Lost Immortal Sutra showed its effects, the effects of the Sun God’s splendor on him grew less and less. When it shone on Zhou Wen, he found it comfortably warm. It wasn’t anything like the scorching heat from before.</p>
<p>If I were to cultivate in the Sun Strafe Art, the effect would probably be like this if I came to the Sun God Temple, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself as he walked towards the sun.</p>
<p>The sun that seemed to be far away also seemed to become much closer. With every step Zhou Wen took, he could sense that he was rapidly approaching the sun.</p>
<p>How is this a test? It’s clearly a selection. Those who are selected by the temple would be able to get close with a casual stroll, but those who aren’t selected will not be able to succeed no matter how hard they try. If not for the fact that the Lost Immortal Sutra is able to fool the terrifying existence here, even if I had advanced to the Epic stage, I wouldn’t have been able to reach the sun. Indeed, nothing in the world is fair. It’s the same for the miraculous Sun God Temple.</p>
<p>As he pondered, Zhou Wen was getting closer and closer to the sun. The sun was no longer as blinding as before, allowing him to see it clearly.</p>
<p>It turned out that it wasn’t a sun, but a golden seed. It looked like a pine nut, and its entire body was like a golden crystal.</p>
<p>The seed emitted light and heat, making it look like a sun.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the chick on his shoulder and was surprised to see it still looking relaxed. It didn’t seem to be affected by the sun’s temperature at all.</p>
<p>He had the Lost Immortal Sutra that played the role of confusing the Sun God Temple’s mechanism; therefore, he wasn’t suppressed by the power of the Sun God Temple. This was how he had managed to reach this point.</p>
<p>However, the chick didn’t have the Lost Immortal Sutra. The fact that it relied on its body to withstand the forces made it rather terrifying</p>
<p>I wonder what level this chick’s mother is. From its appearance, it’s unlikely that its mother is as simple as an Epic creature. Zhou Wen proceeded forward step by step, approaching the seed without suffering any effects.</p>
<p>Finally, when Zhou Wen was on the last stone step, the seed floated inches away from him. All he needed to do was stretch out his hand to obtain the sun-like seed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter209'>Chapter 209 The Sun Disc</h3>
<p>Outside, Li Xuan had his back against the temple’s door. He brandished the Thundergod Sword crazily, blocking one attack after another.</p>
<p>However, no matter how powerful he was, he couldn’t withstand all the attacks-sword beams, battle aura, flames, ice, and various powers tore through the flaws in his moves, tearing apart the armor he was wearing. Even his Three-Eyed Golden Warrior’s Golden Silk Soft Armor was damaged from the numerous attacks.</p>
<p>A terrifying sword beam directly tore through Li Xuan’s body of flesh and blood. The powerful battle aura made his bones produce cracking sounds, as all kinds of attacks left countless wounds on him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s injuries were now in more than a hundred spots. However, he still stood in front of the hall and continued brandishing the Thundergod Sword, as though he was a tireless war machine.</p>
<p>As for the injuries on his body, they healed at an unbelievable speed. Often, wounds that had just been formed would be healed a few seconds later. The wounds seemed to only flow through his body like water, disappearing from a mere flick.</p>
<p>Xia Bing and the others were appalled by the rapid recovery of his injuries.</p>
<p>Although the Invincible Connate Divine Art has powerful recovery abilities, he’s only at the Legendary stage. It can’t have such a powerful effect unless there’s something wrong with his Life Providence. Xia Bing had already guessed the reason, and she couldn’t help but feel envious and jealous.</p>
<p>The Invincible Connate Divine Art was the first Primordial Energy Art the Xia family had obtained. It also corresponded to the Connate Holy Temple. However, the Invincible Connate Divine Art needed a virgin male to cultivate it. Once he wasn’t a virgin, he would become a cripple and it would require cultivating all over again. Therefore, the Xia family would only give up the Invincible Connate Divine Art unwillingly.</p>
<p>Back then, one of the six heroes, a Xia family elder, had turned from an invincible hero to an ordinary person in order to get married and have children. In order to prevent such things from happening again, the Xia family’s elders had sought out several other Primordial Energy Arts to replace the Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>However, the Xia family had no intention of handing the Invincible Connate Divine Art over to someone else. The Li family had once helped the Xia family a great deal and suggested using the Invincible Connate Divine Art as an exchange. Although the Xia family had given it to them, it was only a simplified version. It was still far from the true Invincible Connate Divine Art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without the corresponding Connate Infinite Body, the power one was able to use with the Invincible Connate Divine Art was extremely limited.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan, who was only practicing a simplified version of the Invincible Connate Divine Art and didn’t even have a Connate Infinite Body, was able to condense a Life Providence that was in no way inferior to the Xia family’s hero. It was truly enviable.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s Life Providence was clearly different from that of the Xia family’s elders. Xia Bing only knew that of a powerful recovery ability, but she wasn’t too sure of its exact functions.</p>
<p>“This fellow is an unkillable monster. There’s no point in fighting any further. If we don’t quickly enter the Sun God Temple, I’m afraid Zhou Wen will be out soon. All the work we did previously would be for nothing,” said Dugu Chuan.</p>
<p>“I know that too, but what can I do?” Pros pummeled Li Xuan’s chest with his punches, causing it to cave slightly. But in a blink of an eye, his chest bulged once again, as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p>“I do have a Companion Beast that should be useful. Although it won’t kill him, it can control him. However, with this pet down, I’m afraid you’ll have to put in more effort when dealing with Zhou Wen later,” said Dugu Chuan hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you aware of the situation? Let’s get rid of this monster first. As long as we destroy Zhou Wen’s trial, he’ll be severely injured. Will it be difficult for us to cripple him when that happens?” Pros said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” After some thought, Dugu Chuan agreed that it made sense. Without any hesitation, he summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>It was a huge, snow-white spider with blood-colored patterns on its back. The patterns looked like a woman’s face.</p>
<p>In the next second, the spider transformed into a snow-white pole and landed in Dugu Chuan’s hands. Soon, he found an opportunity and struck Li Xuan with the snow-white pole.</p>
<p>The weapon, that looked like a pole, instantly transformed into a huge net that bound Li Xuan’s body. Dugu Chuan pulled the net with all his might, trying to pull Li Xuan away from the door.</p>
<p>Li Xuan tried using the Thundergod Sword to slice through the net, but it was stuck to the net. The more he struggled, the tighter the net became.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan was rather powerful. Dugu Chuan alone was unable to pull Li Xuan away.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you helping?” shouted Dugu Chuan. A few people beside him rushed over to help him pull the net and soon, Li Xuan’s figure was forcibly pulled out.</p>
<p>After Dugu Chuan pulled Li Xuan away, he said to the nearby Pros, “Pros, we’ll hold him back for now. Quickly take action. Don’t let Zhou Wen complete the trial.”</p>
<p>“Alright, leave it to me. Don’t worry.” Without the need for Dugu Chuan to mention it, Pros had already rushed to the door.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to stop him, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Pros carried an item in his arms—a sun disc. He searched the Sun God Temple’s main door for a while before he placed the sun disc into a groove on the door. The sun disc fitted perfectly with the door, as if they were born together.</p>
<p>The sun disc was left behind by an elder of the Pros family who was also one of the six heroes of the past. The physique he obtained was the Sun God Body.</p>
<p>The sun disc was also an item that the elder had taken out of the Sun God Temple. As the first-generation representative of the Sun God Temple, it gave him authority. If his descendants ever inherited the Sun God Body’s bloodline, then they could bring the sun disc back to the Sun God Temple and use the Sun God Body to activate the Sun God Body’s enhanced trial.</p>
<p>An enhanced trial was specially prepared for people with the Sun God Body, and its difficulty far exceeded that of ordinary trials. Even people with the Sun God Body might not necessarily pass this trial, much less ordinary people.</p>
<p>In the past, someone from the Pros family had attempted the enhanced trial at Sun God Temple with a Sun God Body, but in the end, not only was he unable to pass the trial, he was even seriously injured. He only fully recovered after three to four years of recuperation.</p>
<p>It was quite a coincidence. Xia Bing and Pros knew that the An family had the Sun Strafe Art which was most compatible with the Sun God Temple. They believed that Zhou Wen must have cultivated the Sun Strafe Art and would come to Sun God Temple to take the test. This was why they set up this trap.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t cultivate in the Sun Strafe Art, it was a coincidence that he came to Sun God Temple. It could only be said that Pros and company hit the mark by fluke.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was just about to reach out to pluck the sun-like seed when he suddenly saw the seed light brighten up, turning abnormally resplendent.</p>
<h3 id='chapter210'>Chapter 210 Getting the Seed</h3>
<p>As the seed’s temperature rose abnormally, the surrounding temperature also increased abruptly. Terrifying golden flames burned in the entire Sun God Temple, instantly filling the void.</p>
<p>The seed was like a piece of golden glass with golden symbols shimmering within.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen jumped in fright as his clothes ignited. He immediately knew that something was amiss. The Lost Immortal Sutra was only masquerading his physique after all. He didn’t really possess a Sun God Body, so if he was consumed by the flames, he would definitely be burnt to ashes.</p>
<p>With the golden flames about to engulf him, Zhou Wen was just about to use his summoned banana fan when a cold sensation emanated from his neck as the flames on his body automatically extinguished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he looked down and realized that the coolness had come from a pendant hanging around his neck. It was the ivory pendant Wang Mingyuan had given him before he left.</p>
<p>The pendant that Teacher gave me isn’t an ordinary item? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.</p>
<p>Without any time to think, Zhou Wen held the banana fan and attempted to rush out of Sun God Temple. As for the seed, even though he wanted to attempt taking it, he didn’t dare to do so. The temperature on it was terrifyingly high, so even metal would melt upon contact.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder opened its beak and inhaled. The golden flames surrounding Zhou Wen immediately gushed towards the chick’s mouth like a breach of a dam.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the golden flames that filled the sky surged like a heavenly river into the chick’s tiny mouth. Its tiny body seemed like a bottomless abyss. All the golden flames -no matter how many were there-were gone the moment they were sucked in.</p>
<p>As the golden flames were swallowed, the pale yellow feathers on the chick’s body began to show a luster. Its feathers looked fuller with a faint golden glow.</p>
<p>The more golden flames it absorbed, the more vibrant its feathers became. It even seemed to have grown bigger in size.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as the golden flames in the void were completely absorbed by the chick. The terrifying heat also vanished, leaving the seed glowing like a miniature sun.</p>
<p>At that moment, the chick’s body had grown to the size of a pigeon. Its feathers were pale gold and looked like a pigeon with a somewhat special color.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to you this time.” Zhou Wen patted the chick’s head and stowed away the banana fan.</p>
<p>Although the banana fan’s Grand Yin Wind could suppress the golden flames here, Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy was limited after all. With his Dao body’s recovery abilities, it was impossible for him to continuously use the Grand Yin Wind. He would have suffered no matter what.</p>
<p>With the flames extinguished, Zhou Wen looked at the golden seed and frowned slightly. The golden symbol in the seed was still coruscating, allowing him to sense the extreme temperatures of the seed.</p>
<p>He tried to grab it with his hand, but before his fingers could touch the seed, he felt as though he was scalded by the terrifying heat.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no way for him to obtain the seed, Zhou Wen had an idea. He took out his mysterious phone and aimed at the seed. Indeed, the camera had successfully locked onto the seed. With a snap, the seed immediately vanished and was stored into his phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed. He hurriedly put away his phone and turned to leave.</p>
<p>With the abrupt turn of events happening inside the Sun God Temple, Zhou Wen suspected that something had happened outside.</p>
<p>Outside Sun God Temple, Pros and company were waiting for Zhou Wen to come out. Although there were others who wished for him to die there, they knew that he wouldn’t die so easily. However, it was likely that he would be severely injured.</p>
<p>Facing a heavily injured Zhou Wen would most likely be a lot easier for them.</p>
<p>If John hadn’t described Zhou Wen as he had, they wouldn’t have come up with such a plan. If this were any other time, they would have directly approached Zhou Wen and suppressed him with force.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Finally, the door to the Sun God Temple opened. All of them hurriedly prepared their respective Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skills. They planned on taking Zhou Wen down when he rushed out.</p>
<p>However, when they saw the situation inside the Sun God Temple’s main door, they were stunned.</p>
<p>At the moment the divine palace opened, the carvings and patterns on it began to emit a holy glow. The stone palace that looked ancient was now resplendent in divine light, as though it was a palace found in myths.</p>
<p>The portrait of the sun at the highest point of the palace emitted unparalleled light, as though it was announcing something to the world.</p>
<p>“Why would there be a phenomenon at the Sun God Temple now? Isn’t this a phenomenon that will only happen after ten days? We are still days away before the trial ends. Why is it now…” The more Pros spoke, the softer his voice became and the nastier his expression became.</p>
<p>He had already understood the only reason for such a situation to take place—someone had already walked up to the sun seed and taken it away.</p>
<p>However, the result of his guess was something that even Pros found unbelievable.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that using the sun disc could enhance the difficulty of the trial, few people could walk to the sun seed and take it away in an ordinary Sun God Temple trial.</p>
<p>Even in their families, only two people had done so after all these years. One of them was a first-generation hero, and the other was a person who had inherited the Sun God Body bloodline. The latter had obtained the sun seed by undergoing the ordinary trial.</p>
<p>As for the enhanced trial, even if one had the Sun God Body, no one had ever obtained the sun seed. Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have the Sun God Body. Pros refused to believe that Zhou Wen was able to obtain it in the enhanced trial.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much he refused to believe it, the truth was already in front of him. Zhou Wen had walked out unharmed; even the pigeon on his shoulder was unharmed.</p>
<p>“Pros, what’s going on? Didn’t you say that no one can pass the enhanced trial? That without the Sun God Body, it’s unknown if one can even survive??” Seeing Zhou Wen unscathed, Dugu Chuan couldn’t help but question him.</p>
<p>“How would I know!” Pros was also furious. He too wanted to know what was going on. This was completely different from what he imagined</p>
<p>“Now’s not the time to talk about this. Let’s take down Zhou Wen first and act according to plan. Even if he wasn’t injured in the temple, we can still cripple him,” Xia Bing said as she drew her sword and attacked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“You guys sure don’t know when to quit.” Zhou Wen turned his gaze and saw Li Xuan bound in a white net like a fish. He immediately relaxed when he realized that he wasn’t in a terrible state.</p>
<p>With Xia Bing and the others surrounding him, Zhou Wen held the banana fan and fanned them, sweeping out the Grand Yin Wind.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, Xia Bing held a calabash in her hand as she directed it at the Grand Yin Wind and sucked it in. The strong wind was sucked into the calabash, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter211'>Chapter 211 Sun God Power Crystal</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. As for Dugu Chuan and the others, they were overjoyed. They increased the forces in their hands as all colors of light beams shot towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Pros was already prepared, ready to cast the Myriad Thunder Sky Dungeon at any time to prevent Zhou Wen from escaping through the sky.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan summoned a strange shield to block Zhou Wen’s sharp Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>Xia Bing also summoned three Companion Beasts, preparing to restrain Zhou Wen’s Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and Mutated Demonized General.</p>
<p>The others also showcased their full range of abilities, hoping to take down Zhou Wen on the spot, leaving him no room to resist.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen could draw his saber, the chick on his shoulder suddenly spat out resplendent light from its mouth. Golden flames spewed out like a flood, instantly turning the square outside Sun God Temple into an inferno.</p>
<p>Immediately, tragic screams sounded out as everyone was left dumbfounded. They had prepared meticulously for this for so long, having thought of several strategies to use against him. Yet, before those strategies could be used, all of them were burnt to a crisp by the chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>At once, there were endless cries of agony. Many people were screaming as they rolled on the ground, trying to extinguish the flames on them. Some even took off their clothes while running.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen drew his saber and charged in. Without throwing any caution to the wind, he mercilessly stabbed their dantians.</p>
<p>Most people had their Primordial Energy sea in their dantians. So with Zhou Wen’s stab, they were practically crippled.</p>
<p>The few who didn’t have Primordial Energy seas at their dantian weren’t any better when they were impaled by Zhou Wen in their abdomens. They writhed on the ground, screaming endlessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tried finding Xia Bing in the chaos, but she was nowhere to be seen. Even Dugu Chuan had disappeared. As for Pros, he had attempted to escape amidst the chaos but was still slashed at by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Pros, feeling alarmed and furious, summoned his Companion Beast to block Zhou Wen. He still had full intention of escaping, having no illusions that he could put up a fight.</p>
<p>The chick’s flames had frightened him out of his wits. There were many Legendary Companion Beasts that could spew fire, but to be able to instantly turn an entire square into a sea of flames was something that he had never seen before.</p>
<p>What was even scarier was that those golden flames were clearly not ordinary flames. They could even burn through defensive battle auras. It was appalling.</p>
<p>However, Pros wasn’t as fast as Zhou Wen no matter how fast he fled. Zhou Wen split his Companion Beast into two and slashed his saber at him.</p>
<p>In this perilous situation, Pros turned around and summoned a gigantic ax to meet Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade. However, the gigantic ax was cleaved apart upon contact.</p>
<p>In his shock, he didn’t dare fight anymore and retreated as fast as he could.</p>
<p>With a flash, Zhou Wen pierced through Pros’s dantian, causing him to fall to the ground in pain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen withdrew his saber but didn’t look at him. He brandished his saber and stormed through the crowd. Bamboo Blade sliced through everything it met, be they Primordial Gold weapons or Companion Beast weapons. It was terrifyingly sharp.</p>
<p>To have a single person chase after dozens of people, with the pursuees being members of the six hero family would probably deal a shock to the League if they saw this scene</p>
<p>Fortunately, other than the members of the six families, there were only a few descendants of powerful figures from all over the world. Not many were there to watch.</p>
<p>There was only one spot for all the big shots in the world, unlike the juniors of the six hero families. As long as they were young and strong enough, they could enter the Holy Land.</p>
<p>After they entered, they headed straight for the Holy Land that they had set their sights on. No one wasted time wandering around.</p>
<p>Originally, Xia Bing and company believed that other than Zhou Wen, it was unlikely that descendants of other big shots would choose the Sun God Temple. Therefore, it was unlikely for anyone to see this.</p>
<p>However, to their dismay, this scene was witnessed by someone who had even recorded it.</p>
<p>The incident of An Tianzuo crippling the six hero families has been repeated. That guy is so strong, the person praised as he recorded.</p>
<p>However, he was rather careful. He only hid in the shadows and didn’t expose himself while recording, afraid that the six families would discover him.</p>
<p>By the time the battle ended, the people on the square were all lying on the ground, clutching their abdomens and screaming.</p>
<p>The spider web which bound Li Xuan had been burnt through by the golden flames, protecting him as a result. After escaping, Li Xuan joined the battle without any hesitation. However, he wasn’t beating people, but plundering those who collapsed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel regretful that he hadn’t found Xia Bing. He wanted to know what the calabash in her hand was.</p>
<p>After plundering the area with Li Xuan, the two of them left, leaving behind the children from the six family clans screaming in pain.</p>
<p>When they arrived in an uninhabited cave, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan sat down to divide the loot. After all, they didn’t know what breed the Companion Eggs were. Each person got half the pile, allowing Zhou Wen to obtain twenty-six Companion Eggs. They definitely wouldn’t be cheap considering who had purchased them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen planned on finding a time to use his mysterious phone to check the attributes of the Companion Eggs before choosing to hatch or fuse them.</p>
<p>The worst ones were, of course, a present for the Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was making his plans, the chick flew down from his shoulder and pecked at a Companion Egg. It lowered its head and sucked all the essence in it.</p>
<p>Since the chick had just helped tremendously, eating two Companion Eggs wasn’t a big deal. In a rare instance, Zhou Wen generously gave it another Companion Egg. But to his surprise, it didn’t show any appreciation. It didn’t even look at it as though it was completely uninterested.</p>
<p>“You’re rather picky with food. Even the better if you aren’t eating it.” Zhou Wen put away the Companion Eggs and ignored the chick.</p>
<p>Compared to a Companion Egg, he was more interested in the sun seed. He wanted to know what it was.</p>
<p>Previously, he had been in a hurry to come out and had taken in the sun seed into his mysterious phone, so he hadn’t had a chance to look at it again. He took out his cell phone to take a look and, seeing that the sun seed was still in the blood-colored avatar’s hand, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Using his phone to check the sun seed’s attributes, he was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Sun God Power Crystal: A product of the Sun God’s blood essence. Absorbing it will improve one’s body.</p>
<p>A choice to absorb or not appeared on the game screen. Zhou Wen didn’t sense any rejection from the Sigh of the King, so he chose to absorb it.</p>
<p>The Sun God Power Crystal immediately transformed into a golden beam that fused into the blood-colored avatar’s body. This made Zhou Wen also feel a burning sensation surge into his body, causing his body to heat up.</p>
<p>When everything returned to normal, Zhou Wen saw that the blood-colored avatar’s Strength stat had already changed to 21. And behind 21, there was also the word (Sun).</p>
<p>What does that mean? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<h3 id='chapter212'>Chapter 212 Trajectory Holy Temple</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted using his Strength, but he didn’t sense any additional attributes or burning effects. He didn’t know what the word “Sun” behind Strength meant.</p>
<p>However, he had finally found a way to make a breakthrough. Zhou Wen planned on visiting the other temples. If he could succeed in obtaining Power Crystals there, he might be able to advance to the Epic stage. When that happened, learning the Mutated Fairy Skill would be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Among the six holy temples, Zhou Wen had already been to two—the Connate and Sun God Holy Temples. The nearest one to them was the Divine Emperor Holy Temple.</p>
<p>However, after some consideration, Zhou Wen didn’t head to the Divine Emperor Holy Temple. Instead, he headed for one that was slightly further away.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen John’s Holy Emperor body before and guessed that it was likely a Strength-type physique. The Sun God Holy Temple had boosted his Strength, and the two seemed to overlap.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen planned on taking a look at the Trajectory Holy Temple first. It was said that it gave one the physique-Body of Trajectory; it was the most mysterious physique among the six.</p>
<p>The Dugu family, which had the Body of Trajectory, didn’t seem to offer any outstanding performance. Hence, this physique was the most controversial. Some people even claimed that the owner of the Body of Trajectory, the first-generation hero of the Dugu family, didn’t deserve to be ranked alongside the other five heroes.</p>
<p>However, the Dugu family’s lineage had continued most stably amongst the six families to date. In contrast, the other five families were more famous and had more power.</p>
<p>However, they would occasionally have people die for various reasons. However, up till now, no one from the Dugu line died.</p>
<p>The other first-generation heroes of the five families were mostly dead, but the original hero of the Dugu family remained alive and well. Now, the power of the Dugu family was so great that it was ranked in the top three of the six families.</p>
<p>Quite a number of people jested in private that having superior martial arts wasn’t as good as having a long life. The Dugu family’s hero had outlasted several young heroes of the other five families. In the future, perhaps once the members of the five families were all dead, the Dugu family would be able to rule the world.</p>
<p>The name—Trajectory-together with the fact that the people from the Dugu family had long lifespans, made Zhou Wen suspect that the Body of Trajectory was a Speed-type physique. Therefore, members of the Dugu family could escape quickly. This allowed them to survive several dangers and stay alive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was extremely interested in opportunities to augment his escaping abilities, so he planned on heading to the Trajectory Holy Temple to take a look.</p>
<p>Many of the people from the six families had been crippled by Zhou Wen, so the few remaining ones didn’t dare cause him trouble. It was as though they had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan spent more than a day walking in the Holy Land without meeting a single member of the six families. Instead, they encountered the descendants of several powerful figures from other places.</p>
<p>Those people had indifferent attitudes towards Zhou Wen. They neither offended him nor showed any intention of getting cozy with him. Clearly, they didn’t wish to interfere in the feud between Zhou Wen and the six families.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Trajectory Holy Temple, there was no one outside, but the door was closed. Clearly, someone was undergoing a test inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan could only wait outside. Zhou Wen took out his cell phone and continued gaming while Li Xuan studied them, having the intention of hatching them all.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, they suddenly heard a rumble. The door to Trajectory Holy Temple opened and a person rushed out.</p>
<p>The person really sped out and ran very quickly. Furthermore, his hair was disheveled and he looked like a lunatic. His face was awash with extreme horror as though he had seen something unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill me… Don’t kill me… I didn’t see anything… I didn’t see anything…”</p>
<p>“Pal, what’s wrong?” Li Xuan went forward to stop the person and pressed his shoulder as he asked.</p>
<p>Li Xuan wanted to ask what exactly was going on in the Trajectory Holy Temple to scare him to such an extent.</p>
<p>However, the moment Li Xuan pressed down on the man’s shoulder, the man immediately turned pale from fright. What happened next shocked Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>The person reached out and stabbed his eyes until they were two bloody holes. Then, he struggled to free himself from Li Xuan’s grasp. As he ran, he shouted, “I didn’t see anything… Don’t kill me… Don’t kill me…”</p>
<p>The duo was stunned as they looked at the bloodstains on the ground, wondering if they were dreaming.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, I think it’s best if we don’t enter this Holy Temple. Although we aren’t afraid of death, if we become a lunatic like that fellow, it’ll be a fate worse than death.” Li Xuan gulped his saliva and turned to look at the Trajectory Holy Temple. The way he looked at it was as though it was a diabolical den.</p>
<p>“Indeed.” Zhou Wen felt that what Li Xuan said made sense. He didn’t wish to become a lunatic, and he was indeed afraid of death.</p>
<p>The Holy Land appeared extremely safe without any dimensional creatures threatening their lives; however, the real danger was within the temples.</p>
<p>Previously, the Sun God Holy Temple had nearly injured Zhou Wen. With the Trajectory Holy Temple being so bizarre, Zhou Wen felt that he didn’t necessarily have to enter.</p>
<p>The two of them had a short discussion before preparing to leave. But at that moment, they saw the crazy man who had just stabbed his eyes run back again.</p>
<p>His eyes were still bleeding and he looked extremely terrifying. As he ran, he shouted, “Help… Help…”</p>
<p>His eyes were blinded, so he stumbled as he ran. It took him a few stumbles before coming in front of the duo. He fell to the ground and hugged Li Xuan’s thigh. “Save me… I don’t want to die… Save me…”</p>
<p>Li Xuan could sense that his body was trembling terribly, as though something extremely terrifying had affected his thoughts, causing such intense convulsions.</p>
<p>“What happened? Tell me clearly first.” Li Xuan felt apologetic towards the person, so he didn’t push him away and comforted him.</p>
<p>Li Xuan thought that if he hadn’t stopped this person just now, this person might not have blinded his eyes.</p>
<p>Even a lunatic would be happier to see things than being blind.</p>
<p>The person hugged Li Xuan’s calf and said in an extremely terrified tone, “I saw a ship-a very, very large ship. Someone on the ship was engaging in murder. All of them died… All of them died… I didn’t see anything… Don’t kill me… Don’t kill me…”</p>
<p>The person said a few more words before his madness worsened. He released Li Xuan’s leg and attempted to escape again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen extended his hand to pull the person. Since he was blind, there was a chance of him running off a cliff to certain death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen grabbed the man’s arm, but the man struggled with all his might. He managed to escape with his extraordinary strength, but his sleeve was ripped off by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>When his gaze landed on the man’s arm, Zhou Wen’s pupils constricted. On the man’s arm, there was an anchor-like tattoo.</p>
<h3 id='chapter213'>Chapter 213 Lunatic</h3>
<p>This was not the first time Zhou Wen had seen an image of the anchor. This was because women were typically taboo to sailors out at sea. Therefore, it was impossible for women to be engraved on an anchor, but this anchor symbol had a woman’s side profile on it. This left a deep impression on him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hadn’t figured out what the anchor symbol meant, so he was rather curious. Now, suddenly seeing such a tattoo on the person’s arm, he really wanted to ask him about the origins of it.</p>
<p>Alas, this person was another lunatic. He was running around like a madman. Despite being blind, he kept running. He stumbled and fell several times but refused to stop.</p>
<p>He mentioned that he had seen a ship, and that someone was engaging in murder on it. Does that anchor symbol have any relationship to the ship he mentioned? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Looking at the ancient Trajectory Holy Temple in the distance, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that his previous guess was wrong.</p>
<p>Most of the six original heroes died in the dimensional zones. Only the old hero of the Dugu family remained well and alive. Perhaps it was not because he had run the fastest.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, he must have seen something terrifying in the Trajectory Holy Temple. Typically, there are two possibilities. One is that there’s really something terrifying inside which is why he is so afraid. Another possibility is that there aren’t any terrifying things inside. All he saw was an illusion. Either way, this doesn’t look like a test of Speed-type physique. As Zhou Wen was in thought, the person had slammed himself into a tree due to his blindness. He fainted as a result.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked to the madman and checked his injuries. He realized that he had only suffered superficial wounds and there weren’t any serious problems. He had only fainted.</p>
<p>“Do you know who he is?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Those who were able to enter the Holy Land were either descendants of the six heroes or the representatives of powerful figures. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know him, a knowledgeable person like Li Xuan might.</p>
<p>If he could figure out the identity of this lunatic, he might be able to figure out something about him.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know him. However, judging from his attire, he doesn’t look like someone from the six families. He might be here to represent some big shot.”</p>
<p>With Li Xuan not being able to recognize him, Zhou Wen was out of ideas as he said to Li Xuan, “Is there any way to take him out? He’s a lunatic and now he’s blind. If we leave him here, he might not be able to survive.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid there’s no other way now. It’s easy to enter the Holy Land, but to leave, the six temples need to make a decision regarding their successors before a path will be opened. Now, no one can leave,” Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the intention of taking him out and asking about his background, but if he had to wait that long, it wouldn’t be convenient to take a lunatic along the way.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this. Tie him on my mount and we can bring him with us. After all, I caused him to become blind. It’s not good to leave him here,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen happened to share the same thoughts, so he immediately agreed.</p>
<p>After Li Xuan summoned a pet cow, the duo lifted the madman onto the cow’s back and used a rope to secure him on it before continuing on their journey to the other temples.</p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, they heard the crazy man on the cow’s back speaking. The two of them thought that he had woken up, but when they took a closer look, they saw him lying there and muttering to himself as if he was deliriously talking in a dream.</p>
<p>“Trajectory Holy Temple… I must go to the Trajectory Holy Temple… As long as I enter the Trajectory Holy Temple, I’ll know what exactly happened on the ship… Why are they killing each other… Why… Don’t… Don’t kill me… Don’t kill me… I didn’t see anything…” He mumbled incoherently in his dreams. Everything was fine at first, but it developed into a nightmare-like wail.</p>
<p>After listening for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly had the urge to enter the Trajectory Holy Temple to take a look.</p>
<p>Although this lunatic was somewhat incoherent, from what he had said, it was very possible that he had indeed been on a ship before. However, something unexpected had happened on the ship in the end. The people on the ship had been killing each other or killing someone. And this person had survived.</p>
<p>However, even the person in question didn’t know what had happened on the ship back then, so he wanted to use the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple to find out.</p>
<p>If this theory was valid, then the power in the Trajectory Holy Temple’s trajectory was very likely to allow people to see the past. That was why this person wanted to use its power.</p>
<p>In other words, it shouldn’t be because the power in the Trajectory Holy Temple had driven him mad. It was the happenings on the ship that he had seen that left him so frightened.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the man seemed to wake up from his nightmare. He immediately straightened his body, but he couldn’t sit up after being tied down. He could only stick to the cow’s back as his body stiffened like a stick.</p>
<p>“Who are you? What are you trying to do?” the lunatic shouted in horror.</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t be afraid. We don’t have any ill intentions. We were afraid that you would go crazy and run around, so we tied you up on the cow’s back. When the exit is opened, we will take you out of the Holy Land. The treatment techniques these days are excellent, and with the usable powers of a Companion Beast, you can definitely have your eyes healed.” Li Xuan didn’t care if he could understand and spoke quickly.</p>
<p>That person seemed to sober up a little. He wasn’t as afraid as before, but he was still a little agitated. He shouted, “I don’t want to leave! Let go of me! I want to enter the Trajectory Holy Temple…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks and could see the shock in each other’s eyes. This person had been so afraid moments ago that he was about to commit suicide, but now, he was insisting on returning to the Trajectory Holy Temple. It was truly baffling what he was up to.</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t be agitated. You just came out from the Trajectory Holy Temple. Why do you want to enter now?” Li Xuan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I want… I want…” The madman thought for a long period of time but couldn’t come up with a reason. Then, he suddenly froze and said in a daze, “What do I want? What do I want?”</p>
<p>“This person is really crazy.” Li Xuan shook his head with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the lunatic with a frown without saying a word. He really was curious about the madman’s affairs, but from the looks of it, he was unlikely to fathom anything out. This fellow’s brain was completely damaged.</p>
<p>The madman suddenly used all his strength to break the rope. He jumped off the cow’s back and ran in the direction of the Trajectory Holy Temple. His speed was so surprisingly fast that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t react in time.</p>
<h3 id='chapter214'>Chapter 214 Unable to Tell the Truth</h3>
<p>Xia Bing, Dugu Chuan, and the others were gathered together, their expressions not looking very good.</p>
<p>More than thirty people from the six families that had entered the Holy Land had been crippled by Zhou Wen. This was only thanks to some people’s Primordial Energy sea not being located at the lower dantian; otherwise, there would have been even more.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen is another An Tianzuo. If we were to let him leave the Holy Land, the reputation of our six families will be destroyed.” John’s face was pale, but he was flushed red from agitation.</p>
<p>“So what if you don’t let him leave? Which one of you has the means to restrain his Companion Beast?” Xia Bing said coldly.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of that kind of flame, but I’m no match for Zhou Wen alone. This fellow’s Companion Beast is just too powerful. The An family has been in charge of the Primordial Gold mine for so many years that they are filthy rich. In terms of wealth, they aren’t much inferior to our six families put together. From the looks of it, they went all out this time to smack us in the face,” Dugu Chuan said with a sigh. He imagined that Zhou Wen was a result of the An family’s arrangements.</p>
<p>“If I had known this would happen, I would have made more preparations. In terms of Companion Beasts, our family won’t lose to them in terms of quantity. It’s not impossible for us to incubate a few Epic Companion Beasts. At most, we would have to pay a tiny price.” Pros was feeling both angry and hateful.</p>
<p>His Primordial Energy sea was not in his lower dantian, so he wasn’t crippled. However, he didn’t feel good after being stabbed in his abdomen.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of all this hindsight? If I had known, I would’ve cried like a woman and thrown a tantrum. I would’ve taken the Mythical Companion Egg from my aunt and wouldn’t have allowed Zhou Wen to be so arrogant,” said Dugu Chuan gloomily.</p>
<p>Many of the six families’ members had special physiques, ones that allowed them to explore certain special dimensional zones. If they had a certain affinity, they would be able to obtain a Mythical Companion Egg like Zhou Wen in Small Buddha Temple.</p>
<p>A few of them had previously obtained Mythical Companion Eggs. However, they were only at the Mortal stage when they hatched. They needed to be fed for growth. As for whether they could advance to the Mythical stage, it was still an unknown.</p>
<p>After all these years, it was rare for one to actually raise a Companion Egg to the Mythical stage. It was rare even in the six families.</p>
<p>Ever since Dugu Chuan inherited his family’s Body of Trajectory, he had a chance to incubate a Mythical pet. However, it wasn’t safe enough. Therefore, Dugu Chuan’s aunt hadn’t given him the Mythical egg she had single-handedly obtained in the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Pros glanced at Xia Bing and said, “You have foresight. That calabash should be a Mythical Companion Beast, right?”</p>
<p>“Now isn’t the time to talk about this. Let’s think about how to deal with Zhou Wen first,” Xia Bing said indifferently without answering the question.</p>
<p>“What else is there? We don’t have any powerful Companion Beasts that can fight Zhou Wen. It’s useless no matter what ideas we come up with. In this Holy Land, only one person from our six families can defeat Zhou Wen,” John said.</p>
<p>“You mean Lance?” Xia Bing frowned.</p>
<p>“He’s the only one.” John nodded.</p>
<p>“But didn’t you say earlier that Lance has already rejected the request? With his personality, he won’t do a thing,” Xia Bing said.</p>
<p>“Now, things are different. People from his family have also been crippled by Zhou Wen. Even if Lance doesn’t help us, is he going to ignore kinship?” John asked.</p>
<p>Xia Bing and the others looked at each other, realizing that what John said made sense.</p>
<p>“Although what you said is true, you know Lance’s personality too. He’s very strange and it’s not necessarily possible. Let’s go find Lance first.” As Dugu Chuan spoke, he prepared to get up.</p>
<p>“Hold on. Tell Lance that Zhou Wen has two Mythical pets after you find him,” John suddenly said.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan and company were slightly taken aback. Although Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were powerful, they didn’t think in the direction of the Mythical Beast. They only believed that Zhou Wen had used some special method to hatch an Epic Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of special physiques, it was impossible for him to obtain a Mythical Companion Egg, much less incubate it. Zhou Wen didn’t have the bloodline of the six families, so it was impossible for him to have inherited a special physique. How could he have a Mythical Beast?</p>
<p>Therefore, they believed that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts only had high levels and powerful techniques.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen’s bird and fan are Mythical Companion Beasts?” asked Dugu Chuan as he stared at John.</p>
<p>“Is it really that important? As long as it intrigues Lance, no?” John said with a smile.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan immediately understood and nodded slightly. “Alright then. Those two pets indeed have extraordinary qualities and look like mythical pets.”</p>
<p>When Dugu Chuan took his guys to look for Lance, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were sitting in front of the Trajectory Holy Temple’s entrance, waiting.</p>
<p>That blind madman had actually charged into the Trajectory Holy Temple again. They wanted to wait for the lunatic to come out before reassessing the situation.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, do you think that lunatic’s words are reliable? If it’s really as he said, wouldn’t the power inside the Trajectory Holy Temple be something that can’t be seen?” Li Xuan said casually as he was bored.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You’ll need to enter to know.” Zhou Wen stared at the temple’s door. He was already tempted, but he didn’t want to take the risk.</p>
<p>Earlier on, he had searched the surroundings of the Trajectory Holy Temple, but he hadn’t found any sign of the tiny palm, preventing him from downloading this place into his phone.</p>
<p>Strange, why don’t the dimensional zones in the Holy Land have tiny palm symbols? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. If he could download them onto his cell phone, he could enter all the Holy Land without any scruples.</p>
<p>“If I must say, he’s a lunatic. He’s definitely spouting nonsense. Think about it. Although the League controls the entire Earth in name, it doesn’t dare head into the sea, nor do they dare go out to sea. That lunatic is only the same age as us. He’s definitely still a student. How can he head out to sea on a ship at such a young age? Therefore, what he said must be illusions he saw in the Trajectory Holy Temple,” Li theorized.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s words reminded Zhou Wen that going on a cruise was probably something that had happened before the dimensional storms came. After the dimensional storms, even an aircraft carrier wouldn’t return once it set off, much less an ordinary cruise ship.</p>
<p>It was impossible for an ordinary person to board a ship to head out into the sea. Just like them, this lunatic was a young man who was participating in the trials. At his age, even if his elders had the ability to go out to sea, they wouldn’t dare take him along.</p>
<p>Could it be that the power in the Trajectory Holy Temple is just an illusion? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>The anchor symbol on the lunatic’s arm still bothered him. Moreover, that lunatic had also said that he wanted to use the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple to see what had happened in the past.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’ll only know if that lunatic’s words are true after I enter the Trajectory Holy Temple and take a look. As Zhou Wen pondered, the temple’s door slowly opened.</p>
<p>The madman was lying in front of the door with one hand on the sill, motionless. They couldn’t tell if he was dead or unconscious.</p>
<h3 id='chapter215'>Chapter 215 Crossroads</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan hurriedly went over and pulled the lunatic’s hand out of the door.</p>
<p>When they went over, both of them had been very careful and hadn’t crossed the threshold. As long as they didn’t cross it, it wouldn’t be considered as entering the temple for a trial.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen grabbed the madman’s hand, he felt a strange force from inside the Trajectory Holy Temple pull him in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately sensed that something was amiss. He and Li Xuan had clearly held onto the madman’s hand at the same time without crossing the threshold. Why was Li Xuan fine, but he had been pulled into the door by some force?</p>
<p>Li Xuan reached out his hand to grab Zhou Wen, but it was too late. Zhou Wen was sucked inside and with a bang, the door to the temple automatically closed and left Li Xuan outside.</p>
<p>Seeing that he and the lunatic were locked inside, Zhou Wen pulled the lunatic away in a bid to head back. Typically, even if the trial had begun, he could still choose to withdraw.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen turned around, he was dumbfounded. There was no stone door behind him. Not only so, was nothing there, but there was only a straight road leading far into the distance. At the end of the road were blue skies and white clouds.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned his body 360 degrees and immediately realized that he and the lunatic were standing at a crossroads. All four directions led straight to the horizon. Apart from the road, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Neither the holy temple or stone walls existed.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? Is the test to get us to choose a path? But the four directions are the same. How do we choose? You need to give us some hints, right?” Zhou Wen shouted into the sky.</p>
<p>There had to be some creature in the temple controlling everything; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been pulled in. However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear any response after waiting for quite a while.</p>
<p>At that moment, the unconscious lunatic woke up. He rubbed his head and sat up, then sized up his surroundings. His face was filled with confusion.</p>
<p>The lunatic didn’t look as crazy as before while he asked, “What is this place?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you entered the Trajectory Holy Temple twice?” Zhou Wen gave him an odd expression. He had clearly been blinded, but he was now completely fine.</p>
<p>“This is the Trajectory Holy Temple? Isn’t there a ship in the Trajectory Holy Temple?” The madman looked at Zhou Wen in surprise as though he was trying to determine if what Zhou Wen said was true.</p>
<p>“You saw a ship when you entered the Trajectory Holy Temple before?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. If that ship was really an illusion that only the lunatic could see, it would be very difficult for him to get anything out of the lunatic’s mouth.</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s a ship.” When he mentioned it, the expression on his face changed again, but fortunately, he didn’t act up like before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly changed the topic and pointed at the anchor tattoo on his arm. “This tattoo of yours is rather interesting. Is there any special meaning to it?”</p>
<p>The madman seemed to be lost as he subconsciously answered, “This was tattooed by my father when I was young. He was a sailor and he said that this was the mark of their ship. When I grow up, I can become a sailor like him and work on his ship.”</p>
<p>“Are there still sailor professions these days?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement. From what he knew, no ship had dared to enter the sea in the past few decades. Even if someone were to enter, they would still be Epic experts steering a Companion Beast. A ship wouldn’t be required, much less a sailor.</p>
<p>“Yes, why not? Our hometown has many fishing boats that go out to sea every day to fish. It’s just that my dad’s ship is different. It’s a ship that travels across many countries and sells different goods to different countries.” The lunatic looked much more awake.</p>
<p>“Wait, you mentioned countries?” Zhou Wen stared at the madman with an odd expression, trying to determine if he was being fooled.</p>
<p>Countries were a concept before the dimensional storms. After the dimensional storms, there was only the League and no countries. Humans had united together to survive that calamity.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Is there something wrong?” The madman looked at Zhou Wen in astonishment as though whatever he said could only be right.</p>
<p>“Brother, how old are you?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Seventeen, why are you asking this?” the madman asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“Then are you joking with me? After the dimensional storms, how can there be any countries? There are dimensional zones everywhere over the sea. No one in the League dares to enter the sea now, much less fish. It would be pretty good if they weren’t eaten by fish,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? What League? What dimensional storm?” The madman looked at Zhou Wen like he was looking at a lunatic.</p>
<p>“Alright, don’t tell me that you were born before the dimensional storms.” Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the lunatic. He felt that this person was messing with him. Perhaps he hadn’t gone mad from the beginning</p>
<p>The madman looked at Zhou Wen seriously and said, “I don’t know what you mean by that. My name is Ah Lai. I was born in a town not far from the seaside named Langya Town. I came here for… to…”</p>
<p>At this point, Ah Lai was stunned, as if he couldn’t recall why he had come here.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if this person was mad or faking it, so he asked, “How did you know about the Holy Land and how did you come here?”</p>
<p>“What Holy Land? Isn’t this the Six Path Temples?” asked Ah Lai in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The Six Path Temples?” Zhou Wen was also dumbfounded. He felt like he was communicating with an alien, completely at a loss as to what the man was talking about.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s the Six Path Temples. This is…” Ah Lai realized that he couldn’t recall anything. He rubbed his head, but he still couldn’t think of it.</p>
<p>“You know that this is the Trajectory Holy Temple, right?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is one of the Six Path Temples, the Trajectory Holy Temple,” Ah Lai answered with certainty.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember why you came here?”. Zhou Wen continued asking.</p>
<p>Ah Lai thought about it, and his expression gradually turned ugly. “I seem to remember that I followed Dad onto his ship, then… then… We encountered a storm… After that… After that…”</p>
<p>At this point, Ah Lai suddenly hugged his head and screamed out in pain. Soon, he fell to the ground and twitched continuously. He passed out shortly after.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen checked his body and realized that he wasn’t faking it. Zhou Wen was confused.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with this fellow? Is he really… Impossible… He’s only seventeen… Impossible… Zhou Wen looked at Ah Lai as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Since Ah Lai didn’t wake up, Zhou Wen had no choice but to think of a way out. However, all he could see was four straight roads.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, made it carry Ah Lai, and chose a direction to walk in.</p>
<h3 id='chapter216'>Chapter 216 Trajectory Crystal</h3>
<p>There was no concept of north or south, east or west here. Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings for a long time, but he failed to discover any differences. All he could do was choose one.</p>
<p>It was no longer within Zhou Wen’s consideration whether he could pass the trial. All he wanted was to leave quickly and leave the Holy Land before getting the League’s authorities to investigate Ah Lai’s origins.</p>
<p>Every person who entered the Holy Land had their information recorded. If he had entered with the rest of them, information about him was definitely available.</p>
<p>If there’s no information about him… The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched when he thought of this.</p>
<p>The road seemed endless as it extended to the end of the horizon. After more than an hour of walking, the surrounding scenery remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized that there was something different in front of him. He quickened his pace and continued proceeding. He discovered that there was another crossroad ahead of him—it didn’t seem different from the one he had set off from. The only difference was that there was another stone statue in the middle of the crossroad.</p>
<p>The stone statue was a three to four meter tall root. The four sides of the stone statue were faces. The face that faced Zhou Wen said, “Congratulations, Human. You have completed the test and can become the representative of the Trajectory Holy Temple in the mortal world.”</p>
<p>The moment the stone statue said that, Zhou Wen felt a strong sense of aversion from the Sigh of the King. Even his emotions were affected.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen suppressed his emotions and looked at the stone face, saying, “Sorry, I don’t plan on becoming the representative of the Trajectory Holy Temple. I only wanted to get my friend out and accidentally entered.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly cursed inwardly. It’s clearly you who forcefully pulled me in. Besides, how is this a trial? It’s a forced selection.</p>
<p>“Since you are already here, why don’t you consider it? As the representative of my Trajectory Holy Temple in the mortal world, not only will you obtain a Trajectory Holy Body, you will also obtain a Mythical Companion Beast that’s compatible with it,” added the stone face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the offer, but I already have my own goals. The Trajectory Holy Temple isn’t my choice. Please open the door and let us leave this place.” Zhou Wen increasingly felt that this fellow was up to no good. One who was unreasonably solicitous was definitely hiding evil intentions.</p>
<p>The stone face didn’t say anything else. Its originally expressionless face slowly turned stiff, turning into a lifeless stone statue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shouted a few more times, but the stone statue didn’t react at all as though it was just an ordinary stone statue.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought for a moment before circling around the stone statue and continuing forward. After walking for some time, another crossroad appeared in front of him. In the middle of the crossroad was the four-faced stone pillar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen surveyed his surroundings and felt that this was the crossroad that he had previously arrived at. He couldn’t help but frown slightly, but the stone statue remained silent. All he could do was switch directions before continuing forward.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen realized that no matter where he went, he would ultimately return to the four-faced stone pillar, as though this place was an endless cycle.</p>
<p>“Why are we still here?” Ah Lai, who was on the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s back, woke up as he rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Ah Lai and suddenly had a thought. “You previously said that there was a ship inside the Trajectory Holy Temple when you entered?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a ship, one identical to the one my father worked on,” Ah Lai answered.</p>
<p>“Did you board your father’s ship before?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I did. On the first day after graduation from high school, my dad took me onto the ship,” answered Ah Lui.</p>
<p>“Then take a careful look. Have you been here before? Have you seen it before?” Zhou Wen pointed at the four-faced stone pillar.</p>
<p>Ah Lai looked at it for a while before answering with certainty, “No, I’ve never seen it.”</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen heard that, he seemed to understand something as he secretly frowned in thought. Based on Ah Lai’s situation, the people who entered the Trajectory Holy Temple will be trapped in their memories. However, since Ah Lai has never been here before and has never seen the four-faced stone pillars, this might be my memory. However, I’ve never been to such a place before, right?</p>
<p>Guide City, where Zhou Wen was born, was a flat plain. Even if there were large swaths of flat land, they were farmland. It was impossible for there to be such a large grassland. Zhou Wen was certain that he had never been here before.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Zhou Wen suddenly drew his Bamboo Blade and slashed at the four-faced stone statue.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade was extremely sharp, splitting the stone statue into two upon contact. The broken stone statue vanished with a poof.</p>
<p>The roads and plains around him vanished as well. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but break out into cold sweat when he saw the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>He was indeed standing at a crossroads, but this crossroad was not built on grasslands, but built on a volcano lava pool.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen hadn’t walked along the path and stepped onto the plains, he would probably have fallen into the lava pool.</p>
<p>In the middle of the crossroads, there was a stone platform with a black seed floating above it. It was like the condensation of night, emitting a strange and mysterious aura.</p>
<p>This aura was similar to the Sun God Crystal he had previously obtained, but there were differences.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to grab the seed with his hand, but nothing special happened. He easily removed the black seed.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The moment the black seed was removed by Zhou Wen, the entire temple quaked as the door opened once again. Zhou Wen saw Li Xuan standing outside.</p>
<p>He quickly took Ah Lu out of the temple with him. As expected, a bright light was shining from the Trajectory Holy Temple. The various engravings emitted a strange black fog, a sign that the Trajectory Holy Temple had selected an heir.</p>
<p>From then on, the Trajectory Holy Temple would shut its doors until the Holy Land opened again.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, don’t you have a body that matches the Sun God Temple? How did you pass the Trajectory Holy Temple’s trial?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in astonishment.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s going on either. I find it a little baffling.” Zhou Wen looked at the black seed in his hand and felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>He felt that the black seed had been given to him by the temple itself and not something he had obtained from a real trial. At least, he was not trapped in his memories.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen even suspected that what the four-faced stone statue had said wasn’t a test or an illusion, but to genuinely rope him in.</p>
<p>“Why bother? It’s better to have something than nothing. If the six families learn that you have actually obtained the recognition of two temples, their expressions will be very interesting.” Li Xuan chuckled.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to show off about.” Zhou Wen made Li Xuan watch over Ah Lai as he secretly snapped a picture of the black seed on his cell phone, sending it into the game.</p>
<p>He had a strange feeling that the Trajectory Holy Temple was odd, so he didn’t dare absorb the black seed directly.</p>
<h3 id='chapter217'>Chapter 217 It’s You?</h3>
<p>Trajectory God Power Crystal: A product of the God of Trajectory’s blood essence. Absorbing it will enhance one’s bloodline.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no problem with the game’s judgment, Zhou Wen allowed the blood-colored avatar to absorb the Trajectory God Power Crystal.</p>
<p>As the black power was absorbed by the blood-colored avatar, its stats changed once again. His Speed stat also increased to 21 points, and in the end, it revealed the word “Trajectory.”</p>
<p>The Trajectory Holy Temple really increases Speed. It’s quite a coincidence. Zhou Wen was secretly amused. Although he had previously believed that the Trajectory Holy Temple corresponded to Speed, the situation inside the temple was completely different from what he had imagined. Therefore, Zhou Wen was surprised that the Trajectory God Power Crystal could increase Speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan asked Ah Lai more questions, but the latter really seemed to have forgotten many things. He only remembered that he had come from Langya Town, his father was a sailor, and that he had followed his father onto the ship after he graduated from high school. Later, he encountered a storm at sea, and he couldn’t remember what happened after that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had some doubts about Ah Lai and planned on figuring out his origins after taking him out.</p>
<p>However, before that, he had to wait until the end of the Holy Land’s trials.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had originally wanted to head to the other temples to obtain their God Power Crystals to raise his four stats to 21 points.</p>
<p>But when they arrived at a few other temples, they realized that they had already completely closed. Clearly, the God Power Crystal had been taken away by someone else.</p>
<p>There are indeed hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the League. In just a few days, the God Power Crystals have been snatched away. Zhou Wen was somewhat worried about Li Xuan.</p>
<p>If the Connate Infinite physique was taken away, Li Xuan would have zero hope left.</p>
<p>As he was deep in thought, he suddenly heard the sound of thunder coming from the sky. The wind and clouds stirred as if a hole had collapsed in the sky, forming a huge vortex.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body involuntarily flew towards the vortex. He could see other people flying around the Holy Land and being sucked into the vortex.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t resist the suction force of the vortex as he allowed himself to fly into it. He even patted Li Xuan’s shoulder.</p>
<p>There was only one possibility of such a situation. The God Power Crystals of the six holy temples had been taken away by others. It was why everything had ended ahead of time, opening up a passageway to leave the Holy Land.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan didn’t mind. “Since I couldn’t obtain it, it means that I wasn’t destined to get it. It’s no big deal even if I don’t have any special physiques. With my Immortal God of Combat Life Providence, I can still forge my own path. The world is my</p>
<p>oyster.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. It might not be a bad thing not having a special physique.” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the six holy temples were somewhat odd.</p>
<p>“Alright, don’t console me. I’ve suffered too much since I was young. Such a trivial matter isn’t enough to make me depressed.” Li Xuan believed Zhou Wen was consoling him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t explain. After all, everyone wanted a special physique, and he didn’t have any evidence and was speculating without any grounds. It was pointless explaining.</p>
<p>Together with Ah Lai, the trio flew towards the vortex and arrived near it. They happened to see Pros being sucked up as well. In turn, he glared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, don’t be too happy. This matter isn’t over yet.” As he spoke, he was sucked into the vortex.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were also sucked in. Soon, they returned to the stone altar from before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to take Ah Lai elsewhere to check his identity, but he discovered that many young people had yet to leave the altar. Instead, they surrounded it, clearly targeting him and Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“Why are you crowding here? Hurry up and move aside. Do you want to fight here?” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>They could do whatever they wanted in the Holy Land, but now that they were out, they would be bound by the League’s laws.</p>
<p>Although the six families enjoyed special privileges, they did not have the privilege to openly challenge a representative of the An family here.</p>
<p>“Lance, it’s him.” No one bothered with Li Xuan. John pointed at Zhou Wen and said to Lance.</p>
<p>“You are Zhou Wen?” Lance looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.</p>
<p>“Your name is Lance?” Zhou Wen was surprised as well. Before coming, Jiang Yan had warned him that the only person he needed to be afraid of was someone named Lance.</p>
<p>“Did you cripple their Primordial Energy seas?” Lance asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Yes, but they were the ones who initiated it.” Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on explaining, but after taking a glance at Lance, he still decided to explain.</p>
<p>Lance nodded. “Actually, that’s not important. I want to fight with you. Choose the venue and time.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m the representative of the An family?” Zhou Wen knew that Lance cultivated because of his goal of defeating An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Not for anyone else. Just because you are Zhou Wen. Apart from An Tianzuo, you are the second person that has intrigued me. I didn’t plan on taking action back when they asked for my help, but since you are Zhou Wen, I’m interested in fighting you,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“But I don’t wish to fight with you. Fighting is troublesome,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a battle maniac like Feng Qiuyan. He wasn’t interested in a meaningless fight. It was time that Zhou Wen could use to game.</p>
<p>“Fight me. No matter who wins or loses, I’ll ensure that you leave the Holy City safely. If not, you will ultimately be in trouble. Those guys won’t let you off easily. Compared to fighting me, those guys will delay your gaming time more, right?” Lance suddenly came close to Zhou Wen and whispered in his ear with a voice that only he could hear.</p>
<p>“It looks like I can’t reject it, but the time and place is up to me to choose,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>
<p>Lance’s words were half-truths, but there was one thing he was right about. Those from the six families definitely wouldn’t let this matter rest. Their best chance was in Holy City, so it was impossible for them to allow Zhou Wen to leave so easily.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t expect Lance to really allow him to leave, stalling for time gave Ah Sheng time to prepare.</p>
<p>“You can choose any time and place in the next two days,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“Lance, two days is way too long…” John turned anxious as he was afraid Zhou Wen would take the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>However, Lance only smiled and said, “He won’t run, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for two days. Let’s do it tomorrow afternoon. I still want to make an early return after the fight,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, where will it be?” Lance asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll inform you when the time comes.” Zhou Wen didn’t answer directly. He planned on getting Ah Sheng to choose the location. With Ah Sheng’s abilities, he would definitely be able to choose a suitable spot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter218'>Chapter 218 Soundless</h3>
<p>In the hotel room, Ah Sheng looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“That’s what happened. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen recounted his experience in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Don’t worry, leave the rest to me,” Ah Sheng said without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Alright then. I’ll go back and prepare.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he prepared to return to his room and absorb the Mutated Fairy’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.</p>
<p>Due to the earlier stat requirements, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to master it. Now that his Speed had increased to 21, he had reached the requirement. He could then battle Lance after practicing it.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, you have to be careful of Lance. Although he’s not as famous as John, those who truly are in the know of the six families know that Lance is the most terrifying person of this generation,” Ah Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I know.” Even if Ah Sheng hadn’t said anything, Zhou Wen could sense it.</p>
<p>“He also has a nickname, Soundless.” Ah Sheng continued.</p>
<p>“Why Soundless? Is the Primordial Energy Art he cultivates related to sound?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>Ah Sheng said, “There are all kinds of sounds in this world. Every sound has its own unique rhythm and charm. Every life has the right to make its own voice, proving that they are part of this world. However, there are some voices that are loud enough and some sound softer.”</p>
<p>Ah Sheng didn’t directly mention the reason behind Lance’s nickname, but Zhou Wen already understood why. The meaning behind it was that when Lance made a sound, the entire world would quieten down. There wouldn’t be any other noise except for his sounds.</p>
<p>Returning to his room, Zhou Wen took out the Mutated Fairy Primordial Energy Skill Crystal and took a picture and took it in-game.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar held the Mutated Fairy Crystal and chose to absorb it, but Zhou Wen was notified that it couldn’t absorb it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra before the notification was removed. The crystal immediately transformed into strands of black and white auras that fused into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt as though there was a faint immortal aura flowing within him, making his body float up like a hydrogen balloon.</p>
<p>After a while, the feeling gradually disappeared until it returned to normal. Only then did the system in the game give a new hint.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed the Mutated Fairy Crystal. Attained Transcendent Flying Immortal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look at the blood-colored avatar’s information. Indeed, there was an additional skill, Transcendent Flying Immortal, not the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal technique that Zhou Wen knew of.</p>
<p>Is this Transcendent Flying Immortal a Primordial Energy Skill that only Mutated Fairies possess? Could it be a mutated version of the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill? Zhou Wen hurriedly took a look at the introduction of Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Although the other techniques of a Mutated Fairy were powerful, what Zhou Wen wanted the most was the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill. There were countless Primordial Energy Skills in the world, and there were countless powerful Primordial Energy Skills, but they only had one effectto defeat or kill the enemy.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t like to kill, and he cherished his life greatly. The Dragon Gate’s Flying Immortal Skill was undoubtedly the best life-saving technique. If he couldn’t beat his adversary, he could run, preventing them from catching up to him. It was useless even if his opponent was strong.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal: Ascension Technique for Other Realm Immortals</p>
<p>The information was very vague, but it was likely a Primordial Energy Skill similar to the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. When Zhou Wen carefully sensed the information he had obtained from the Transcendent Flying Immortal, he looked even more pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The next morning when he woke up for breakfast, Zhou Wen saw Li Xuan and Ah Lai sitting at the table chatting.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to investigate Ah Lai’s origins, but with the hoo-ha caused by the six families yesterday, he had ended up delaying the matter. Ah Lai had also followed them back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had recalled the matter on the way back. He originally wanted to take Ah Lai to the officials to investigate the identity the latter had used to enter, but after informing Ah Sheng, Ah Sheng told him that there was no need for him to go. There was no such person on the Holy Land list. Ah Sheng was very certain-if it was a person on the name list, there was no way he had never seen him before.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen very puzzled. If Ah Lai wasn’t part of the batch of people who had entered the Holy Land, where did he come from? How did he end up within the Trajectory Holy Temple?</p>
<p>“Ah Lai, what plans do you have for the future? Are you interested in hanging out with us? There’s absolutely nothing wrong with following me. I guarantee you that you’ll live in the lap of luxury. There will be endless beautiful girls.” Li Xuan seemed to be trying to seduce him.</p>
<p>Ah Lai said with an odd expression, “How did the world become like this?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what the world turns into. A good man treats the four corners of the world as his home. What difference does the place make? If you follow me in the future, I guarantee you that you will have a brighter future than being a sailor,” Li Xuan said as he patted Ah Lai on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd. Although Li Xuan wasn’t a bad person, he wasn’t that good enough to be a philanthropist. It didn’t seem like his personality at all.</p>
<p>Ah Lai didn’t reply. When he saw Zhou Wen walk over, he said, “Zhou Wen, you said that I came from inside the Trajectory Holy Temple and you also entered the Trajectory Holy Temple. Do you know why I was there?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you entered the Trajectory Holy Temple because you wanted to investigate what happened to your father’s ship. I don’t know anything else, have you completely forgotten?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Ah Lai shook his head. “I only remember that my father’s ship encountered a storm. I can’t remember what happened afterward.”</p>
<p>“There’s no rush. You can think about it slowly. Li Xuan isn’t a bad person. If you have nowhere to go, why don’t you bunk with him for now? After all, he’s rich. He’s not afraid of being bankrupted,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s right, that’s right. I’ll definitely make sure everything is the best.” Li Xuan did not retort at all, making Zhou Wen find it even odder.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Ah Lai went out for a walk, claiming he wanted to know what the world looked like; hence, he went out alone.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw Ah Lai leave, he asked Li Xuan, “Why are you so enthusiastic and nice? This isn’t like you. Tell me honestly, what are you planning?”</p>
<p>“Heavens, haven’t you noticed?” Li Xuan said in an exaggerated manner.</p>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Ah Lai is very strong.” Li Xuan seemed to find this description insufficient as he added, “He’s especially strong. At least he’s stronger than us.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement. Ah Lai didn’t seem to show any special combat ability.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I use a rope to tie him to my Companion Beast’s back? That rope was formed from a legendary nine-scaled serpent. If I were tied up by it, there’s no way I could break free. As for Ah Lai, he easily broke through it in a seemingly trivial manner.”</p>
<p>Li Xuan said, “Now that this fellow has lost his memory and there’s nowhere for him to go, isn’t it a perfect win-win situation for me to take him in while he helps me with certain matters?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter219'>Chapter 219 Battling Lance</h3>
<p>Little Lin’s Pet Combat Arena was Ah Sheng’s chosen venue for the match.</p>
<p>Many of the younger generation of the six families had come to the arena, including some who were in their twenties or thirties.</p>
<p>Back then, An Tianzuo had suppressed and crippled that generation. Now, another, Zhou Wen had appeared; he had crippled more than thirty members of the six families. This was an absolute humiliation to them.</p>
<p>Xia Bing glanced at Lance who was sitting in the resting area as she said with a complicated expression, “Thankfully, this generation of the six families produced Lance. Otherwise, they would have to swallow their anger as they did back then.”</p>
<p>She had always wanted to chase up to Lance or even surpass him, but no matter how hard she tried, the distance between her and Lance just grew further and further; so much so that she couldn’t see his back anymore.</p>
<p>Despite Lance not having inherited a hero’s physique and not cultivating his family’s Primordial Energy Art, he was able to steam ahead, making it impossible for others to even have the thought of chasing up to him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s only one Lance in this world. Xia Bing sighed inwardly, unsure if she was feeling happy or sad for herself.</p>
<p>“Here he comes,” Dugu Chuan suddenly said.</p>
<p>Xia Bing looked over and indeed saw Zhou Wen arrive in the arena with Ah Sheng and Li Xuan. The latter two remained in the spectator stands while Zhou Wen walked into the arena alone.</p>
<p>When Lance saw Zhou Wen, he stood up from the bench in the resting area and walked into the arena.</p>
<p>The members of the six families were rather calm. Others might think that Zhou Wen had a chance, but they knew better-Zhou Wen had no chance at all. No one under the Epic stage was Lance’s match. Even someone at the Epic stage might not be his match.</p>
<p>In a corner of the spectator stands sat a man and a woman. Both of them wore hats and sunglasses that covered most of their faces. However, anyone familiar with them would be able to recognize them-Liz and Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Qiao Siyuan asked as he looked at Zhou Wen and Lance.</p>
<p>Liz replied with a dark expression, “Lance is a talented genius. No peer of his is more outstanding than him. It’s impossible for Zhou Wen to win.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan said nonchalantly, “Don’t forget that Zhou Wen is someone who has come into contact with Jing Daoxian. If he was really fancied by Jing Daoxian, do you still think that Lance will certainly win?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Liz said with certainty, “Minister, you are not from the six families. Perhaps you don’t understand Lance very well. His talent is unparalleled. Unless one has absolute power to crush him, no one can defeat him.”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan only smiled and did not refute Liz’s words. Instead, he asked, “Make another confirmation. Is everyone in place?”</p>
<p>Liz nodded slightly and contacted the personnel of the Special Investigation Bureau around the arena to confirm that they had arrived.</p>
<p>“Minister, everything is in place. Zhou Wen won’t be able to escape today,” Liz said to Qiao Siyuan.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan didn’t say a word. He only looked at Ah Sheng, who was sitting in the spectator stands. Ah Sheng was wearing a trench coat and a hat. He was seriously observing the situation in the arena and had seemingly not placed any attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>With that person around, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to complete this mission. If I had a few people like Ah Sheng aiding me instead of Liz, I wouldn’t need to go through all this trouble. Qiao Siyuan sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>There were too many personnel in the Special Investigation Bureau that entered thanks to nepotism. Everyone in the six families wanted to have their own people in it, but it was hard to determine how capable those people were.</p>
<p>Although the six families did have many outstanding people, their background made many of them overly proud to the point of arrogance. Sometimes, it was difficult for them to truly become good inspectors.</p>
<p>A good inspector isn’t as simple as being strong. However, it can be considered as having pros and cons. Without these people in the bureau, the bureau wouldn’t have obtained such a huge privilege. Qiao Siyuan turned to look at Liz and said, “Get someone to keep an eye on An Sheng at all times. If he shows any abnormality, report it immediately. Even the smallest details have to be reported.”</p>
<p>In fact, Qiao Siyuan was also looking forward to seeing the people from the six families learn to give up their pride and dignity under his guidance. When that day happened, they might turn out to become the most terrifying. On that day, they might be the most terrifying inspectors.</p>
<p>However, Liz didn’t think much of it. “He’s just An Tianzuo’s adjutant. What else can he do when we’re watching him?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan could only patiently explain, “Don’t underestimate An Sheng. He has been in charge of the An family’s security for the past few years. Every year, countless people set their sights on the An family, but there have never been any problems with the An family. Such a person cannot be underestimated. Do you know another nickname he has in Luoyang’s military? Devil’s Adjutant. His name is a lot more useful in the military than An Tianzuo.”</p>
<p>Although Liz felt that the Holy City was their territory and an adjutant that was being watched couldn’t do anything, Qiao Siyuan was her superior after all. Thus, Liz immediately contacted the people responsible for watching An Sheng and exhorted them.</p>
<p>In the arena, Zhou Wen came in front of Lance. He didn’t wield any weapons as he had stowed away the Bamboo Blade in the Chaos space. He had no intention of using it.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade needed to see blood once it was drawn or it would deal a backlash to its owner. Although Zhou Wen didn’t believe in such things, he didn’t think that there was a need for him to draw his saber because he wasn’t skilled with it. It was fine using the sharp Bamboo Blade to chop up some vegetables, but fighting with Lance would instead become a flaw.</p>
<p>“They said that you have two Mythical pets. Is that true?” Lance asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Does it matter? I don’t plan on using pets,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Lance smiled brightly, revealing two rows of snow-white teeth. “I’m starting to look forward to it now.”</p>
<p>“In that case, hurry up. I’m still planning on returning home to game.” Zhou Wen took a step forward and struck out with the first stance of the Seven Distribution PalmCompunction Free-at Lance.</p>
<p>Compunction Free was a masculine move that was extremely direct and open. This stance was actually somewhat incompatible with the Ashen Palm’s forces that Zhou Wen had trained in. However, Zhou Wen still managed to fuse the power of the Ashen Palm into this move.</p>
<p>Lance didn’t dodge either. He also struck out with his palm to meet Zhou Wen’s. His palm turned purplish-red, looking like a special Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a pricking pain in his palm and couldn’t help but retract his palm. However, Lance’s chest quivered violently as he took two steps back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at his palm and saw that it was covered with bloody holes that seemed to be a result of countless needles. He couldn’t help but say, “What a vicious Primordial Energy Skill.”</p>
<p>“Likewise. Your Primordial Energy Skill is also very vicious,” said Lance with a smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter220'>Chapter 220 A Person That Fights As Though In A Game</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen used the seven stances of the Seven Distribution Palm one by one. They were disjointed with completely different styles. Zhou Wen’s continuous usage made it difficult for his opponent to adapt to such changes in style.</p>
<p>However, Lance acted as though he didn’t feel anything. He blocked and parried all of Zhou Wen’s seven strikes. Furthermore, apart from the first palm, the Ashen Palm’s forces that were secretly included in the Seven Distribution Palm, none of them were able to injure Lance.</p>
<p>When the mild concealed force touched Lance’s palm, it immediately dissipated, unable to enter his body.</p>
<p>After striking seven times, Zhou Wen immediately retracted his hands and said to Lance, “I only know these seven strikes. Since all seven of them were countered by you, I have no choice but to admit defeat.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you want to admit defeat, but you have to satisfy me first.” Lance didn’t care what Zhou Wen said as he charged forward and struck out with a Wind Lightning Fist.</p>
<p>The Wind Lightning Fist was a relatively common fist-type Primordial Energy Skill in the district where Lance lived in. The punch contained the power of wind and lightning. There was no need for any powerful technique as it used brute strength to subdue the enemy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that it was impossible for Lance to let him off so easily. When he saw Lance deliver the punch, he used the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and circled around him.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen learned the Transcendent Flying Immortal, the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill hadn’t been replaced. Clearly, the former wasn’t a Primordial Energy Skill. There was still a difference between the two.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen really only knew the seven palm strikes and had no time to learn other techniques.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Zhou Wen dodge, Liz sneered. “Zhou Wen is finished. In front of Lance, retreating is equivalent to losing.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Liz. Everyone who had sparred with Lance, including Xia Bing and Dugu Chuan, knew how scary it was to let Lance take the initiative to attack. No one could remain undefeated under his relentless attacks.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan’s movement techniques were considered top-notch among his peers, but he managed fewer than twenty of Lance’s strikes.</p>
<p>With just two punches, Zhou Wen could sense the pressure that Lance was exerting on him. His attacks were unique, something that Zhou Wen had never seen before.</p>
<p>Although a fist combo was common as a combat technique, when it came to actual combat, the fist combo was actually of not much use. Unless one could hit the opponent with the first punch and leave the opponent open for more attacks, the subsequent chaining of the fist combos wouldn’t be possible.</p>
<p>However, if the first punch was enough to hit the target, then one should strive to take down one’s opponent with that one punch. What was the point with the remaining punches?</p>
<p>Therefore, the fist combo was just a supplementary measure. What was really effective was the first punch that hit the opponent. How could one connect the first punch? This was the answer everyone wanted to know.</p>
<p>However, Lance’s fist combo was different. He was like a character in a fighting game. His moves were connected without any gaps, giving Zhou Wen no chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>It even made Zhou Wen have the illusion that if he revealed any flaws and allowed him to connect the first strike, then the subsequent attacks from Lance would be like a raging storm that would directly KO him without giving him any chance to react.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill had been pushed to the extreme by Zhou Wen as he constantly dodged. His arms and legs were also fending off the attacks from Lance. Every clash of their limbs made Zhou Wen feel a terrifying force surge at him, causing his bones to protest in pain.</p>
<p>What looked like ordinary punches and kicks produced an effect that resembled an extremely explosive Primordial Energy Skill. It left Zhou Wen very surprised.</p>
<p>Soon, he realized that Lance’s seemingly ordinary punches and kicks were everything but ordinary. It was really some kind of Primordial Energy Art that greatly augmented him in his Strength and in all other aspects.</p>
<p>Every action of Lance’s was supported by different Primordial Energy Skills. This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen someone fight like that.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had only practiced Primordial Energy Skills with his fists and palms, he had never trained his other parts. All he could do was use the Lotus Flower Buddha Body to protect himself. However, the defensive strength of the Lotus Flower Buddha Body wasn’t enough for Zhou Wen to fight Lance head-on. Every clash of their bodies made Zhou Wen feel like his bones were about to break apart. All he could do was dodge with his movement techniques.</p>
<p>However, there was no way to completely dodge Lance’s crazy attack. Just a dozen punches placed Zhou Wen at an absolute disadvantage.</p>
<p>When Dugu Chuan saw this, he laughed. “Do you want to use your movement technique to dodge the attacks of Lance and hope for him to expend all his Primordial Energy? You’re too naive. This strategy might work on others, but against a person like Lance, it’s useless. That was what I thought back then, but I ended up being pummeled.”</p>
<p>Xia Bing said faintly, “Back then, in order to act as a character in a combat game, Lance had specially learned a Primordial Energy Art that allows rapid Primordial Energy recovery. Furthermore, in order to reduce the Primordial Energy expenditure, he had found dozens of the most basic Primordial Energy Skill Crystals. Those Primordial Energy Skills themselves used up very little Primordial Energy to begin with. After he learned them, he raised dozens of Mortal stage Primordial Energy Skills from Rank 1 all the way to Legendary Rank 10. Not only are they extremely powerful, but they also consume very little Primordial Energy. Lance completed something so unthinkable to the average person in just four months.”</p>
<p>“If I had the talent of Lance, I could be as willful as him. I could also abandon my hero physique and not learn the family’s Primordial Energy Art. I could also play games all day like him,” John said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Although he was known as a saint at Covenant College, he knew very well that he was far inferior to the fellow who gamed all day in school. No matter how hard he worked, he was not even qualified to be his opponent.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>When the fists collided, Zhou Wen felt a surge of power penetrate his body. It ran up his arm, making his organs feel like they had suffered a heavy blow. He couldn’t help but take a few steps back.</p>
<p>Lance could actually use concealed forces, but they were just not as strong as Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm.</p>
<p>The look in Zhou Wen’s eyes gradually turned serious. He had never encountered such an opponent before. Among his peers, no one had ever given him such pressure.</p>
<p>Although An Jing had defeated him with one strike back then, that was an absolute difference in Speed and Strength due to their difference in level. That kind of battle had nothing to do with Zhou Wen’s abilities. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had never learned any combat techniques back then.</p>
<p>This time, it was different. In terms of physical strength at the same level, Zhou Wen felt immense pressure. This was something he had never experienced before.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan is right. Lance is much more terrifying than John. Zhou Wen’s heart gradually burned with passion. Although he knew that beating Lance was not beneficial to him, he still wanted to win; he didn’t want to lose.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Wen was a seventeen-year-old. He was unable to completely control his young and competitive heart, especially when facing a peer like Lance.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had spent too much time practicing his Primordial Energy Art in the past. He had an excessively low starting point and had spent his golden years cultivating Ascetic Meditation which ended up being useless. Eventually, it was replaced by the Lost Immortal Sutra.</p>
<p>After that, he continued gaming and grinding instance dungeons. His level and physique had been enhanced, and he had obtained quite a number of Primordial Energy Skills. Fighting ordinary people with these was enough, but against someone like Lance, he was still greatly lacking.</p>
<h3 id='chapter221'>Chapter 221 Flying Immortal Skill</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen calmed down. The more he was placed in such situations, the calmer he became.</p>
<p>He had pushed the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits as he dodged like a ghost and attacked Lance from time to time.</p>
<p>It’s still not enough. If my movement technique could be a little faster, and if this transition move of mine in midair could be a little more sudden, and the angle a little smaller… Zhou Wen constantly gained insight into the battle, and his Raising a Weighted Feather realm had become increasingly proficient as he used it.</p>
<p>“Fifteen punches, and he still isn’t using a Companion Beast?” Dugu Chuan was somewhat astonished. Zhou Wen’s dodging and ducking had allowed him to withstand fifteen of Lance’s punches.</p>
<p>“It should be soon. In less than ten punches, Zhou Wen will definitely use his Companion Beast. Otherwise, defeat is the only outcome for him.” Xia Bing could tell that Zhou Wen was about to reach his limit.</p>
<p>Lance’s attacks became more and more incisive, making Zhou Wen feel like he wasn’t facing a single person, but a massive tsunami. He had the feeling that he was powerless to resist.</p>
<p>Under such terrifying attacks, Zhou Wen could keep pushing himself and make his every move simpler and more efficient, just as Lance had done.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to be able to use all sorts of Primordial Energy Skills like Lance. Therefore, he could only bet everything on his movement technique-to make it faster, stronger, and more efficient.</p>
<p>Even if it was just a millimeter, he had to try his best to shave as much as he could, so that his body wouldn’t produce any additional movements to squeeze out every bit of potential and possibility.</p>
<p>The countless deaths he had experienced in-game now played a tremendous role. This was because Zhou Wen experienced the same thing when the blood-colored avatar faced death. Therefore, even in such a disadvantageous situation, he could still maintain his clarity of mind and focus, allowing him to devote himself to battle without any distractions. It was a talent of his.</p>
<p>Gradually, Zhou Wen’s movement technique exceeded the limits of Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and fused with his unique style.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt that Lance’s attack wasn’t as difficult to resist as his motion trajectories seemed to be able to keep up with Lance’s attack. Even if he didn’t use his palm to block, just using his movement techniques allowed him to slowly dodge Lance’s continuous attacks.</p>
<p>How can that be! Dugu Chuan widened his eyes as he looked at Zhou Wen. As a person who was proficient in all kinds of movement techniques, he had naturally studied a famous Primordial Energy Skill like the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. He even knew it himself. Furthermore, his Dragon Gate Fairy Skill was not inferior to Zhou Wen’s in terms of ranks.</p>
<p>However, Dugu Chuan had better movement techniques, so he rarely used Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.</p>
<p>Back when Zhou Wen used Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, and the way he kept switching between styles left Dugu Chuan somewhat impressed. However, it was only praise attributing to Zhou Wen’s ingenious way of using such a method to push the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to Rank 10.</p>
<p>However, it was just a compliment. He also had Rank 10 movement skills that were even more outstanding than Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. However, he hadn’t lasted more than twenty blows under Lance’s barrage of attacks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s current movement technique clearly exceeded the realm of Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, but it had the foundation of the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. Dugu Chuan had also seen similar movement techniques—the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill possessed by the Epic dimensional creature, Fairy.</p>
<p>Although the difference between the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill seemed to be just in its name, the two were worlds apart.</p>
<p>The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill came from a Fairy Monkey, but the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill came from a real branch of the Fairy. There was an insurmountable difference in quality between the two.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was at the Legendary stage, so it was impossible for him to master the Dragon Gate’s Flying Immortal Skill now. Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s movement technique previously indicated that he had indeed never learned it before.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen’s movement technique had hints of the Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill.</p>
<p>Did he raise the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to the Epic stage without using Primordial Energy Crystals, having only relied on his battle experience and insight? Dugu Chuan’s expression was capricious.</p>
<p>If one’s comprehension of a Primordial Energy Skill reached Rank 10, it was something only a genius was capable of. But to directly raise the Primordial Energy Skill to a whole new level, especially if one hadn’t reached that level, would be too terrifying.</p>
<p>Although Dugu Chuan didn’t wish to believe that Zhou Wen could reach such a level, his movement techniques were becoming more and more pronounced with the bearing of the Dragon Gate’s Flying Immortal Skill. That poise and elegance was something the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill didn’t possess.</p>
<p>This person seems a little scary. Dugu Chuan suddenly had such a feeling.</p>
<p>Xia Bing also looked at Zhou Wen in astonishment. She wasn’t an expert with movement techniques like Dugu Chuan, but she could tell that Zhou Wen was dodging more easily. It was as though Lance’s attacks were increasingly unable to force him to block with his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body was like a flying immortal. When Lance threw a punch, his fist remained three inches away from Zhou Wen’s body, preventing him from hitting him.</p>
<p>It felt like Zhou Wen was using the wind generated by the first to gracefully float back in the air.</p>
<p>Although Dugu Chuan was right, he wasn’t completely right. Zhou Wen’s movement technique had indeed imitated the Fairy’s movement technique, but it wasn’t an ordinary Fairy’s movement technique, but a mutated Fairy’s.</p>
<p>He had infused the Mutated Fairy’s movement technique he had seen into the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, causing it to gradually transform, forming a brand new movement technique.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou’s movement skills are getting more and more impressive, but why does this fellow like movement techniques so much? Isn’t it better to fight head-on? Don’t you think so?” Li Xuan clearly didn’t appreciate Zhou Wen’s style; he still preferred to attack directly.</p>
<p>An Sheng, who was sitting beside Li Xuan, remained silent as he continued watching the battle.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan would occasionally look at the duo, and when he saw this scene, he couldn’t help but frown slightly.</p>
<p>After some thought, Qiao Siyuan asked Liz beside him, “Ask the guy monitoring Ah Sheng. Is there anything abnormal there?”</p>
<p>Liz was in a bad mood when she saw that Zhou Wen had managed to dodge Lance’s attack. She said, “It should be fine. If there’s anything, they should report it.”</p>
<p>“So should I hand over the post of minister to you then?” Qiao Siyuan’s voice turned cold.</p>
<p>When Liz met Qiao Siyuan’s cold gaze, her heart turned cold and she hurriedly said, “I’m sorry, Minister. I’ll ask immediately.”</p>
<p>Liz didn’t dare to be negligent. She immediately contacted the surveillance personnel and only after confirming it repeatedly did she tell Qiao Siyuan, “An Sheng hasn’t done anything out of the ordinary. He’s been watching the competition the entire time.”</p>
<p>“Something’s wrong… But what…” Qiao Siyuan’s expression did not change because of what Liz had said.</p>
<p>Just as Liz was about to say something, Qiao Siyuan suddenly stood up, quickly left his spot, and walked to the other side of the spectator stand. It was right across from Li Xuan and Ah Sheng.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan stared at An Sheng like an eagle. He kept sizing up his face, and the more he looked at him, the worse his expression became.</p>
<p>An Sheng was wearing a trench coat and a hat, but he didn’t deliberately lower his hat or wear sunglasses. He looked like Ah Sheng, but Qiao Siyuan was certain that it wasn’t him.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s heart turned cold immediately.</p>
<h3 id='chapter222'>Chapter 222 A Battle Without Limits</h3>
<p>“Minister, what happened?” Liz walked over as well. She followed Qiao Siyuan’s gaze and also recognized An Sheng. She took a look but didn’t notice anything abnormal.</p>
<p>“I was too careless. That guy was only wearing a hat. He didn’t lower his cap or wear glasses, he even revealed his entire face so as not to arouse my suspicion. I should have known that An Sheng wouldn’t sit here and watch the competition without doing anything… All personnel is to immediately report their locations…” Qiao Siyuan was no longer in the mood to teach Liz. He directly issued the order to everyone through the comms.</p>
<p>Everyone reported their positions one by one, and Liz could hear them clearly from her earpiece. After all the personnel had finished reporting, she said, “Minister, everyone is at their designated spots. Everything is normal and there’s nothing out of the ordinary. What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan’s expression was as cold as ice. Ignoring Liz, Qiao Siyuan directly said on the channel, “An Sheng, I know you’re listening. Answer me.”</p>
<p>In the monitoring room of the Little Lin’s Pet Combat Arena, An Sheng was sitting on a chair. He was looking at Qiao Siyuan through the surveillance footage. The two inspectors beside him were like puppets sitting there mechanically.</p>
<p>Hearing the voice from the walkie-talkie, An Sheng said calmly, “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Liz thought that Qiao Siyuan had gone crazy, but when she heard the voice coming over the comms, her expression immediately turned ugly and she wore a look of incredulity.</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan took a deep breath and said, “Don’t hurt my people. During this period of time in the Holy Land, the bureau will not do anything.”</p>
<p>Killing an inspector in Holy City was an extremely serious offense. Most people wouldn’t dare do so, but Qiao Siyuan could not forget An Tianzuo’s words. He also couldn’t forget how An Sheng had crippled Liz without any thought.</p>
<p>The title of Devil’s Adjutant was not just a simple name. As long as An Tianzuo gave the order, An Sheng would do anything. He was a lunatic.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Sit down and drink some water. This match is very exciting. Don’t you want to finish watching it?” An Sheng said as he watched the surveillance camera footage.</p>
<p>“An Sheng, if you dare to harm even a strand of their hair, I will make sure none of you can leave the Holy Land…” Liz said angrily.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Qiao Siyuan suppressed his voice and stopped Liz. Then, he sat back down on the spectator stands and surveyed the entire Little Lin’s Pet Combat Arena.</p>
<p>If he found An Sheng’s location before the competition ended, there was still a chance of a comeback.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when he saw a camera in the arena, Qiao Siyuan’s eyes lit up. He got up and prepared to leave his seat, but An Sheng’s voice came through the earpiece again. “Minister Qiao, you better sit there and not move. From now on, one of your inspectors will die with every step you take. I wonder if the lives of these inspectors are enough for you to reach the monitoring room? If there’s enough, you can take your time walking. I’ll be sitting here waiting for you to send me to jail. This is Holy City, so it’s not like I can run, right?”</p>
<p>Qiao Siyuan gritted his teeth and returned to his seat. He said dejectedly, “You won. Don’t hurt them.”</p>
<p>“Enjoy this match. It looks like it will be really exciting,” An Sheng said calmly.</p>
<p>In the arena, Lance’s eyes shone as if he had seen a classic game he had long wanted. He couldn’t hide his smile.</p>
<p>“How interesting. It’s indeed interesting to have an opponent in a fighting game,” said Lance as he stopped his attacks.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ve already said that I don’t like to play fighting games. I don’t understand what that feeling is,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>However, Lance ignored Zhou Wen’s words as he continued, “Do you know why I like to play games? It’s because, in reality, I can’t find a match, so I can only find joy in games. The rules and skills in the game restrict my performance, which makes me feel a sense of difficulty. Unfortunately, a game is still a game after all. There are still rules that can be found. No matter how the mechanism is adjusted, once one knows the rules, after playing for some time, one can easily defeat them. This is also why I do not wish to know anything about An Tianzuo before meeting him. I’m afraid that I will discover a pattern. That will make defeating him boring.”</p>
<p>“Then you can try leveling up games. There will always be a stronger boss waiting for you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s an even stronger boss? It’s just tweaked strength and skills to make it stronger. In essence, it’s no different from those ordinary monsters. Powerful bosses are identical in every way, but an interesting soul has a different charm to it.” Lance stared at Zhou Wen with a fervent gaze. “It’s been a long time since I had such a great battle. You are the one who has made me reacquire the joy of combat. I originally imagined I would find it again on the day I meet An Tianzuo.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I prefer to hunt those soulless bosses,” Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.</p>
<p>“No, you aren’t that kind of person. You are just like me deep down. You thirst for battle,” said Lance as he relaxed his body. As he walked towards Zhou Wen, he said, “Let me see what your limit is.”</p>
<p>With that said, Lance suddenly moved. However, this time, he didn’t use his continuous combo attacks like a game. At the instant he moved, his speed left behind images that instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tapped his toes on the ground as he rapidly retreated. However, in the next second, the Lance in front of him turned blurry. The real Lance appeared above Zhou Wen’s head like a god that had descended to the mortal world. Along with it came his fist that crashed down with a terrifying battle aura.</p>
<p>Even the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, after its evolution, couldn’t dodge the punch. Zhou Wen gathered strength for Golden Palm and used the Seven Distribution Palm’s Sky-Supporting Pillar to meet Lance’s fist.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The battle aura blasted out as terrifying forces caused Zhou Wen’s legs to sink into the specially-made rubber ground.</p>
<p>With the clash of powers, Lance’s figure strangely used the force in the air as leverage. He turned blurry once again, leaving behind an afterimage. His true body had already plummeted to the ground like a meteor, shattering the ground through the quaking. At the same time, he sent another punch straight at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With Zhou Wen’s legs sinking into the ground, it was already impossible for him to dodge. He switched the Primordial Energy Art to a Dao Body and used Astral Suction Palm at the same time. He sucked and guided Lance’s fist, causing it to tilt to the side as his body brushed past Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Lance’s reaction was too fast. In the split second, he passed him by, he leveraged the momentum from the charge to twist his body and kicked Zhou Wen like a sweeping blade.</p>
<p>His actions happened in one swift motion. It was unworldly.</p>
<p>His Primordial Energy Skill… seems to have broken through the rules of a Legendary stage’s rank… Xia Bing looked at Lance as she felt mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Dugu Chuan also smiled bitterly to himself. Lance had gone even further than they had imagined. He had never been serious in their previous battles.</p>
<h3 id='chapter223'>Chapter 223 Transcendent Flying Immortal</h3>
<p>Lance had trained his combat skills to the extreme. If Zhou Wen were to focus on training his combat skills for a few years, he might still have a chance to match Lance. But now, Zhou Wen was unable to fight Lance with pure combat skills.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t waste his time. His combat skills were indeed inferior to Lance’s, but he also had his strengths and unique traits.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no way to dodge, Zhou Wen suddenly released a stream of power that shot up from his legs that had sunk to the ground. Almost instantly, he shot up into the sky, dodging Lance’s foot.</p>
<p>Lance’s actions weren’t slow either. A terrifying power erupted beneath his feet as he charged towards Zhou Wen, bringing with him numerous afterimages. His entire body was burning with a raging battle aura like a volcano eruption.</p>
<p>“This Lance… is so powerful…” Even Li Xuan had to admit it. Li Xuan would only qualify to be beaten if he went up alone.</p>
<p>Xia Bing, Dugu Chuan, and the others all had smiles on their faces as they waited for the moment Lance won.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t dodge Lance’s attack on the ground, much less dodge in the air.</p>
<p>Indeed, there’s no one at the same level who can fight Lance. If Zhou Wen were to use a Companion Beast, he might be able to hold out for a little while longer. To think he wants to engage in melee combat with Lance shows how naive he is. However, Zhou Wen can hold his head high after fighting so well with him, thought Dugu Chuan.</p>
<p>Liz was also feeling delighted. Their operation had completely failed, and they were being threatened. She felt aggrieved, but now that Lance could defeat Zhou Wen, it was the only thing that would cheer her up today. Now, all she wished for was for Lance to cripple Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy sea, giving him the taste of being crippled.</p>
<p>But in the next second, everyone’s jaws dropped in disbelief.</p>
<p>In the air, Zhou Wen’s figure seemed to be completely free from the limitations of gravity, as though he had transformed into lightning. He streaked across the sky in a zigzag manner and quickly charged forward. His target was Lance who had rushed into the air.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit burned in his eyes as his battle aura flared wantonly. His bodily functions were also pushed to the limit as he twisted his body. He threw a barrage of quick punches to block Zhou Wen’s attacks that appeared like lightning bolts. Due to his actions being too fast, he left behind afterimages, making it seem like he had multiple limbs that could block the lightning-fast phantoms.</p>
<p>However, no matter how fast Lance’s actions were, he was still inferior to Zhou Wen’s lightning-like attacks that criss-crossed like a net. Even with his multi-limbed form, he failed to withstand the unparalleled barrage of attacks. In the end, he was unable to withstand it. After being struck in the chest by a beam of light, his defensive stance instantly crumbled as the criss-crossed figures struck Lance’s body like bolts of lightning that passed through his body.</p>
<p>The final figure fused together to reveal Zhou Wen’s body as he struck Lance’s chest and immediately sent him flying.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Lance fell to the ground and cracked the ground while blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>The spectator stands fell completely silent. The members of the six families, including Dugu Chuan and Xia Bing, were all in disbelief. They couldn’t believe that Lance would be beaten by someone and even bleed. They had never imagined such a scene.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person who had defeated Lance was a youth about the same age. The scene of the criss-crossing of lightning bolts left them extremely shocked.</p>
<p>Liz was so infuriated that she nearly vomited blood. She yearned to mobilize the troops to immediately tear Zhou Wen into pieces.</p>
<p>Lance stood up from the ground, ignored the blood trickling down the corner of his mouth, and stared at Zhou Wen. “What was that move called?”</p>
<p>“Transcendent Flying Immortal,” Zhou Wen replied.</p>
<p>“Transcendent Flying Immortal? I’ll remember that. I’m very happy that I’ve finally found a path for me to continue advancing. I hope that you can give me more surprises the next time we fight.” With that, Lance collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>His injuries were too severe and he was suffering from internal injuries. To be able to stand up and persist to the end of the conversation with Zhou Wen showed how unparalleled his willpower was.</p>
<p>The medical staff immediately rushed into the arena to save him. Fortunately, Lance had only fainted. Although he was heavily injured, his life wasn’t in danger. With his physical condition, he would make a quick recovery.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen left the battlefield and left Little Lin’s Pet Combat Arena with Li Xuan.</p>
<p>Xia Bing and company watched Zhou Wen leave, but no one stopped them. Their expressions were extremely complicated.</p>
<p>They hadn’t witnessed An Tianzuo’s incident with their own eyes, back then, but now, they had personally experienced everything. The Transcendent Flying Immortal’s name was like that person. It would probably stay on their minds for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>After leaving the arena, Zhou Wen and company boarded a car and drove out of the Holy City.</p>
<p>The driver was none other than An Sheng. As for the An Sheng sitting beside Zhou Wen, he took off his hat and wiped the disguise from his face. It was Ah Lai.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’m afraid that your name will be marked by the six families in the future. You must be more careful of where you go,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and didn’t say a word. He thought about his battle with Lance. If he didn’t have Transcendent Flying Immortal, he would definitely have lost. If Lance had learned a Primordial Energy Skill that matched Transcendent Flying Immortal, he would have equally lost.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, although level and Primordial Energy Skills are important, combat techniques can’t be neglected. I’ll have to continue learning from Teacher when I return. Zhou Wen secretly made up his mind. He had to make up for his lacking combat techniques when he returned.</p>
<p>An Sheng originally thought that they would encounter a lot of trouble on their way out of Holy City, but he was puzzled that nothing happened. As a result, many of his preparations were useless.</p>
<p>In the medical ward, Lance was sitting by the bed. Beside him was a long-haired girl peeling an apple.</p>
<p>“Has Zhou Wen and the rest left Holy City?”. asked Lance.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, everything has been done. The ones from the other families have been stopped.” The girl passed the peeled apple to Lance.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I’ll definitely beat him next time.” Lance took the apple and took a bite.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to win, why didn’t you use your Life Providence?” The girl seemed to think that as long as Lance used his Life Providence, he would definitely have won.</p>
<p>“That would be boring,” said Lance in excitement. “Although I lost this battle, it made me understand something. Previously, I only pursued combat techniques, but I neglected the ultimate attacks found in games. In the past, I could defeat my opponents with ordinary offensive techniques, but a fellow like Zhou Wen couldn’t be defeated so easily by me. Likewise for An Tianzuo, so if I can learn several Primordial Energy Skills like Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal, mixing it with my combat techniques, that would be even more interesting…”</p>
<p>Looking at Lance’s focused and excited expression, the girl by his side listened quietly with a gentle smile.</p>
<h3 id='chapter224'>Chapter 224 Boundary Stone</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed. His Strength and Speed had been enhanced by the God Power Crystals, making him break through to 21 points.</p>
<p>However, his Primordial Energy and Constitution were still unable to break through. Now, he had no God Power Crystals to obtain unless he waited another ten years for the Holy Land to open again to head to the temples once more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait another ten years. Even if he could, the An family probably wouldn’t give him the spot.</p>
<p>How do I get my Constitution and Primordial Energy to break through to 21 points? Zhou Wen had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>Since there are God Power Crystals in the Holy Land, they might exist in other dimensional zones as well. I can only look around in the game dungeons. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the Golden Flying Ant and the white cocoon.</p>
<p>Now that his Dragon Gate Fairy Skill had improved and he had mastered Transcendent Flying Immortal, he might have a chance of obtaining that white cocoon.</p>
<p>“I was planning on taking you to the dimensional zones that we didn’t have a chance to visit when we returned, but I think we can forget about it now. We’ll go again when we have the chance,” said An Sheng as he drove.</p>
<p>No one objected. Zhou Wen had offended the six families terribly, so it wasn’t appropriate for them to continue wandering outside. It was best they returned to Luoyang as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As he was afraid that something would go wrong, An Sheng didn’t choose to take the plane back. He drove all the way until they arrived at a mountain road where they saw a girl waving at them in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>The car stopped and they saw that the girl’s ankle was severely injured as if she had been bitten by something. The wound was very deep and her bones were injured.</p>
<p>“I was attacked by a dimensional creature nearby. All my Companion Beasts died in battle and I couldn’t walk due to my injuries. Can you take me to a nearby city?” the girl requested.</p>
<p>“You were injured in this area? There shouldn’t be any dimensional zones nearby, right?” Li Xuan asked the girl.</p>
<p>“I thought that too, but a dimensional creature appeared here. I nearly died because of it,” the girl said.</p>
<p>“Where did you encounter dimensional creatures? What kind of dimensional creatures were they?” An Sheng stared at the girl and asked.</p>
<p>“It was on a mountain road about a kilometer ahead. It’s a snow-white ape-shaped dimensional creature…” The girl recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>After An Sheng heard this, he agreed to let the girl hitch a ride.</p>
<p>Li Xuan found an opportunity while An Sheng was checking the car and whispered to him, “Brother Sheng, is there a problem with this woman? We just offended the six families and ended up meeting an injured woman in the wilderness. Isn’t this too much of a coincidence?”</p>
<p>“If she has a problem, then all the more reason I should take her with me. I’d rather keep the enemy in my hands,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Li Xuan felt that it made sense and stopped talking.</p>
<p>As the car continued its journey, Zhou Wen saw that there were many signs of a battle. There was quite a lot of rubble and terrifying claw marks on the road. This woman didn’t seem to be completely lying. At the very least, there had been a fight here. As for whether her opponent was a dimensional creature or a human, it was hard to tell.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was very good at talking with women, so he quickly started chatting with her.</p>
<p>The woman said her last name was Zhang, Zhang Yuzhi—from the Eastern capital. She was a dimensional creature hunter who was a freelancer.</p>
<p>Typically, even if one entered a dimensional zone to adventure or kill dimensional creatures, they would join large organizations or the League’s organizations.</p>
<p>Only a small number of people chose to become a freelancing hunter. They would enter dimensional zones to hunt dimensional creatures alone or with a few friends.</p>
<p>This woman was only in her early twenties. According to the current education system, most people went to university at the age of 16. After four years of college, they would only be in their early twenties. It was surprising that a newly graduated woman would choose to become a freelance hunter.</p>
<p>There was also something that left Zhou Wen and company very concerned. The Eastern Capital was very close to Luoyang, and it was now under Luoyang’s jurisdiction. This woman was from the Eastern Capital, so she happened to be on the same path as them.</p>
<p>While Li Xuan and Zhang Yuzhi were chatting, he deliberately asked a lot of questions about the Eastern Capital. Zhang Yuzhi answered them proficiently like she was a native. She even knew some of the tinier shops in the old alleys.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the place Zhang Yuzhi mentioned that she had encountered the dimensional creature, they didn’t see white ape. Instead, there were many fallen stones on the road ahead that blocked the way.</p>
<p>Li Xuan went down to clean up the road and swept the rubble to the bottom of the mountain. However, after moving the rubble away, he realized that there was a corpse beneath it.</p>
<p>The corpse was a white ape, similar to Zhang Yuzhi’s description. It was undoubtedly the same one she had seen before.</p>
<p>“You killed it?” An Sheng looked at the white ape’s corpse and asked Zhang Yuzhi.</p>
<p>“No. It nearly killed me. It killed all my Companion Beasts, so how could I have the ability to kill it?” Zhang Yuzhi shook her head with certainty.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. If you didn’t kill it, why would it die here?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. Maybe there’s someone else here.” Zhang Yuzhi scanned her surroundings, but this was one of the curvy mountain roads. There was no one here. One side of the mountain road was a cliff, while the other side was a straight mountain wall. It was impossible to hide anyone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also looking at the corpse and saw a bloody hole in the white ape’s chest. It was as though someone had dug its heart out and it had died a tragic death.</p>
<p>“Get in the car. Let’s continue moving.” An Sheng moved the white ape’s corpse to the side and got into the car.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to get into the car, he glanced to the side in passing and realized that there was a Boundary Stone erected by the roadside.</p>
<p>Boundary Stones weren’t rare. In the past, they were used to divide the boundaries between regions, cities, and countries. Some even demarcated the borders between villages. Boundary Stones were used to separate territories.</p>
<p>After the dimensional storms, no one really used the Boundary Stones anymore. This was because most regions had dimensional zones, making it difficult to divide them.</p>
<p>There were still some Boundary Stones remaining that were often seen. However, they were of no use now.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a rare sight to see one here, but what was rare was the tiny palm symbol on it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very familiar with the palm symbol. Although it looked inconspicuous in the corner of the Boundary Stone, he saw it at a glance.</p>
<p>In the strange palm symbol was a skull. It looked even eerier.</p>
<p>And the four words carved on the Boundary Stone didn’t look like a location’s name. The four words were actually “Yin Yang Boundary Stone.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter225'>Chapter 225 Red Clothes</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen took out his cell phone and snapped a picture of the Boundary Stone. Indeed, it was downloaded into his interface.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what are you doing? Get in the car!” Li Xuan shouted at Zhou Wen from inside the car.</p>
<p>“Look at this Boundary Stone. There seems to be a problem,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at it.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company alighted from the car and walked to the Boundary Stone. Li Xuan said with a glance, “Is this a prank?”</p>
<p>An Sheng walked to the stone monolith and touched it. He dug the soil under the stone monolith with his hands before he frowned and said, “This stone monolith wasn’t buried recently. It has existed here for a long time. It doesn’t seem like a prank.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a prank? Why would there be such a thing as a Yin Yang Boundary Stone? Could it be that after crossing the Yin Yang boundary, one will reach the netherworld?” Li Xuan joked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if we will enter the netherworld, but there’s nothing wrong with being careful. All of you, be on your guard.” An Sheng carefully looked around but didn’t find anything unusual.</p>
<p>There was only one path on the mountain. Furthermore, there were no dimensional zones nearby. An Sheng couldn’t directly turn back just because of the appearance of such a Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “Ah Sheng, let’s switch paths. I think there’s something off about the area up ahead. Could it be a newly appeared dimensional zone?”</p>
<p>“Not a bad idea.” An Sheng nodded slightly. He also felt that something was amiss. However, if he had to take a detour, they would have to travel another additional ten hours or more.</p>
<p>He turned the car around and drove back the way they came. He drove to a fork at the foot of the mountain and made his way to another mountain road. He continued driving along another path that was a huge detour. Furthermore, it wasn’t easy to drive on, limiting the car’s speed.</p>
<p>The path was riddled with potholes and it was extremely difficult to drive across it. The car was shaking violently as Zhou Wen looked at his phone. The download had been completed, and the Yin Yang World icon had appeared on the phone’s home screen.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen usually only played the Ant Nest dungeon in front of others. Now that there were so many people, it was not appropriate for him to open the Yin Yang World’s instance dungeon.</p>
<p>After driving for half a day, the tremors were so intense that Zhou Wen felt like his bones were about to fall apart. Li Xuan and Ah Lai felt a little uncomfortable as well, and the three nearly fainted.</p>
<p>Screech!</p>
<p>A sudden slamming of the brakes woke the three of them up. Their heads almost squeezed against the back of the front row.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, what happened?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“There’s another Boundary Stone in front of us,” said An Sheng before he opened the door and got out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company followed. Indeed, there was a Boundary Stone by the side of the mountain. On it were the same words: ‘Yin Yang World.’ However, Zhou Wen didn’t see the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Must it be that creepy?” Li Xuan looked around. It was almost getting dark, so there was a limit to what he could see.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, is there another way?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s it. Now, most of the dimensional zones have cut off the routes available. If we want to take another detour, we will have to leave this mountainous area, but it would take too long.” An Sheng thought for a moment before saying, “How about this? It’s getting dark and there aren’t any street lamps. It won’t be convenient for us to go back. Let’s find a place to camp. After daybreak, we can return to the airport and take a plane back.”</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do that then.” Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to risk crossing the Yin Yang World’s stone monolith.</p>
<p>An Sheng took out a simple tent and other tools from his car and found an empty space by the side of the road. He set up a tent and placed a few warning pins to prevent any other vehicles from crashing into their tents while driving past.</p>
<p>Although there was a small possibility of cars passing through, An Sheng still managed to consider everything.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and Zhang Yuzhi were chatting while Ah Lai started a fire to prepare some food.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat in the car and was about to open the Yin Yang World instance dungeon to see what was inside when he suddenly heard Li Xuan’s surprised voice. “What is that?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got out of the car and looked over. He saw Li Xuan pointing in the direction of the Yin Yang Boundary Stone with a look of shock.</p>
<p>He looked over and saw a woman in red standing on the other side of the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>To be precise, it was likely a woman wearing a red wedding dress. Zhou Wen had seen such clothes when he was watching television when he was young. It was said to be a rather ancient tradition.</p>
<p>Women nowadays wore white wedding gowns when they got married. In the East District’s ancient times, white was something only when there was a death in the family. People wore red for marriage.</p>
<p>The daughters of rich families all wore embroidered red silk wedding gowns, with a red veil covering their heads. The groom would only be able to remove the bride’s red veil on their wedding night.</p>
<p>The woman standing on the other side of the Yin Yang Boundary Stone was like a bride dressed in red from a television drama. She had a red veil over her head and was standing behind the stone monolith, seemingly looking at them.</p>
<p>“Who’s trying to act mysterious there?” Perhaps the trembling Zhang Yuzhi had triggered Li Xuan’s male hormones. At that moment, Li Xuan was shockingly bold as he shouted at the woman in red behind the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>The woman in red didn’t respond and stood there motionless. Although the red cloth covered her head, it didn’t deter Zhou Wen and company from feeling as though she was staring at them.</p>
<p>Without any response from the woman in red, Li Xuan became somewhat angry. He summoned a Legendary black-eyed leopard and ordered it to pounce at the woman.</p>
<p>An Sheng, Zhou Wen, and company stared at the black-eyed leopard. It quickly passed the stone monolith and leaped into the air, bearing its sharp claws as it pounced at the red-dressed woman.</p>
<p>The next scene caused the five of them to widen their eyes as their scalps tingled.</p>
<p>The black-eyed leopard actually passed through the woman’s body, as though her body was just an illusion.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me we’ve really run into ghosts?” When Li Xuan saw this scene, he felt a little nervous.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of guns or bullets, but a ghost would still make him feel uneasy even if he was strong.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was just about to order the black-eyed leopard to continue attacking when he saw the woman’s body move. Only then did everyone notice that the woman’s feet were not touching the ground. She had always been levitating in midair, so they could clearly see the red floral embroidered shoes on her feet.</p>
<p>Due to the Boundary Stone’s obstruction, everyone had imagined that she was standing there. Upon seeing this scene, they had the urge to flee. Even Zhou Wen was no exception.</p>
<p>When he was young, he had heard many ghost stories from his grandfather. One of them was the story of the ghost bride. He thought to himself, Did I really encounter a ghost bride?</p>
<p>When his grandfather told the story of the ghost bride when he was young, it scared Zhou Wen so much that he didn’t dare sleep the entire night. The moment he fell asleep, a red-dressed female ghost came looking for him, determined to kill him. It was a childhood nightmare.</p>
<h3 id='chapter226'>Chapter 226 Breaking Out of the Seal</h3>
<p>However, Zhou Wen only felt a little creeped out. He didn’t really turn around to run. He knew that even if she was a ghost bride, she was only a dimensional creature.</p>
<p>He now possessed the strength of a Legendary stage, so there was no need for him to be afraid of any ghost brides.</p>
<p>Li Xuan seemed to have shared the same thoughts as he grew bolder. He ordered his black-eyed leopard to once again pounce at the ghost bride.</p>
<p>The ghost bride also rushed towards the black-eyed leopard. Their bodies met in mid-air, and the black-eyed leopard once again passed through the ghost bride’s body, unable to hurt her at all.</p>
<p>However, when the black-eyed leopard landed, it let out a tragic whimper as it staggered to the ground. There was a bloody hole in its chest, as though someone had dug its heart out.</p>
<p>Companion Beasts were manifestations of life crystals, so they naturally didn’t have a real heart. However, such an injury caused the black-eyed leopard’s body to collapse. A Legendary pet was gone just like that.</p>
<p>From the way the black-eyed leopard died, it looked almost identical to the white ape from before.</p>
<p>After the ghost bride killed the black-eyed leopard, she stood behind the Boundary Stone and looked at Zhou Wen and company without any intention of rushing over.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t dare to cross the Boundary Stone!” Upon realizing this, Li Xuan immediately became emboldened. He summoned another Legendary pet and had it charge at the ghost bride.</p>
<p>Previously, he and Zhou Wen had robbed quite a number of Legendary Companion Eggs in the Holy Land. He had obtained quite a number from the splitting of the spoils, so he had hatched a few out of boredom on the way. Now, it was a good opportunity to use them.</p>
<p>A snake-shaped Legendary pet rushed in front of the ghost bride and spat out a mouthful of venom. However, the venom didn’t manage to touch the ghost bride’s body. After passing through it, it landed on the ground.</p>
<p>The snake lunged at her and attempted to coil itself around her. However, it was useless. The ghost bride was a ghost that couldn’t be touched.</p>
<p>In turn, the snake pet’s body had an additional five claw holes that caused it to die.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was enraged. He was just about to summon another Companion Beast to fight the ghost bride but was stopped by An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Don’t waste your Companion Beasts. That should be a dimensional creature that’s a ghost type. Ordinary physical attacks are ineffective against ghost-type dimensional creatures,” said An Sheng as he summoned a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company didn’t even see what the Companion Beast looked like as it transformed into a wooden fish-one that a monk often used—that fell into An Sheng’s hands.</p>
<p>An Sheng struck the wooden fish a few times. Zhou Wen and company didn’t find anything special about the sound it produced, but the ghost bride’s body trembled as though her body had been punched.</p>
<p>An Sheng kept striking the wooden fish, but the ghost bride’s body stopped trembling. The sound of the wooden fish seemed to have lost its effect on her.</p>
<p>An Sheng frowned slightly. “This Buddhist wooden fish is considered an excellent-grade item among the Legendary stage. It is effective against ghost-type dimensional creatures; yet, it can’t injure this ghost bride. From the looks of it, her level isn’t low.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you have any other Companion Beasts that are effective against her?” asked Li Xuan.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any. Not all Buddhist Companion Beasts can restrain ghosts. I only obtained this Buddhist wooden fish by chance. I’ve never used it before.” With a pause, An Sheng added, “From the looks of it, this place has indeed formed a new dimensional zone. Furthermore, it’s a dimensional zone that is filled with ghost-type dimensional creatures. Thankfully, Young Master Wen was meticulous and discovered the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. If we had rushed in, we could have died inside without any Companion Beasts that are effective against ghost-type dimensional creatures.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen secretly felt ashamed. If he hadn’t seen the palm symbol, he wouldn’t have noticed that there was something amiss with the Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it. I don’t believe that there’s no Companion Beast that can deal with her.” Li Xuan refused to believe it as he summoned a few more Companion Beasts. However, all of them were killed by the ghost bride without exception. Furthermore, they couldn’t even touch the ghost bride’s body. Li Xuan was so infuriated that he nearly vomited blood.</p>
<p>However, Li Xuan only relied on his numerous Companion Beasts. He wouldn’t dare fight the ghost bride himself.</p>
<p>Humans usually relied on their Companion Beasts to open up a path in new dimensional zones. Even so, deaths were frequent. For example, if Zhou Wen and company had entered the Yin Yang World by mistake, it would have been very easy for them to be killed by ghosts even if they had many Companion Beasts.</p>
<p>The few Companion Beasts that Li Xuan had hatched had been killed by the ghost bride. He still had a few other Companion Beasts, but they were all excellent-grade ones he had specially selected. He couldn’t bear to use the Companion Beasts like the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and Thundergod General. If they were to be killed by the ghost bride, his heart would ache terribly.</p>
<p>Although Li Xuan couldn’t accept this outcome, he gave up on attacking her.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the ghost bride drifted out from behind the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>“No good, she’s a creature that has broken out. Get in the car and leave immediately.” An Sheng’s expression changed. He rushed in front of everyone and shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>They didn’t dare to delay any further. They ignored the tent and went straight into the car. However, they realized that the car couldn’t be started.</p>
<p>The color of the bonfire lit turned from yellow to blood red. It made them reel with anxiety.</p>
<p>The ghost bride ignored An Sheng, who was standing in front of her, and floated over to Zhou Wen and company. A cold glint flashed in An Sheng’s eyes as he struck the ghost bride’s body with his palm that had produced lightning. Instantly, the ghost bride retreated dozens of feet and floated far away.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, why didn’t you say earlier that lightning is effective against ghosts? Let me help you.” Li Xuan was delighted when he saw this. He hurriedly summoned his Thundergod General and transformed him into the Thundergod Sword. As he held it in his hand, he slashed at the ghost bride.</p>
<p>When the Thundergod Sword slashed at the ghost bride with lightning bolts, the ghost bride stretched out a pale hand and grabbed the Thundergod Sword. Then, with a strong swing, she threw Li Xuan and the sword out together.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s body slammed into the mountain wall and immediately, his face was swollen. Even his bridge of his nose was fractured.</p>
<p>“The power of the lightning element deals a certain level of damage to ghosts, but the effects are still greatly reduced. When I used the power of an Epic-stage lightning bolt to hit her, it only achieved about 10-20% of its effect. What’s the use of that bit of lightning power of yours?” As An Sheng spoke, he struck out with another palm of lightning, sending the ghost bride flying again.</p>
<p>However, it was only enough to send her flying. He was still unable to seriously injure the ghost bride.</p>
<p>The ghost bride was forced back by An Sheng time and time again, but she pounced forward again and again. The situation was tense.</p>
<p>“We don’t have the strength or Companion Beasts that are effective against ghosts. It’s very difficult to kill her. I’ll hold her back. You guys leave first. We’ll rendezvous at Dadong Town,” said An Sheng.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he heard An Sheng’s words. He summoned Truth Listener. This fellow was a Mythical pet from Small Buddha Temple. Furthermore, the legendary Truth Listener was a soul-suppressing beast of hell. Perhaps it was possible that it had the ability to counter ghosts.</p>
<p>Just as Truth Listener was summoned, its eyes flashed with golden light as it stared intently at the ghost bride. In the next second, Truth Listener transformed into a golden beam of light that tore towards the ghost bride.</p>
<h3 id='chapter227'>Chapter 227 Jinxes Husband</h3>
<p>Truth Listener transformed into a golden beam of light and instantly appeared in front of the ghost bride. The ghost bride’s body trembled as a result. Facing the Epic-stage An Sheng, the ghost bride hadn’t shown any fear, but now, she turned around and attempted to escape.</p>
<p>However, Truth Listener clearly wasn’t letting her go. It pressed its claw on her back and it seemed to resemble a golden seal that left a mysterious golden branding on the ghost bride’s back.</p>
<p>No matter how far she ran, her body shimmered with golden light. Soon, her soul dissipated amidst the golden light, dropping a red crystal.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s tiny claw grabbed the red crystal and leaped back with a whoosh, landing in Zhou Wen’s palm. It then placed the red crystal in his hand.</p>
<p>Li Xuan widened his eyes as he looked at Truth Listener, who resembled a golden-silk monkey in Zhou Wen’s palm. He asked in surprise, “Old Zhou, what kind of pet is that? Why is it so awesome?”</p>
<p>An Sheng also sized up Truth Listener in surprise, clearly very curious.</p>
<p>“A Legendary Companion Beast. However, it has Buddhist attributes, so it should be effective against ghosts. Probably the reason why it killed the ghost bride so easily.” Zhou Wen unsummoned Truth Listener and carefully looked at the red crystal in his hand before realizing that it was a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“Ghost-type Companion Beasts are very rare at the moment. Typically, a ghost-type Companion Beast can avoid physical attacks and most of its attribute attacks. However, typically speaking, a ghost-type Companion Beast’s attack strength is relatively weaker. They are more adept at curses. This ghost bride’s offensive strength was very powerful, so it’s relatively rare among ghost-type pets. Although she’s only at the Legendary stage, she will be very useful when exploring new dimensional zones due to her characteristics. Even if she were to encounter an Epic creature, she probably wouldn’t be killed unless the opponent is of a counter attribute,” An Sheng said as he looked at the Companion Egg in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen threw the ghost bride Companion Egg at An Sheng, who was slightly taken aback when he caught it. “Young Master Wen, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I’m still a student, so I naturally don’t have the chance to explore new dimensional zones. It’s useless keeping her around. Take this with you to the military. Perhaps it can reduce the number of military sacrifices.” An Sheng had spent a lot of effort taking care of them along the way. It could even be said that he had risked his life. All Zhou Wen wanted was to do something in return.</p>
<p>Although ghost bride Companion Beasts were rare, Zhou Wen had already downloaded the Yin Yang World’s instance dungeon and had Truth Listener who was effective against the ghost bride. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to obtain ghost bride Companion Beasts in the future.</p>
<p>“A Companion Egg can’t solve the military’s problem. It will be of great use if there’s a large number of ghost brides.” As An Sheng spoke, he returned the ghost bride Companion Egg to Zhou Wen. “Young Master Wen, if you really wish to help the military, you can join after graduation. You will definitely be of help with your capabilities.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see when the time comes,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head. Even if he wanted to join the military, he had no plans of joining An Tianzuo’s unit.</p>
<p>As though he had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts, An Sheng shook his head slightly and said nothing more.</p>
<p>They packed their things and followed the path back. Even with an Epic expert like An Sheng around, they couldn’t randomly enter an unknown dimensional zone and risk their lives. Furthermore, this dimensional zone had the most bizarre ghost-like creatures.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, quickly hatch that ghost bride and take a look. I want to see what she looks like. After you hatch her, get her to remove the red veil for us to take a look,” Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen when they got into the car. He was curious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also wished to see the ghost bride’s stats, but it wasn’t convenient for him to use his cell phone in front of Li Xuan and company. He listened to Li Xuan and took out the ghost bride Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen seldom hatched Companion Eggs himself as he typically hatched them in-game. With the Companion Egg in hand, he injected his Primordial Energy into it. Immediately, he felt his Primordial Energy flow into the Companion Egg like it overflowed a dam. Soon, all the drops that flowed out were gone. There was even a feeling that he had provided an insufficient amount.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. Although his Primordial Energy had yet to reach 21 points, he still had 20 points. Typical Legendary Companion Eggs that could be hatched with 18 or 19 Primordial Energy were already considered excellent-grade. Yet, the ghost bride found 20 Primordial Energy points insufficient. This made it rather impressive.</p>
<p>She sure is a powerful creature that dared to walk out of the dimensional zone. She really seems different. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and forcefully survived the pressure the Companion Egg exerted on him. Thankfully, he had a Dao Body and his Primordial Energy recovered quickly. It wasn’t difficult for him to last through the ordeal.</p>
<p>The Companion Egg was finally hatched as it transformed into a red glow that imprinted onto Zhou Wen’s forehead. It transformed into a red dotted tattoo that resembled a red birthmark on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Quickly summon her and take a look,” Li Xuan said eagerly.</p>
<p>“It’s so crowded in the car. How do I summon her?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Your intelligence sure is lacking. She has a ghost body. Nothing in the car can touch her,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head. “Let’s wait until we arrive at a rest area.”</p>
<p>He found an opportunity when no one was watching to glance at the ghost bride’s stats and never expected her name to really be Ghost Bride.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Wife of the Ghost King</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 20</p>
<p>Constitution: 19</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 21</p>
<p>Talent Skills: Ghost, Spirit Suction, Yin Wind Claw, Jinxes Husband.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Ghost Eyes.</p>
<p>Her Primordial Energy is actually at 21 points. Isn’t this a stat point that only Mythical Creatures have? How can ordinary Legendary creatures reach such a level? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Seeing her talent skills, his expression turned even odder. How is jinxing a husband considered a skill?</p>
<p>Looking at her companion form, he had no idea what Ghost Eyes meant. He could only guess that the Ghost Bride could become an eye.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was studying the Ghost Bride’s stats when he suddenly felt An Sheng brake. The tires screeched as it dragged across the road, producing ear-piercing sounds.</p>
<p>Li Xuan was about to doze off, so without sitting properly, he slammed into the back of the seat in front of him. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhang Yuzhi, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, let out an extremely sharp scream. “In front… there are ghosts in front…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked ahead where the car lights shone. Immediately, their expressions changed. A group of white-robed ghosts appeared on the main road ahead of them. They walked over in a daunting manner, and amongst them, there were even ghosts carrying a red-painted coffin. When they walked over, the entire sky seemed to be enveloped by a terrifying ghostly aura. Instantly, the surroundings became a place filled with ghosts.</p>
<p>The white-robed ghosts had long green fangs that didn’t resemble human teeth. As for the red coffin, there was a strange black gas emitting from it. It looked ghastly and terrifying.</p>
<h3 id='chapter228'>Chapter 228 Ghost Tide</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen and company’s faces turned grim. There were countless ghosts in front of the mountain path. They were carrying a coffin, like a funeral procession.</p>
<p>When they were about a hundred meters away from Zhou Wen and company, the ghosts that carried the coffin stopped. However, it was a momentary pause. In the next second, the ghosts roared and charged forward like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>“There’s no other way. We can only storm through.” An Sheng summoned a dagger and opened the door to get down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, Ah Lai, and Zhang Yuzhi got out of the car. Zhang Yuzhi’s face was pale, but she was already prepared for battle. Clearly, she knew that it was useless no matter how afraid she was. She had to storm through.</p>
<p>“You guys follow behind me.” An Sheng took charge and stared at the approaching ghosts. When they were about five meters away from him, the dagger in his hand finally moved.</p>
<p>The dagger brought with it a beam of light that resembled a blade. The blade beam slashed at the surging ghosts, instantly cleaving through the first row of ghosts that were leading the charge. The few ghosts behind were struck by the impact, and their bodies were sent flying backward.</p>
<p>Although the might of one strike appeared powerful, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. If An Sheng’s blade beam was facing ordinary Legendary creatures, it would probably have killed a large number of them.</p>
<p>However, this strike only managed to kill the first four ghosts, and they were only ordinary Legendary ghosts. Clearly, the effect of An Sheng’s strength was limited when dealing damage to a ghost.</p>
<p>In an instant, the legion of ghosts inundated Zhou Wen and company as they attacked from all directions.</p>
<p>An Sheng was in charge of leading the charge while Ah Lai and Li Xuan defended the flanks. Zhou Wen stood at the back while the injured Zhang Yuzhi, who had lost all her pets, remained in the middle to guard against the occasional one that slipped through their defenses.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s gaze was cold as he constantly brandished his dagger. Wherever the blade beam hit, even ghosts were forcibly cut through. A path of destruction emerged from the sea of ghosts as he charged forward with Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Although the Thundergod Sword in Li Xuan’s hand was limited in effect against the Ghost Bride, it was still effective against ordinary ghosts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his Invincible Connate Divine Art seemed to have a certain effect on them. Although he wasn’t capable of slaying the ghosts like An Sheng, he still caused the ghosts beside him to howl in pain.</p>
<p>Ah Lai’s situation was somewhat odd. He was clearly a little afraid and had apparently not cultivated any specialized combat techniques. It did not seem like he had been augmented by any Primordial Energy Skills, but when his fists struck the ghosts, he was able to send them flying. A few ghosts were nearly blasted apart by him.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan is right. Ah Lai does indeed possess immense power.” Zhou Wen was relatively relaxed. Truth Listener was right in front of him. When ghosts charged at him, Truth Listener would charge out like a stream of light, dissipating a ghost with a single swipe of its paw.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. The ghosts that slipped through the cracks would suffer a strike of his palm. He discovered that with the augmentation of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, hitting a ghost was no different from hitting a living creature. It directly shattered the ghost’s head.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra does have the ability to restrain ghosts. Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease. According to their current situation, if they were only blocked by this legion of ghosts, they should be able to tear through the obstacle.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had an ominous feeling when his gaze landed on the red-painted coffin that emitted black gas.</p>
<p>An Sheng led the group all the way forward, killing countless ghosts along the way. There were many ghost crystals that dropped on the ground, but none of them had the time to pick them up.</p>
<p>Truth Listener seemed to enjoy the crystals of these ghosts as it charged forward like lightning and devoured them. It reveled in the killing and, without waiting for Zhou Wen’s instructions, he took the initiative to kill the nearby ghosts.</p>
<p>It was very effective against ghosts. Legendary ghosts basically just needed one swipe of its claw. Those ghosts had no ability to resist it at all.</p>
<p>The five of them continued their relentless assaults in the midst of the ghost tide, almost closing in on the coffin.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the agitation caused by the group’s slaying of ghosts, the red-painted coffin that emitted black gas began to shake violently. Just as Zhou Wen and company were less than ten meters away from it, the lid suddenly opened and a hand extended out, pressing it to the side of the coffin.</p>
<p>It was as pale as snow with long, slender fingers. They looked like bones wrapped in skin, but the nails were silver, long and sharp, like sharp blades.</p>
<p>And there seemed to be a faint black gas emitting from that hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart sank as An Sheng’s expression turned solemn. They continued charging forward without a word.</p>
<p>The ghost hand pressed down hard on the coffin, and a figure slowly stood up. It was a person with white hair and black armor. There was even a ferocious ghost mask on its face and a faint black gas emitted from its body-one that exuded a sinister charm.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost slowly floated up from the coffin as it stared at Truth Listener and An Sheng. The next moment, it seemed to teleport and appeared in front of An Sheng. It thrust its silver fingernails at An Sheng’s head like five sharp daggers.</p>
<p>An Sheng quickly reacted as he whipped his dagger upwards and slashed at the ghost’s hand like a streak of light, giving it a great impulse.</p>
<p>“Retreat,” An Sheng said with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Li Xuan knew that something was amiss. Behind them was the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. If they retreated, they would retreat into the Yin Yang world.</p>
<p>An Sheng clearly knew that this was the case; yet, he still got them to retreat. Clearly, they had encountered a very serious problem. Even he was not confident about defeating the black-armored, white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>Without another word, Zhou Wen charged back with Truth Listener. Li Xuan, Ah Lai, and Zhang Yuzhi followed closely behind.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng didn’t retreat. He held onto the dagger and stared at the black-armored, white-haired ghost intently.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost also looked at An Sheng as the black aura around it became more obvious. As for the other ghosts, they appeared to not see An Sheng at all. They no longer attacked him and instead charged at the escaping Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>An Sheng’s aura grew stronger as a strange light rose up from his body as if a demon had possessed him. The purple light seemed to dye his body purple. Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only heard a terrifying explosion from An Sheng when he saw ghostly auras rise up. It was mixed with a strange purple hue. Countless ghosts had been dispersed.</p>
<p>However, there were just too many ghosts, and countless ghosts were still rushing at them. Without An Sheng holding back most of the ghosts, their situation immediately became dire.</p>
<p>Although Truth Listener was effective against ghosts, it was a Legendary pet after all. It could only kill one ghost at a time without a mass attack. With it only killing one ghost, more ghosts would lunge at them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter229'>Chapter 229 Yin Yang World</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen charged forward as he constantly punched out with his fists, but he could only send two or three ghosts retreating.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more ghosts surrounding them, Zhou Wen and company were unable to move far. They were trapped in their spots. Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy and sent a gust of Grand Yin Wind at the ghosts ahead of them.</p>
<p>A strong gust of wind blew past, instantly blowing away the large group of ghosts ahead. However, after the ghosts were blown away, they quickly lunged forward again, not suffering too much damage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the power of the Grand Yin Wind was an Yin-elemental wind. As for ghosts, they were of an extreme Yin nature. The wind attribute of the Grand Yin Wind was effective against them, but the Yin attribute wasn’t of much use. All he could do was send them flying, but he couldn’t freeze them.</p>
<p>It’s good enough to send them flying. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as he charged forward. His Dao body quickly recovered his Primordial Energy, and once he did that, he would fan the back.</p>
<p>Li Xuan blocked most of the ghosts in the rear, but the wounds on his body kept increasing. With Zhou Wen’s fanning, a large number of the ghosts behind them were sent flying, giving Li Xuan some breathing space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, the Saber Shield Knight, Demonized General, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, but the effects weren’t that great.</p>
<p>Among them, only the Golden Warrior’s Golden Palm did significant damage to the ghosts. The damage dealt to the ghosts by the other pets’ attacks was very limited and was of not much use.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen unsummoned them. This was the real world. They died permanently here with no way to revive them. These were excellent-grade Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen had; he couldn’t bear to send them to their deaths.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the Ghost Bride and saw her figure move erratically. Wherever the pale-white hands with red nails touched, a ghost’s head would be pierced through by her claws. Then, the ghost would be absorbed by her palm, turning her nails even redder like blood.</p>
<p>The Ghost Bride’s wanton killing was much more efficient than Zhou Wen’s. She shared the burden for the four of them.</p>
<p>With the aid of the Banana Fairy, Truth Listener, and Ghost Bride, Zhou Wen and company finally arrived at a spot not far from the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>From time to time, earth-shattering explosions could be heard from afar, making Zhou Wen and company feel much more at ease. At least they knew that An Sheng was still battling the black-armored, white-haired ghost-he hadn’t been killed.</p>
<p>However, they were also in a daze. An Sheng only wanted them to rush back, but he didn’t tell them what to do. Now that they were about to reach the Yin Yang Boundary Stone, were they to cross it?</p>
<p>There was no way out after being chased by ghosts. If they entered the netherworld again, it could only be worse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who was at the forefront, couldn’t help but look in the direction of the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. When he saw it, his pupils immediately constricted as though he had seen an extremely terrifying scene.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t!” Li Xuan also looked in the direction of the Boundary Stone and immediately exclaimed when he saw it.</p>
<p>Behind the Boundary Stone was a group of red-dressed female ghosts. Their numbers were in no way lesser than the white-robed ghosts they were facing. At that moment, they were behind the Boundary Stone like a sea of red flowers.</p>
<p>However, the red-dressed female ghosts were somewhat different from Zhou Wen’s Ghost Bride. Although they were dressed in red, they were only dressed in ordinary red robes. They weren’t bridal gowns, nor were there red veils that covered their faces. Their faces could be seen.</p>
<p>The female ghosts didn’t look ugly and were actually rather pretty. However, their faces were pale and looked ghastly. Their fingernails were long and sharp. Although they didn’t look ugly, they appeared extremely frightening.</p>
<p>“Out of the frying pan and into the fire. We are really in big trouble this time,” Li Xuan cried out loudly. His Immortal God of Combat Life Providence and the Invincible Connate Divine Art made him nearly immortal as long as he wasn’t immediately slain. But even so, such a crazy battle was a huge burden on him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also secretly lamenting. The white-robed ghosts had the black-armored, white-haired ghost that even An Sheng was not necessarily able to beat. They definitely couldn’t escape in that direction.</p>
<p>However, the red-dressed female ghosts weren’t to be trifled with either. Furthermore, after entering the dimensional zone, who knew what else was there. Perhaps, there was a large number of black-armored, white-haired ghosts inside. If they charged in, they would only end up dead.</p>
<p>Instantly, the four fell into a dilemma. They could neither advance nor retreat, and could only fight the white-robed ghosts with all their might.</p>
<p>However, there was no way to continue fighting like this. Humans didn’t have inexhaustible stamina. The Dao Body could recover Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy, but it was impossible for it to completely recover his stamina. Zhou Wen was already beginning to feel exhausted, and he had no idea how long he could last.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s and Ah Lai’s situation wasn’t any better. The depletion of their stamina wasn’t any less than Zhou Wen’s. Zhang Yuzhi was the worst. She limped as she barely managed to fight. She had already suffered quite a few injuries.</p>
<p>If not for Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Ah Lai taking care of her occasionally, she would have long been killed by the ghosts.</p>
<p>“It’s not a solution if this goes on. Instead of dying so pathetically, why don’t we charge back and kill the black-armored, white-haired ghost with Brother Sheng? If we succeed, we can successfully escape. Even if we don’t succeed, we’ll just die gloriously in battle. It’s better than dying here because of being overwhelmed,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings and suddenly said, “Don’t go back yet. Let’s approach the Yin Yang Boundary Stone a little closer.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen had already used the Grand Yin Wind to lead the way as he charged towards the red-dressed female ghosts. However, his Grand Yin Wind was only used to fan the white-robed ghosts away; he didn’t attack the red-dressed female ghosts.</p>
<p>Although they did not know what Zhou Wen was up to, Li Xuan and Ah Lai followed without any hesitation. Soon, they arrived in front of the Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>At that moment, they discovered a strange scene. None of the red-dressed female ghosts standing behind the Boundary Stone charged over.</p>
<p>As for the white-robed ghosts, none of them came close to the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. They gathered on the other side of the Boundary Stone as they bared their fangs and brandished their claws at Zhou Wen and</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>The white-robed ghosts and the red-dressed female ghosts looked at each other across the Boundary Stone. The ghosts on both sides were eyeing Zhou Wen and company covetously, but none of them charged forward. It made the four who were trapped around the Boundary Stone feel alarmed yet relieved.</p>
<p>After fighting for so long, the four of them were exhausted. They leaned close towards the Yin Yang Boundary Stone but were unable to rest. The white-robed ghosts and red-dressed female ghosts on both sides were less than a meter away from them. The terrifying ghastly claws that were waving around seemed to be able to pierce a few holes into their bodies at any moment.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, are we saved now?” Li Xuan said with a sullen expression as he looked at the ghastly claw waving in front of him.</p>
<p>“The food and drinks are all in the car. We are trapped here. Even if these ghosts don’t harm us, we won’t be able to live for long. Do you think we are saved?” Zhou Wen sized up the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. He hoped that he could find a way out.</p>
<p>However, beyond that was ghastly and terrifying. Fog was everywhere, making it impossible to see what was inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the potent collisions in the distance vanished as the night turned silent. It made Zhou Wen and company feel their hearts in their throats.</p>
<p>“Did Brother Sheng win?” Li Xuan swallowed his saliva with great difficulty. If An Sheng didn’t win, he probably had been harmed by the black-armored, white-haired ghost. This also spelled doom for them.</p>
<p>Their gazes were fixed on the road. Soon, Zhou Wen and company’s expressions became extremely nasty. They saw the black-armored, white-haired ghost fly over in the sky, its head of white hair fluttering in the wind, like a devil coming into this world.</p>
<h3 id='chapter230'>Chapter 230 Ghost King</h3>
<p>“Let’s charge in.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth when he saw the black-armored, white-haired ghost charging at them. He got up and charged towards the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>With the Grand Yin Wind clearing the path, the red-dressed female ghosts were sent flying dozens of meters away.</p>
<p>Li Xuan and company also knew that facing the black-armored, white-haired ghost would only lead to death. Without any hesitation, they followed Zhou Wen past the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.</p>
<p>Despite the Grand Yin Wind sending many female ghosts flying dozens of meters away, there were just too many red-dressed female ghosts. Soon, more red-dressed female ghosts surrounded them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen fanned again, blowing away the female ghost in front of him as he ran desperately inside with the trio.</p>
<p>Not long after the four of them ran in, the black-armored, white-haired ghost charged to the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. However, he didn’t hesitate like the white-robed ghosts and rushed straight in.</p>
<p>The moment he entered, the red-dressed female ghosts seemed to break into a frenzy. All of them began screaming as their hair stood on end. They charged at the black-armored, white-haired ghost fearlessly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were pleasantly surprised when they saw this.</p>
<p>“Holy sh*t, all hell’s breaking loose!” Li Xuan cried out in pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>However, their pleasant surprise didn’t last long. When the group of red-dressed female ghosts pounced at the black-armored, white-haired ghost, the black gas emitting from the latter suddenly blasted outwards, producing a shockwave. It instantly obliterated all the red-dressed female ghosts within a twenty-meter radius.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost ignored the red-dressed female ghosts and flew towards Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>The four of them felt their hearts turn cold. The black-armored, white-haired ghost could kill a group of red-dressed female ghosts without even laying his finger on them. Such strength was a calamity for them.</p>
<p>Although the red-dressed female ghosts continued charging forward fearlessly, they had no effect on the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Just a surge of his black gas evaporated and dissipated them, leaving only a few ghost crystals falling to the ground.</p>
<p>The four of them only managed to run for about a hundred meters before the black-armored, white-haired ghost caught up to them. He extended his ghastly claws and grabbed at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The black gas condensed into the shape of a ghastly claw and, despite being more than ten meters away, appeared in front of Zhou Wen instantly and was about to hoist him up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the banana fan and fanned it at the black gaseous claw. The Grand Yin Wind swept over, blowing away all the black gas.</p>
<p>However, before Zhou Wen and company could rejoice, the black-armored, white-haired ghost released another claw. A gigantic ghastly hand, formed from black gases grabbed at Zhou Wen, its speed so fast that it was almost impossible to dodge.</p>
<p>The Grand Yin Wind had just been used and Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy had yet to recover. Unable to use it again, all he could do was pull out his Bamboo Blade and slash at the black gaseous claw.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride and Truth Listener attacked the black gaseous hand at the same time. The Yin Wind Claw and the golden beam of Truth Listener’s claws almost struck the black gaseous claw simultaneously.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The black gaseous claw was shattered by the two pets, but Zhou Wen felt his hands go numb as his Primordial Energy was nearly drained.</p>
<p>“Run separately!” Zhou Wen could tell that he was the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s target. He immediately ran in another direction.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost indeed chased after him without any hesitation. The red-dressed female ghosts that approached him were dissipated as though he was a demon king in the flesh.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt worse than the black-armored white-haired ghost. By using the Great Yin Wind to rid the red-dressed female ghosts in front of him, there was no way to deal with his pursuer. Furthermore, the black-armored, white-haired ghost was obviously much faster than him. In a blink of an eye, he had caught up to him.</p>
<p>As though he knew that the black gaseous claw was useless against Zhou Wen, the black-armored, white-haired ghost grabbed at him with his hand. It was as fast as an illusion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and used the Bamboo Blade to produce Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Instantly, the sky lit up as Zhou Wen’s speed suddenly increased. Like lightning, he slashed at the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s body.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Sounds of metal ringing sounded incessantly as the extremely sharp Bamboo Blade struck the black armor of the white-haired ghost. It was unknown what the armor was made of, but it looked like black jade. When the Bamboo Blade struck it, only white scuff marks were left behind, failing to split the armor apart.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost floated in the air, blocking Zhou Wen’s attack without even lifting his palm.</p>
<p>The instant Transcendent Flying Immortal ended, the black-armored, white-haired ghost extended his hand and instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen, moments from grabbing his neck.</p>
<p>The difference in speed was too great, so Zhou Wen didn’t even have a chance to dodge.</p>
<p>Truth Listener appeared on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as a golden light flashed across its claws. It was as though it was wearing a mysterious hex seal as it moved towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Its palm was branded with a golden mark that made him retract his hand as if he had been pricked by a needle. As for Truth Listener, it was sent flying. It tumbled in the air a few times before landing on the head of a red-dressed female ghost. She was so frightened that she didn’t dare move.</p>
<p>Truth Listener didn’t look injured. After baring its teeth and crying out loud, it leaped up once again, rushing towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>The ghost shook his hand and immediately, the golden flame-like branding on his palm was drowned by the black gas. Then, he shot out a plume of black gas, immediately sending Truth Listener flying.</p>
<p>W</p>
<p>Truth Listener was only at the Legendary stage. Despite being struck by the black-armored, white-haired ghost twice, it remained unharmed. However, there was nothing it could do about the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Before it could reach him, it was sent flying by the hand formed by the black gas.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. If Truth Listener could advance to the Epic stage, it would probably be able to fight the black-armored, white-haired ghost or even suppress it. Now, it could only be trounced.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost seemed to know that Truth Listener was a nemesis of ghosts, making it difficult to kill. Therefore, he only sent Truth Listener flying before ignoring it. With his body phasing away, he appeared in front of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was already prepared as he fanned at him, sending the black-armored, white-haired ghost flying back more than a hundred feet.</p>
<p>However, just as he retreated, the white-haired ghost’s figure blinked again. It was so fast that Zhou Wen had no time to recover his Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>It was already too late for Truth Listener and Banana Fairy to save him. Zhou Wen could only use Ghost Bride to ward off his assailant, but Ghost Bride appeared to be extremely afraid of the black-armored, white-haired ghost. She didn’t dare rush forward to help Zhou Wen ward off the disaster.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately cursed inwardly. Typical Companion Beasts were absolutely obedient. They wouldn’t hesitate even if they were ordered to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Only a Mythical pet like Truth Listener and Banana Fairy had a certain level of self-awareness. He never expected Ghost Bride to have her own consciousness and even know fear.</p>
<p>However, with the Ghost Bride’s hesitation, Zhou Wen immediately fell into peril. He watched as the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm grabbed at his neck.</p>
<h3 id='chapter231'>Chapter 231 Fight to the Death</h3>
<p>The chick that had been standing on Zhou Wen’s shoulder suddenly spat out a golden flame that sprayed onto the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm.</p>
<p>When the golden flame touched the white-haired ghost’s palm, it was as if a spark had encountered gasoline. It immediately ignited and the ghastly hand caught fire.</p>
<p>Good bird. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he turned around and continued fleeing.</p>
<p>Although the chick was magical, it had not long been born. Its level was too low now, so no matter how powerful its flames were, it would probably not be able to burn the black-armored, white-haired ghost to death.</p>
<p>Indeed, the black gas emitted by the black-armored, white-haired ghost surged out, extinguishing the golden flames that engulfed his palm. His charred palm also rapidly recovered amidst the black gases, and his eyes showed anger as he chased again.</p>
<p>What a haunting presence! Zhou Wen suddenly felt that at times, people really couldn’t believe in superstitions. Ever since he had the Bamboo Blade, his luck had really deteriorated significantly.</p>
<p>On this return trip, a new dimensional zone had appeared out of nowhere. There were even creatures that had broken out of containment and they were unlucky enough to encounter them.</p>
<p>Truth Listener and Banana Fairy rushed over to help Zhou Wen fend off the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Zhou Wen had also pushed Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits, hoping to escape the calamity.</p>
<p>However, the black-armored, white-haired ghost had extremely high intelligence. He already knew that Truth Listener’s and Banana Fairy’s weakness was that their levels weren’t high, so he ignored them. He sent them flying and continued targeting Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept ordering Ghost Bride to fight, but all she did was tremble as she slowly floated towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Clearly, she was horrified.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dodged in the air like an eagle several times, but he failed to completely dodge the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm attacks. He was just seconds from having his neck grabbed.</p>
<p>Seeing his furious gaze, Zhou Wen had no doubt that he would snap his neck.</p>
<p>After I return, I’ll definitely stay at home and game in peace. I won’t come out again no matter what, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he prepared to activate his Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>Although the Sigh of the King was potent, his body couldn’t withstand such immense power. Furthermore, it was unknown if it was effective against the black-armored, white-haired ghost, but now, using it meant a last-ditch effort. If his attack failed, death was certain for him.</p>
<p>The white-haired ghost dodged the flames spewed out by the chick. Just as it was about to grab Zhou Wen, a bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky and struck the white-haired ghost’s head. It was Li Xuan who cleaved down with the Thundergod Sword.</p>
<p>The white-haired ghost frowned slightly. He moved his body sideways and flipped his hand, sending the ghastly gases to blast Li Xuan and his sword away.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s body slammed into the ground paved with stones, shattering the area.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan!” Zhou Wen cleaved at the white-haired ghost while shouting.</p>
<p>Li Xuan did a backflip from the rubble and charged at the white-haired ghost again, his Thundergod Sword weighing him down.</p>
<p>The white-haired ghost’s figure flashed as he grabbed the Bamboo Blade with one hand and grabbed the Thundergod Sword with the other. He violently flung Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to the ground.</p>
<p>As gravel flew, Zhou Wen felt his face deform from being smashed. It was possible that his bones were fractured as blood gushed out from his nose.</p>
<p>Li Xuan’s condition wasn’t any better as he crashed into the stony earth.</p>
<p>The white-haired ghost’s body descended and its feet were just about to step on both of their heads.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Ah Lai rushed over and kicked the white-haired ghost in the chest, sending him flying backward.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further as he channeled the Sigh of the King. Instantly, the strange power blasted out like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>A beam of light descended on Zhou Wen. Li Xuan and company couldn’t see the shadow, but Zhou Wen could sense that it was a woman, but he couldn’t see her clearly.</p>
<p>Terrifying power instantly filled Zhou Wen’s entire body, making him feel like he could blast through everything.</p>
<p>He was unwilling to waste any more time since the Sigh of the King’s power only grew stronger. If too much time passed, the power might explode his body. Zhou Wen had to finish off the Ghost King before his body crumbled.</p>
<p>Seeing the Ghost King charge at him again, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to use Transcendent Flying Immortal. His body transformed into a lightning flash as he faced the black-armored, white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade slashed at the Ghost King’s black armor once again, tearing open a deep rift. The black gas in it immediately surged out like a fountain.</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost’s expression changed. His figure flashed like a ghost and disappeared into thin air. The subsequent attacks of Transcendent Flying Immortal missed due to the target suddenly disappearing</p>
<p>When the black-armored, white-haired ghost appeared again, it was already tens of meters away. Its trajectory didn’t show, as though it had teleported over.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt the power in his body turn increasingly violent. Without any hesitation, he used Transcendent Flying Immortal again.</p>
<p>Originally, with his Primordial Energy, he could only use Transcendent Flying Immortal once before being enervated. However, with the Sigh of the King, Zhou Wen felt that he could use Transcendent Flying Immortal countless times. He didn’t need to worry about over-exerting his Primordial Energy, as though his body had infinite Primordial Energy.</p>
<p>This feeling made Zhou Wen excited and extremely worried. He was like a baby swinging a sledgehammer-he could hurt himself at any moment due to his lack of power. His body’s strength was insufficient to control the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal streaked across the sky instantly and appeared in front of the black-armored, white-haired ghost. However, his figure phased away and vanished once again. It made Zhou Wen unable to sense his aura, preventing him from locking onto it. This Transcendent Flying Immortal missed again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as his body showed signs of overexertion. If he couldn’t quickly finish off the white-haired ghost soon, he would probably implode.</p>
<p>However, the white-haired ghost possessed a technique that was similar to teleportation. No matter how strong or fast he was, it was useless if he couldn’t touch the white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>When the white-haired ghost appeared again, Li Xuan charged forward and slashed at its head with the Thundergod Sword.</p>
<p>The white-haired ghost was somewhat afraid of Zhou Wen’s strength, but he thought nothing of Li Xuan. With a slight blink, he dodged Li Xuan’s Thundergod Sword and pressed Li Xuan’s head to the ground with one hand.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Rocks flew everywhere as Li Xuan’s head crashed into a huge crater on the ground. Blood splattered out along with the rubble.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. This strike had probably crushed Li Xuan’s head.</p>
<p>However, just as the white-haired ghost was about to retract his hand, Li Xuan suddenly grabbed his arm with both hands and leaped up. He clung tightly to the white-haired ghost and shouted at Zhou Wen, “Kill him!”</p>
<h3 id='chapter232'>Chapter 232 Slaying Ghost King</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, he traversed more than ten meters in an instant and slashed his Bamboo Blade at the white-haired ghost like a bolt of lightning</p>
<p>The black gas exploded from the white-haired ghost’s body, causing Li Xuan’s blood to spray. He didn’t know how many bones had been broken, but he refused to release his tight grip.</p>
<p>Realizing that he couldn’t shake Li Xuan off, the white-haired ghost tried to teleport with Li Xuan. However, Ah Lai, who had rushed over, hugged his other leg. The ghost was clearly much slower attempting to teleport with the two of them, allowing Zhou Wen to discover the secret of his teleportation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t teleportation at all; it was just a fast-moving art, but because it was so fast, it looked like it was an instant transmission.</p>
<p>Li Xuan risked his life to hold him back, and with Ah Lai joining, his speed immediately slowed down, allowing Zhou Wen to see the white-haired ghost’s trajectory clearly.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal moved like lightning as they intertwined and slashed at the black-armored, white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>The extremely hard armor was cleaved apart by Zhou Wen’s redoubtable strength as if it was tofu as cracks appeared one after another.</p>
<p>Large amounts of black smoke spewed out from the cracks in his armor, and soon, his body appeared close to tearing apart.</p>
<p>However, a strange scene happened at that moment. The black-armored, white-haired ghost gave a long roar as it enveloped the entire land that was the nether realm. The white-robed ghosts and red-dressed female ghosts turned into streams of ghost aura that surged towards him.</p>
<p>As there were too many ghosts around him, large amounts of ghostly aura surged into his body, quickly restoring the damage to his body. The armor that was on the brink of collapse was stabilized.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this wasn’t going well. His body was almost at its limits. If this strike couldn’t kill the black-armored, white-haired ghost, he still had a high chance of killing him by using Transcendent Flying Immortal again. However, his body would probably not be able to withstand it either. He would probably implode while using Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was lamenting the turn of events, Ghost Bride beside him let out a scream as she emitted a red glow.</p>
<p>In the domain of the black-armored, white-haired ghost, her ghostly aura was also sucked away, preventing her from escaping. Finally, she unleashed all her potential.</p>
<p>Although it was said to be all her potential, there was only one talent skill that she had never used. It was also the Jinxes Husband skill that he had no idea how to use.</p>
<p>When the red glow radiated outwards, Zhou Wen and company didn’t feel anything, despite being illuminated by the red light. The black-armored, white-haired ghost was also illuminated by the red light. Immediately, the ghostly aura in his body was thrown into chaos. The ghostly aura that had been sucked into his body to heal it turned chaotic. Not only did it not repair his body, it even affected his own ghostly aura.</p>
<p>“Die!” Zhou Wen released all his strength as the remaining half of Transcendent Flying Immortal was unleashed with even more terrifying might. It transformed into bolts of lightning that meshed together, striking the black-armored, white-haired ghost.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The black-armored, white-haired ghost’s body was shattered as the black armor was scattered everywhere. The ghostly aura in his body also exploded, sending Li Xuan and Ah Lai flying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen retracted the power of Sigh of the King and landed back on the ground. He lost his balance and fell to the ground. His skin was crimson red—a result of his blood vessels and meridians bursting. Under such immense pressure, all his bones would have fractured. If he had delayed a little while longer, he would have been killed by his Life Providence without needing the black-armored, white-haired ghost to do the honors.</p>
<p>“Li Xuan, Ah Lai, are you alright?” Zhou Wen struggled to stand up, but it was to no avail no matter how hard he tried. His bones were fractured and he couldn’t stand the pain even if he didn’t move. Any movement made it excruciating</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ah Lai helped Li Xuan up from the rubble. “I’m fine. Li Xuan’s condition isn’t too good.”</p>
<p>“I won’t die.” Li Xuan was covered in bloodeven his face was indiscernible, making him look extremely terrifying. With his powerful recovery abilities, he still didn’t show any signs of improvement, proof of his serious injuries.</p>
<p>They had just said a few words when their expressions turned nasty. They were already unable to continue fighting, but the red-dressed female ghosts suddenly surrounded them. They bared their fangs and brandished their claws as if they wanted to skin them alive.</p>
<p>If this were in the past, Zhou Wen and company wouldn’t have been afraid of the red-dressed female ghosts. No matter how many of them blocked their path, they could still charge out.</p>
<p>But now, three and a half of the four were equivalent to trash. They were not combat-fit. More critically, they didn’t even have the ability to escape. They could only stand their ground and await death.</p>
<p>“I never expected that I, Li Xuan, would die in the hands of a female ghost. Alright, dying in the hands of a beautiful female ghost is better than being eaten by those ugly beasts.” Li Xuan also knew that he was unlikely to survive today, but he didn’t feel any fear. He looked up and said to Zhou Wen, “Old Zhou, I’m afraid you and I are both going to hell. When we go to hell, remember me. Don’t forget me. When the time comes, let’s wreak havoc in hell.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen also knew that there was no way they could survive this ordeal as he nodded in response.</p>
<p>Ah Lai sighed softly. “It’s a pity I still haven’t remembered what happened in the past.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yuzhi hobbled towards Zhou Wen and company with her injured legs, but she collapsed to the ground. Only Zhou Wen’s pets were still fighting, but the red-dressed female ghosts were like an unending tidal wave. With the opening the red-dressed female ghosts detected, they lunged over and threw the four into despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>A beam of light flashed as the heads of the red-dressed female ghosts flew into the air. At the same time, a figure appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>“Brother Sheng, you aren’t dead?” Li Xuan was overjoyed when he saw the person. It was An Sheng</p>
<p>However, when he saw An Sheng’s appearance, Li Xuan’s expression turned odd. He saw that An Sheng’s clothes were ironed and his shirt was clean and white. Even his hair was neat and tidy. There was no messy hair and there was a smile on his face. He did not look like he had gone through an intense battle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was clearly very strenuous for him to kill the ghosts previously, but, this time, this strike had managed to behead dozens of red-dressed female ghosts. This was clearly different from his previous performance.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’re bluffing?” Li Xuan asked with widened eyes.</p>
<p>The others looked at An Sheng as well, but An Sheng said with a smile, “Didn’t I mention that I would take you to a few dimensional zones for training? This Yin Yang Ghost World that just appeared is one of them. I originally thought that I would save you when you were on the brink of death, but I never expected that you could actually kill Ghost King. You did pretty well. Don’t you feel a sense of achievement?”</p>
<p>Li Xuan did not say a word as he showed An Sheng his middle finger. He suddenly understood why many people in Luoyang called An Sheng the Devil’s Adjutant.</p>
<p>An Sheng wasn’t angry either. He played with the dagger in his hand and casually killed the red-dressed female ghosts until they fled in fear, no longer daring to lunge forward again.</p>
<p>He walked to the spot where Ghost King had died and picked up something before stuffing it into Zhou Wen’s hand. “Young Master Wen, this is your spoils of war. It’s very meaningful. The experience gained from life and death is something that no amount of wealth can compare with.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the strength to speak. He received the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal that emitted black gas and flipped An Sheng off as well.</p>
<h3 id='chapter233'>Chapter 233 Afraid You’ll Be Unhappy</h3>
<p>I should have realized it long ago. With Ah Sheng’s meticulousness, why would he take us on such a dangerous path? Besides, he’s the one who led us here. Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. He was glad that Ah Sheng wasn’t an enemy while also warning himself.</p>
<p>This time, An Sheng was not their enemy. But if their enemy treated them this way, how would they deal with it?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only warn himself that he had to be more careful in the future.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t lose trust in anyone because of this matter. At the very least, Li Xuan and Ah Lai had chosen to fight alongside him in the life-and-death situation, instead of running for their lives.</p>
<p>Between trust and distrust, Zhou Wen knew that he needed to find a balance.</p>
<p>There was one thing An Sheng was right about. A battle that threatened his life was far more memorable than Zhou Wen gaming. Some things were difficult to understand unless it was a life-and-death situation. The penalty of death in-game ultimately failed to reach the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>On his way back, Zhou Wen was fiddling with the Ghost King’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal in his hand. An Sheng told Zhou Wen that the Yin Yang World had only appeared recently, and it was difficult to kill a Ghost King. In fact, a Ghost King was very rare as well, not something that would be encountered every time. Therefore, up to now, very few Primordial Energy Skill Crystal had dropped. The one in Zhou Wen’s hand was the first. Even An Sheng didn’t know what Primordial Energy Skill the Ghost King would drop.</p>
<p>An Sheng also said that he had watched Zhou Wen and company’s entire battle process. If it wasn’t for the strange powers of Ghost Bride restraining the Ghost King, the outcome would have been completely different. The restrictions Ghost Bride had on the Ghost King were too great. It was a very effective weapon against him.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen was interested and had the time, he could use Ghost Bride to earn money here in the future. There would definitely be people who would hire Zhou Wen’s Ghost Bride.</p>
<p>It was also An Sheng’s first time finding out the abilities of Ghost Bride. In fact, he had never seen a Ghost Bride before, and this was also his first time seeing her.</p>
<p>Not long after the Yin Yang World was discovered, all An Sheng knew about were the red-dressed female ghosts, white-robed female ghosts, and the Ghost King.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng had the ability to control dimensional creatures like ghosts. Therefore, even if two Ghost Kings appeared at the same time, he was confident that he could protect Zhou Wen and company. That was why he brought them here to experience the sensation of life and death. At the same time, he wanted Zhou Wen to experience the dimensional creatures of the ghost type. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be mentally prepared when facing them in the future.</p>
<p>What kind of Primordial Energy Skill is it? Zhou Wen didn’t directly absorb it. It was an Epic Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, so directly absorbing it was too dangerous. Zhou Wen planned on absorbing it in-game after returning to the college.</p>
<p>Nothing happened on the way back, as An Sheng successfully got them to Luoyang. When they passed by Eastern Capital, Zhang Yuzhi got out of the car and thanked them. She even added them as friends on social media.</p>
<p>“Did everything go well on the way?” An Tianzuo asked casually as he read the documents in the military camp.</p>
<p>“It went well,” An Sheng answered. “That’s good.” An Tianzuo frowned slightly as he continued reading the documents.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for a while, he still didn’t hear An Sheng speak. An Tianzuo looked up at An Sheng, who was standing by the side, and asked, “Don’t you have anything to say?”</p>
<p>“Overseer, do you want to know about my matters? Or do you want to know about Zhou Wen’s matters? If it’s the former, you can feel at ease. I was very safe the entire journey,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Humph, you are becoming more and more presumptuous.” An Tianzuo’s face sank as he reprimanded An Sheng before continuing, “I heard that he caused quite a stir in Holy City. I’m afraid he will bring trouble to our An family.”</p>
<p>“In terms of the ability to stir up trouble, he definitely can’t compare to you, Overseer. Besides, even if he were to cause trouble, the An family would be the one causing trouble for him, don’t you think so?” An Sheng blinked as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, have you been living too comfortably recently? Do you want to go on a training expedition at the front lines?” An Tianzuo put down the documents in his hand and glared at An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Overseer, calm down. I’m just afraid that you won’t be happy if I say something that I shouldn’t say,” An Sheng said meekly.</p>
<p>“I’m very unhappy right now,” said An Tianzuo with a cold expression.</p>
<p>An Sheng wasn’t afraid as he blinked and said, “Alright, I’ll tell you then. If you hear something you don’t like, don’t be angry.”</p>
<p>“Do you believe that I’ll throw you to the Chess Mountain to guard it?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“If I were to guard the mountain pass, who else would know your preferences? They wouldn’t even know what tea you like to drink or the ratio of warm water to use. I’m afraid you wouldn’t be able to get used to it.” An Sheng smiled as he made tea for An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m apprehensive about dealing with you just because of this? Do you believe that I can find a more capable adjutant to replace you tomorrow and throw you to guard the mountain pass?” With that said, An Tianzuo laughed.</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Sheng placed the teacup in front of An Tianzuo before saying seriously, “You should already know about Zhou Wen’s situation in Holy City. So what are you asking about?”</p>
<p>“Your evaluation of him.” An Tianzuo took a sip of tea and slowly said.</p>
<p>“Like I said, I was afraid you would be unhappy,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Speak.” An Tianzuo only said one word.</p>
<p>“I think he’s even stronger than you were back then,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo immediately put down his teacup and glared fiercely at An Sheng. “Don’t use those exaggerated words. No matter how well you praise him, he will not catch my eye.”</p>
<p>An Sheng said, “You said that you wouldn’t be angry. If you want to hear lies, I’ll just do as you wish. That punk Zhou Wen is extremely weak. He was capable of defeating six families and Lance not because he’s strong, but because the children of the six families are too disappointing. Zhou Wen merely enjoys undeserved fame. The reason he could kill the Ghost King is because of his sheer luck…”</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, you seem to think highly of him?” An Tianzuo narrowed his eyes and asked An Sheng</p>
<p>IZUO narro</p>
<p>“I just feel that Zhou Wen is just what Mr. Ouyang said. He’s someone that can be trusted,” An Sheng said seriously.</p>
<p>“Is that so? I don’t think so,” said An Tianzuo indifferently as he picked up the document and read it again.</p>
<p>An Sheng knew An Tianzuo’s habits, so when he saw him pick up the document, he didn’t say another word. All he could do was sigh inwardly. An Tianzuo’s temper was the same as Zhou Wen’s. It was useless for anyone to say anything once he had made up his mind.</p>
<p>Now, An Sheng only hoped that the two of them wouldn’t become enemies in the future. Otherwise, it would be a disaster.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he took the mysterious phone to snap the Ghost King’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. However, he received the notification that his stats were inadequate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a look and realized that the Ghost King Crystal was the same as the Mutated Fairy Crystal from before. They both had stat and Primordial Energy Art requirements.</p>
<p>The stat requirement was the same as Transcendent Flying Immortal-21 points of Speed. As for the Primordial Energy Art, it required Yin-type Primordial Energy Art.</p>
<p>The few Primordial Energy Arts that Zhou Wen was proficient in now were more neutral. The Ancient Imperial Sutra was clearly more inclined to Yang, and a Buddhist-type Primordial Energy Art like the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was definitely not Yin-type. As for the First Order of Chaos, it had yet to advance to the Legendary stage. The only one left was the Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have much confidence while switching his Primordial Energy Art to the Godfiend Era All he wanted to do was give it a try. After all, the Godfiend Era hadn’t appeared to be Yin-type in nature. At best, it could only be considered a little more feminine.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the mysterious phone successfully captured the Ghost King’s crystal into the game and successfully absorbed it once he switched to Godfiend Era.</p>
<p>‘Absorbed Ghost King Crystal. Attained Primordial Energy Skill: Ghost Steps.’</p>
<h3 id='chapter234'>Chapter 234 Ghost Steps</h3>
<p>Ghost Steps: A moving technique of a ghost with a mysterious, unpredictable effect.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tested Ghost Steps and discovered that it was a movement technique that resembled the Ghost King’s instant transmission. Ghost Steps wasn’t true teleportation, but an instant burst of extraordinary speed. Due to the sudden burst of speed and suddenness, it looked like one vanished.</p>
<p>Previously, with Li Xuan and Ah Lai holding back the Ghost King, Zhou Wen had seen his trajectory due to the lowering of his speed.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t true teleportation, it was already enough to pleasantly surprise him. The speed at which the Ghost Steps erupted in an instant was too astonishing. Now, Zhou Wen was only at the Legendary stage, so the speed attained from using Ghost Steps exceeded some at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>However, Ghost Steps was similar to that of Transcendent Flying Immortal. They had higher Primordial Energy requirements, so even Ghost King himself was unable to continuously use Ghost Steps. Zhou Wen was the same, although he could switch to the Dao body to increase his frequency. Typical Primordial Energy was impossible to support Ghost Steps’ consumption.</p>
<p>If I were to maintain the Sigh of the King state, with infinite Ghost Steps and Transcendent Flying Immortal, I’m afraid no one at the same level as me could withstand such terrifying attacks. What a pity. Although Zhou Wen had such thoughts, he knew that it was unlikely he could accomplish that in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhou Wen took some gifts to meet Wang Mingyuan and his seniors. He also asked Wang Mingyuan about the ivory pendant.</p>
<p>The ivory pendant emitting a chill to resist the flames of the sun in the Sun God Temple had clearly made it extraordinary.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan casually said, “That’s not ivory. It’s a type of tooth I found in Dragon’s Well. As for what kind of creature it is, it’s hard to say for now. I’ve carved a total of four pendants. One for each one of you. Consider it a memento.”</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan didn’t care about such worldly possessions. Although he knew that these teeth pendants had magical uses, he did not take them to heart.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen asked him some questions regarding combat techniques, and Wang Mingyuan answered them casually.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen consulted him on Lance’s combat tactics, Wang Mingyuan told him, “It’s not that combat tactics can’t be used, but the average person’s reaction can’t reach that level of thinking in battle. Therefore, most combat tactics are inflexible. It doesn’t change on the spot in a targeted manner. A completely inflexible combat tactic is easily seen through by others, so it has to be used appropriately unless one’s thoughts can reach the standard of a supercomputer, allowing one to react in almost every way possible. Otherwise, it can only be used as support. Don’t deliberately seek out such tactics.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t reach such a level, so he chose a more normal path, a path that could match both reality and virtuality together in a versatile manner.</p>
<p>By being versatile, faking out the enemy was a competition with the enemy on a psychological and physical level. Although this gave the enemy some time to think, he too would have the time to think and see who was better.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen learned from Wang Mingyuan. Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan were in the lab every day while Hui Haifeng often went out. He was considered the most active one of Wang Mingyuan’s disciples.</p>
<p>The more Zhou Wen learned from Wang Mingyuan, the more he found Wang Mingyuan’s knowledge unfathomably deep. Furthermore, he had a mild personality and wouldn’t force him to learn anything, nor would he assign him to take a particular path. He was like a lamp that illuminated the world ahead of him. As for the path an individual wanted to take, they could choose it themselves.</p>
<p>The sun was scorching, and the familiar cries of cicadas made the summer feel even hotter.</p>
<p>It was rare for Wang Mingyuan to take the four of them to a classroom. He borrowed a projector and explained some relatively advanced theoretical knowledge and equipment to Zhou Wen and company.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan was not only a researcher of dimensional forces, but he was also very accomplished in science.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too interested in technology, so he sat quietly at the back and played games.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng listened attentively, but it wasn’t clear if he was really interested or had other plans.</p>
<p>Zhong Ziya was lying on the table sleeping, but the cicadas’ chirping irritated him so much that he couldn’t fall asleep no matter what. He lay there weakly, his eyes staring blankly at the blackboard.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan supported his face with one hand and looked out of the window, as if he was looking at the cicadas on the tree outside and with great interest.</p>
<p>Wang Fei walked to the door and peeked inside the classroom through the gap. She wanted to know how Zhou Wen’s progress under Wang Mingyuan’s teachings.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, she couldn’t help but feel a little depressed. She thought to herself, Uncle Mingyuan’s personality is just too nice. He spoiled these guys. How can he let them off like this?</p>
<p>Although she had such thoughts, Wang Fei didn’t enter the room to say anything. Firstly, this was Wang Mingyuan’s class, so she had to respect him. Secondly, Wang Fei knew that reprimanding a person like Zhou Wen was useless.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wang Fei had also heard what Zhou Wen had done in Holy City. Although the six families had started a news lockdown, the news couldn’t be kept under wraps forever.</p>
<p>Wang Fei was Ouyang Lan’s best friend. She had long known from Ouyang Lan, and the tone she used to flaunt him made Wang Fei feel contempt.</p>
<p>Forget it. It’s already very difficult for this fellow to find an opponent among his peers. It’s unlikely that I can come up with very good ideas to encourage him to continue working hard for the time being. I’ll let him be smug for now. After some thought, Wang Fei decided to ignore Zhou Wen for the time being. After all, Zhou Wen was only a first-year freshman. Compared to the other students, Zhou Wen’s improvement was extremely fast.</p>
<p>However, after Wang Fei returned, she still raised the difficulty of her homework missions. This led her students crying foul.</p>
<p>The students never expected that their homework missions became harder because of Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Wang Lu walked out of the building with the baby tiger and, when she saw Zhou Wen return after class, she went forward to greet him. “Zhou Wen, are you interested in heading to Dragon Gate Grotto to hunt dimensional creatures?”</p>
<p>“I’m actually caught up with something. I’m afraid I don’t have time,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“What else do you do? Isn’t it just gaming?” Wang Lu curled her lips, displeased with Zhou Wen’s perfunctory answer.</p>
<p>“That’s right. There’s a part of the game I can’t get past. I wish to make a breakthrough as soon as possible,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>
<p>With Ghost Steps and Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen planned on attempting to kill the Golden Flying Ant again or see what was inside the white cocoon.</p>
<p>He had not been able to raise his Primordial Energy and Constitution to 21 all this time, so all he could do was place his target on something tangible first.</p>
<p>“Gaming nerd.” Wang Lu puffed up her cheeks and left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen returned to his room and switched on his phone. He chose to enter the Ant Nest and headed straight for Ant City.</p>
<h3 id='chapter235'>Chapter 235 Setting Up a Stall</h3>
<p>When the blood-colored avatar arrived in Ant City again, it no longer acted as cowardly as before. Zhou Wen’s pets could easily resolve the ant horde without him needing to do anything</p>
<p>After clearing all the ordinary ants, Zhou Wen took his pet to the ant nest at the apex.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant charged straight out. Its speed was extremely fast, even faster than the Ghost King when not using Ghost Steps. Its feet shot out a terrifying golden beam like a blade.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had allowed the Saber Shield Knight to lead the charge, using his shield to block the golden beam. However, he could only block once. Although he had used a shield Primordial Energy Skill, the shield cracked from the strikes. If another blow landed, the shield would definitely be destroyed.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant attacked from the side but was instantly killed by the beam shot from the Golden Flying Ant’s eyes. Its wings and body were penetrated.</p>
<p>Truth Listener attacked from the flank but was taken down by the golden beam. Immediately, it retreated with a tragic cry.</p>
<p>Its stats couldn’t resist the Golden Flying Ant’s strength. It was not as powerful as when it faced the Ghost King. Even its fur revealed a wound.</p>
<p>However, this was already considered very strong. Ordinary Legendary creatures would have been killed instantly.</p>
<p>With the banana fan in hand, Zhou Wen fanned at the Golden Flying Ant and instantly sent it flying backward.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, Zhou Wen used the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and charged towards the white cocoon. It was still difficult for him to kill the Golden Flying Ant alone, so he decided to first see what was inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant’s speed was extremely fast as it instantly charged back. A golden beam shot out of its eyes, trying to kill Zhou Wen on the spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stepped on the nest’s wall and suddenly vanished, leaving the Golden Flying Ant stunned.</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen appeared again, he was already in front of the white cocoon. His palm struck the white cocoon in a bid to blast it apart.</p>
<p>However, the strike that was powered by Golden Palm made Zhou Wen feel as though his palm had struck a spring. After the cocoon slightly caved in, it immediately bounced up, sending Zhou Wen flying.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant flashed over to him and the blood-colored avatar that was sent flying back was instantly killed by the golden beam. The game screen turned black.</p>
<p>My full-strength strike failed to deal any damage to the white cocoon? Zhou Wen was slightly surprised as his curiosity towards the white cocoon increased.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way to bring the Bamboo Blade in-game. Otherwise, it would be much easier to use Bamboo Blade in-game to split open the cocoon. Zhou Wen wanted to try it again, but the antelope was displeased. It ran over and bit Zhou Wen’s clothes as it pulled him out.</p>
<p>“Alright, I got it.” Zhou Wen helplessly put away his cell phone and took the antelope out to eat.</p>
<p>During the period Zhou Wen wasn’t around, he had requested Wang Lu to take care of the antelope. Zhou Wen had originally planned on getting Wang Lu to give it some fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>However, who knew that after Zhou Wen returned, this fellow insisted on heading to the school’s cafeteria to eat steak every day.</p>
<p>You are an antelope. You eat grass, alright? Zhou Wen cursed inwardly as he felt a little depressed. He could have just fed it some vegetables without spending much money like in the beginning, but after Wang Lu’s feeding for a few days, the fellow insisted on eating steak daily. If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s robbery of many Companion Eggs on his trip and his plans on selling them for a good price, it was unlikely that he could afford to rear it.</p>
<p>It’s true that one is marked by the company one keeps. I definitely can’t let my pets have anything to do with Wang Lu in the future. Zhou Wen subconsciously touched the chick on his shoulder.</p>
<p>After the meal, Zhou Wen planned on selling all the Companion Eggs he had on hand. The money he obtained could be invested in Huang Ji’s game. It wasn’t likely to be a problem to sell so many Companion Eggs for one or two million. He definitely would have some money for the investment.</p>
<p>There was a trading market in the school, so students could purchase or sell the Companion Eggs they obtained there. Zhou Wen scanned the Companion Eggs he had obtained with his mysterious phone and after seeing their types and attributes, he labeled them. Each Companion Egg was labeled with its species and price and nothing else. Zhou Wen began setting up a stall for the first time.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the market, the place was bleak. There was almost no one there, other than two people.</p>
<p>As most of the students were at the Mortal stage, they were unable to use Legendary Companion Eggs. Furthermore, Mortal Companion Eggs were extremely rare. Therefore, typical students would never come here. Those who came were basically the top students of the school.</p>
<p>Typically, students who could advance to the Legendary stage by now were students with good family backgrounds. They didn’t usually lack Companion Eggs, so they wouldn’t go through the trouble of selling the Companion Eggs they obtained.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen looked at the empty market and began suspecting if his Companion Eggs could be sold.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this Zhou Wen? Are you here to buy a Companion Egg? Come and see my Companion Eggs. They are all excellent-grade…” After the only two stall owners in the market saw Zhou Wen, one of them, a senior named Li Yu, immediately had his eyes light up as though he was a wolf seeing its prey. He nearly pounced at him.</p>
<p>The other person who had set up a stall was actually Huang Ji.</p>
<p>“Senior, why are you setting up a stall here?” Zhou Wen asked Huang Ji.</p>
<p>“My lack of money. What else can it be?” Huang Ji said embarrassedly.</p>
<p>“By the way, Senior, didn’t you say you were going to the Holy Land? Why didn’t I see you?” Zhou Wen recalled how Huang Ji had mentioned that he was going to the Holy Land, but when Zhou Wen was there, he didn’t manage to see Huang Ji, despite especially looking out for him.</p>
<p>“You didn’t see me, but I saw you. You were impressive.” Huang Ji gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“I was compelled. Did you obtain anything from your trip to the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I did gain something. I obtained a God Power Crystal, but that item can’t be exchanged for money, so I’m still short of cash,” Huang Ji said as he sized up Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “You seem to have obtained quite a number of Companion Eggs in the Holy Land. You should be able to sell them for quite a bit, right? Do you plan on investing in my game?”</p>
<p>“Once I sell them for money, I’ll immediately invest in your game,” Zhou Wen said with certainty.</p>
<p>However, he was somewhat puzzled. Huang Ji had actually said that he had obtained a God Power Crystal and knew that Zhou Wen had robbed many Companion Eggs. That meant that he had likely gone to the Holy Land, but Zhou Wen was puzzled why he hadn’t seen him.</p>
<p>“Then what are you waiting for? Hurry up and set up the stall.” Huang Ji’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen set up the stall beside Huang Ji, but other than the three of them sitting in a row, there was no one to be seen.</p>
<p>The trio looked at each other without saying a word.</p>
<p>Having nothing to do, Li Yu was given a fright when he saw the four Companion Eggs Zhou Wen had placed out for sale. “Zhou Wen, isn’t your label fake? Isn’t a Companion Beast like the Broken-Winged Angel something only found in the West district? Also, this Cyclops Behemoth is unique to the West District, isn’t it? This Ice Frost Bear is something from the North district, right? We don’t typically get to see any of this over here.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter236'>Chapter 236 Selling on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Companion Eggs Zhou Wen had snatched were Legendary Companion Eggs which were specially prepared for sale by the various major merchants. Most of them were unique to certain regions and were very few in number. They were considered rather rare types that were scattered all across the globe.</p>
<p>Even if one went to a large Companion Egg store in Holy City, it would be very difficult to see so many different types from so many different regions.</p>
<p>“You’ll know if it’s true if you buy one,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, but isn’t your price too high?” Li Yu glanced at Zhou Wen’s bid. The Broken-Winged Angel was worth 188,000. Typical Legendary Companion Eggs could be bought at 10–20,000. The rare ones went for about 70-80,000. Only excellent-grade Eggs could exceed 100,000.</p>
<p>“I referenced the price on the Internet. It’s non-negotiable,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>He had checked the prices on the Internet, but due to the frequent appearance of dimensional zones across the world, traffic was greatly obstructed. The supply chain had become slow and unsafe, and there were often severe losses of goods. Therefore, the scale of Internet transactions was gradually shrinking</p>
<p>If he couldn’t sell it in the college, Zhou Wen could only try his luck at Luoyang’s market. If he still couldn’t get a buyer, he could only sell it to merchants. If that happened, the price would be very low.</p>
<p>Li Yu smacked his lips. “Zhou Wen, I don’t have the money to buy such things. However, if you try here, I’m afraid you won’t be able to sell it either. Why don’t we do it this way? Why don’t you hand over your Companion Eggs to me for selling. I’ll take a ten percent commission for my hard work?”</p>
<p>“Why will you be able to sell it if I can’t sell it here?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Yu with interest.</p>
<p>Li Yu handed a business card to Zhou Wen. “To be honest, I’ve already been accepted by the Royal Pet Store. Although I haven’t graduated yet, I’m already an official employee there. As you can see, there’s no one here. I’m only setting up a stall here due to the company’s requirements. If your Companion Eggs are real, I can help you sell them through the company’s channels. The prices will definitely be high, on the premise that these Companion Eggs are definitely real.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people didn’t know of the battle in the Holy Land, nor did they know what Zhou Wen had done in Holy City. Otherwise, Li Yu wouldn’t have suspected the authenticity of these Companion Eggs.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ll just sell them by myself. After all, I have nothing to do.” Zhou Wen knew that Li Yu was planning on doing a lossless business. The risk was all Zhou Wen’s, but the profits had to be shared with Li Yu. Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know how much Li Yu would sell them for.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen knew that the fellow wasn’t reliable based on the name of the Royal Pet Store. Together with three other pet stores, it was known as one of the top four scammers in the League. They were well-known to purchase at low prices and sell at high prices, and they liked to play cheap tricks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t too busy himself. He could game while running a stall, so there was no rush.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this. Since it’s not easy to sell these Companion Eggs, why don’t you sell them to me as a package deal? As long as you can guarantee their authenticity, I’ll give you 80,000 each. Four of them makes it 320,000. Let’s round it off to 300,000. How about that?” Li Yu added.</p>
<p>“Non-negotiable,” Zhou Wen said as he gamed.</p>
<p>“This Ice Frost Bear is clearly too expensive. An ordinary Ice Frost Bear Companion Egg is only 70-80,000. Why are you pricing it at nearly 200,000?” Li Yu pointed at the Frost Bear Companion Egg.</p>
<p>“It’s worth every penny.” Zhou Wen’s Ice Frost Bear was indeed priced very high, but that was because he had seen its stats and knew that it was worth the price.</p>
<p>“If you do business like this, you won’t even be able to sell it in the Luoyang market, much less here.” Li Yu had never seen Zhou Wen’s sales tactics before. He decided to wait and see; he believed he could buy Zhou Wen’s Companion Eggs at low prices after Zhou Wen realized the cruel reality of the world.</p>
<p>There were very few people in the market. Occasionally, students would come for Li Yu. From the looks of it, his identity as a Royal Pet Store employee wasn’t fake. Occasionally, the student council would entrust him to sell the Companion Eggs they obtained from the dimensional zone.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t offer a high price, the benefit was that money could be directly received without going through the trouble of selling it themselves.</p>
<p>However, the ones that were sold to Li Yu were mostly common Companion Eggs that were nothing spectacular.</p>
<p>“How about it? Did you see that? The students acknowledge me. The price is fair and honest. The price I gave you isn’t low.” Li Yu took another Companion Egg and flaunted it at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him as he continued gaming. By the side, Huang Ji was also doing something on his laptop. His fingers were rapidly tapping on the keyboard, having no time to chat with Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen was ignoring him, Li Yu couldn’t help but mumble, “That’s not the way to do business. You definitely won’t make any sales.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, another person walked over. When Li Yu saw that person, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian, you got another Companion Egg?” Li Yu hurriedly went forward to welcome him warmly.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard Gu Dian’s name, he looked up and indeed saw the devilish-looking man walk in.</p>
<p>“How much can these Companion Eggs be exchanged for?” Gu Dian threw a bag in front of Li Yu.</p>
<p>Li Yu hurriedly opened the bag and was overjoyed when he saw more than ten Companion Eggs inside. As he appraised them, he said in delight, “This should be a Golden Warrior Companion Egg. Others will pay at most 5,000 to buy them out. On account of us being old friends, I’ll give you 5,500 for it…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Eggs with his cell phone and couldn’t help but be astonished. Li Yu was indeed quite capable. His appraisal of the Companion Egg’s species was right on the money.</p>
<p>However, the price he offered was nothing but a scam. It was basically less than a third of the market price.</p>
<p>A Golden Warrior Companion Egg might only be an ordinary Legendary, but it was an excellent pet for tanking. They were sold for rather high prices on the market. However, the price Li Yu offered was much lower than that of a typical Legendary Companion Egg. He was truly unscrupulous.</p>
<p>“Gu Dian, are you selling these Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Dian.</p>
<p>Gu Dian was ultimately a member of the Xuanwen Club despite only being recruited to make up the numbers. Zhou Wen didn’t wish for him to be cheated right under his nose.</p>
<p>A person like Gu Dian spent all day in the dimensional zones without even having a friend. He definitely wouldn’t know the market prices, so Zhou Wen reckoned that he had been scammed by Li Yu in the past.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Gu Dian.</p>
<p>“Since I’m also selling Companion Eggs, I’ll sell it for you if you trust me,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Gu Dian grabbed his bag and placed it in front of Zhou Wen before turning to leave without a word.</p>
<p>Li Yu was somewhat infuriated as he said to Zhou Wen with a cold expression, “Zhou Wen, that’s quite an a**hole thing to do. Don’t you know the rules of doing business?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about business, but Gu Dian is a member of our club. I’m not breaking the rules by helping him sell them, right?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let me watch you sell them here.” Li Yu was in no hurry. He had to sell the Companion Eggs through the Royal Pet Store’s channels. It was practically impossible to sell them here.</p>
<h3 id='chapter237'>Chapter 237 Rich</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored Li Yu and wrote the name and price on Gu Dian’s Companion Eggs before sitting behind his stall to continue gaming.</p>
<p>Li Yu glanced at Zhou Wen’s prices, one of the eggs was extremely expensive.</p>
<p>How dare you price a Gatekeeper Lion Companion Egg at 100,000? It’s ridiculously high even for a retail price. It will be a miracle if you can sell it, thought Li Yu.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about it, another person came to the market. This time, it was a young student who looked extremely handsome, like a movie star.</p>
<p>When Li Yu saw this person, his eyes lit up as he went forward again. “Brother Luo Xuan, are you here to buy Companion Eggs? I recently obtained quite a number of good items…”</p>
<p>Luo Xuan went over to Li Yu’s stall to take a look at the Companion Eggs, but when he saw Zhou Wen’s stall, he couldn’t help but take a look. He was immediately interested.</p>
<p>“I’ll take all four of them,” Luo Xuan said as he pointed at the four Companion Eggs Zhou Wen had placed for sale.</p>
<p>“Brother Luo, don’t just look at the name. How high are the chances of us obtaining a Companion Egg like the Broken-Winged Angel or the Ice Frost Bear?” Although Li Yu didn’t say that Zhou Wen’s Companion Eggs were fake, it was obvious from his tone.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan smiled and said, “A person like Zhou Wen wouldn’t lie on such matters.”</p>
<p>“Even if they’re not fake, aren’t they too expensive? If you really want them, I’ll get the company to transfer some over for you in a few days. The Ice Frost Bear is at most 100,000.” Zhou Wen had ruined his business plans, so Li Yu didn’t want Zhou Wen to have an easy life.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan smiled at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou Wen, can your Companion Eggs be cheaper?”</p>
<p>“No, they’re worth every penny. You can buy them for 100,000 elsewhere, but that’s the price for mine,” Zhou Wen said without looking up.</p>
<p>“Brother Luo, look at his attitude. He’s clearly trying to scam you,” Li Yu said.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan thought nothing of it as he directly transferred the money to Zhou Wen. “Alright, I’ll take all four of them. Help me wrap them up.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I forgot to bring any bags. You’ll have to hold them yourself.” After receiving the payment, Zhou Wen realized that he didn’t even have a plastic bag.</p>
<p>Li Yu’s face turned livid as he watched from the side. He thought to himself, Luo Xuan sure is silly and rich. He’s buying those things just like that? This is really letting Zhou Wen luck out.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan didn’t mind. He opened his backpack and stuffed the four Companion Eggs inside. Then, he looked at the Companion Eggs placed on Zhou Wen’s counter and asked in surprise, “Why is this Gatekeeper Lion Companion Egg so expensive? The market price should be around 20,000, right?”</p>
<p>“This is a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion egg. It’s no ordinary Gatekeeper Lion,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Mutated Gatekeeper Lion?” Li Yu was slightly taken aback as he carefully looked at the Companion Egg, but he failed to notice anything amiss. It was identical to an ordinary Gatekeeper Lion egg. He couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. It’s true that Zhou Wen is very talented, and I admit that I’m inferior to you, but when it comes to the appraisal of Companion Eggs, it’s my specialty. What I studied for three years wasn’t for nothing. Even I can’t tell the difference, but you can? What a joke.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve heard of a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion. What difference does it have from ordinary ones?” Luo Xuan’s interest was piqued.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen said, “Mutated Gatekeeper Lions are quite rare. It’s normal that you haven’t heard of them. They have higher stats than the typical Gatekeeper Lion, and they have an additional Lion Roar as a skill. It’s a relatively rare sonar wave attack. Just having this technique alone makes it worth more than 100,000.”</p>
<p>“I never knew that. I’ll buy it.” Luo Xuan said extravagantly as he waved his hand, wanting to transfer the money.</p>
<p>“Brother Luo, I’ve heard of Mutated Gatekeeper Lions, but they are very rarely produced. None of us have seen them before. However, I’ve heard that not every Mutated Gatekeeper Lion has Lion Roar so it’s still probabilistic. Without the ability of a Lion Roar, there’s almost no difference between a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion and a normal one. No one knows if it’s really mutated.” Li Yu was speaking the truth, but he was also suspecting that Zhou Wen was selling an ordinary Gatekeeper Lion as a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan looked at Zhou Wen who said indifferently, “I can only guarantee that this is a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion egg. I can’t guarantee anything else.”</p>
<p>When Li Yu heard Zhou Wen say that, he immediately beamed with joy. Only a fool would buy something like that with you saying that.</p>
<p>“I’ll buy it.” However, Luo Xuan waved his hand, causing Li Yu to be dumbfounded. His mouth was agape for a long time.</p>
<p>He knew that Luo Xuan was rich, but he never expected him to be so rich. He was secretly depressed. If I had known that Luo Xuan was such a fool, I would have asked for higher prices in the past.</p>
<p>Seeing that Luo Xuan no longer had any interest in the other Companion Eggs on Zhou Wen’s counter, Li Yu hurriedly took out the few valuable Companion Eggs he had. Although they couldn’t compare to Zhou Wen’s Ice Frost Bear and the rest, they were rare ones produced at the college.</p>
<p>“Brother Luo, this is a rare White-Winged Red-Tail Crane. Its skill is extremely rare and it is very rarely produced. I was lucky to acquire one. I spent 98,000 on it. For you, I’ll charge you 110,000.” After witnessing Luo Xuan’s wealth, Li Yu automatically increased the price to a whole new level.</p>
<p>“Yes, not bad.” Luo Xuan nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you like it, Brother. Do you want to pay by card or bank transfer?” Li Yu was secretly delighted.</p>
<p>“I only brought so much money today. It’s all spent. Perhaps next time,” said Luo Xuan with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Yu was somewhat dumbfounded. He felt depressed. D*mn it, you can just swipe your card and not use your wallet. What do you mean by not bringing that much money today?</p>
<p>Luo Xuan ignored Li Yu and took out the Mutated Gatekeeper Lion egg. He directly injected his Primordial Energy and hatched it.</p>
<p>When Li Yu saw Luo Xuan doing so, he couldn’t help but nod inwardly. From the looks of it, Luo Xuan isn’t really silly. By hatching the Gatekeeper Lion on the spot, he will definitely settle scores with Zhou Wen once he discovers that he has been fooled. Zhou Wen can’t deny it even if he wants to.</p>
<p>Li Yu folded his arms and waited for the development to play out. Gu Dian was the one who had brought the Gatekeeper Lion egg here. Even Gu Dian himself didn’t mention anything about a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion and Li Yu couldn’t tell; therefore, he refused to believe that Zhou Wen would be able to recognize a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion. He believed that Zhou Wen was likely deliberately scamming Luo Xuan in a bid to earn more.</p>
<p>Soon, Luo Xuan hatched the Gatekeeper Lion. A majestic stone lion appeared in front of him. Li Yu took a look and saw that it looked identical to an ordinary Gatekeeper Lion. It looked nothing like a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion.</p>
<p>Just as he was waiting to see Luo Xuan and Zhou Wen fall out, he suddenly heard Luo Xuan say, “It’s indeed a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion. Apart from its Speed, all its attributes are no less than 17. Lion Roar is indeed excellent. Zhou Wen, if you have such good stuff in the future, contact me directly.”</p>
<p>Li Yu felt as if he was dreaming as he watched with his mouth agape as Luo Xuan and Zhou Wen added each other as friends.</p>
<h3 id='chapter238'>Chapter 238 Ever-Victorious</h3>
<p>“To be honest, my family owns a pet store, but it naturally can’t compare to a chain store like Royal Pet Store that covers the entire League. Our store is a small shop in Luoyang. In the future, if a Companion Egg is sold or if you want to buy a Companion Egg, you can look for me directly.” Luo Xuan sent Zhou Wen a message.</p>
<p>“I still have some rare Legendary Companion Eggs that are about the same as those four rare ones. What kind of prices would you pay for them?” Zhou Wen replied to Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>The two exchanged a few words with information and after confirming the price, Zhou Wen immediately packed up and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>The price Luo Xuan offered was rather fair and was close to the true value; therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste time here. He planned on selling Gu Dian’s and his Companion Eggs to Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to pack up and leave, Li Yu called out to him.</p>
<p>He turned to look at Li Yu. Li Yu hesitated for a moment before saying, “How could you tell that it was a Mutated Gatekeeper Lion?”</p>
<p>“Is that very difficult?” Zhou Wen asked in return before bidding farewell to Huang Ji. He carried the bag half-filled with Companion Eggs and left the market.</p>
<p>Li Yu was stunned for a while before he came back to his senses. He couldn’t help but smile bitterly and say, “If that isn’t considered difficult, then what’s the point of me studying for three years?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen arrived at the spot he had agreed on with Luo Xuan and gave Gu Dian and his Companion Eggs to him. And without any bargaining, Luo Xuan transferred the money to Zhou Wen at the agreed price.</p>
<p>Ignoring Gu Dian’s portion, Zhou Wen had obtained more than two million. This was the first time he had received so much money. He felt like a nouveau riche.</p>
<p>“Are you interested in becoming an appraiser at my pet store after graduation? I can give you some shares,” said Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in the appraising business.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment before asking, “Do you have any Legendary weapon-type Companion Beasts? The ones with extremely powerful destructive power, it’s best if their destructive power can reach the Epic stage.”</p>
<p>“If someone were to ask that, I would definitely say no. In fact, I would even look down on him. However, since that’s what you asked, I’ll tell you that they exist, but they are very expensive,” said Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>“How expensive?” Zhou Wen was in desperate need of a weapon that could break through the white cocoon.</p>
<p>The power of the banana fan was the wind. If it evolved to its limits, it could blow an entire mountain away.</p>
<p>However, its power was not concentrated enough and its destructive power wasn’t potent enough. This was incomparable to a single-target skill. If one wanted to destroy something, heavy weapons were more practical. At the very least, they needed to be weapons like swords and sabers.</p>
<p>Luo Xuan muttered to himself, “I wonder if you have heard of a Companion Beast like Overlord Snake? It’s a very rare Companion Beast and it has immense strength. It can be considered a top Strength-type Companion Beast at the Legendary stage. Its companion form is a spear, and we give it a nicknameOverlord Spear.”</p>
<p>After pausing for a moment, Luo Xuan continued, “The Overlord Spear is considered top-notch among Legendary weapons. However, if it’s compared to an Epic-stage weapon, it’s definitely far inferior. However, there are always exceptions. Just like the best offensive pet, Thundergod General, if it possesses the ability of Thundergod Augmentation, the lightning power it produces will be able to stand head and shoulders above its peers. It’s the same with Overlord Snake. The typical Overlord Snake isn’t strong, but if you have a Mutated Overlord Snake, there is a possibility of it having the talent skill—Ever-Victorious. With this skill, Overlord Spear will be able to penetrate most objects. Even the typical Epic creature can’t withstand its sharpness.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity that Mutated Overlord Snakes are very rare, and the Mutated Overlord Snakes with Ever-Victorious are even rarer. Our family had hired people to grind in the Snake Cavern for six months before we obtained an Overlord Snake with Ever-Victorious. And that’s under the circumstances of having excellent luck. Now, that Mutated Overlord Snake is one of our store’s crown jewels. It’s not for sale, but if you want it, I can make the decision to sell it to you. But I must warn you, it’s very expensive.”</p>
<p>“How much is it?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“10 million.” Luo Xuan named the price.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed very expensive. I can’t afford it.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing we can do about it. An Overlord Snake’s level isn’t considered high, but it’s very rare for it to have Ever-Victorious. Furthermore, we got someone to specially incubate it. If you want it, the person needs to sacrifice his own cultivation level and damage his body to transfer Overlord Snake. That will require a huge sum of money as well,” said Luo Xuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. Everyone wanted the good stuff. Although their levels were about the same, the high price was understandable.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t afford Overlord Snake, but Luo Xuan’s words reminded him that even though he couldn’t afford it, he could try to grind one at Snake Cavern.</p>
<p>Snake Cavern was near Old Dragon Cave. Zhou Wen had heard Zhong Ziya mention it before, but he hadn’t paid much attention to it back then. Besides, Zhong Ziya didn’t know that Mutated Overlord Snake had the Ever-Victorious skill.</p>
<p>After separating from Luo Xuan, Zhou Wen transferred Gu Dian’s money to him. Zhou Wen had already added him as a friend when he entered the Xuanwen Club.</p>
<p>After Gu Dian received the money, he only replied with two words: “Got it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen contacted Huang Ji again and confirmed some matters regarding the game. In the end, he confirmed his investment of 1.5 million. This investment was split into two tranches. The initial investment was 500,000. After Huang Ji completed a demo, he would fund him with the remaining 1,000,000 investment.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and went to Snake Cavern. There were python-like snakes everywhere. Legendary Overlord Snakes had peerless strength and were considered top-notch Legendary creatures. Furthermore, they lived in groups with numerous numbers. Typical Legendary students wouldn’t dare enter Snake Cavern.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms. He summoned his group of Companion Beasts and wreaked havoc in Snake Cavern.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen understood why Overlord Snakes were so expensive. He had killed nearly a hundred of them, but not a single Overlord Snake egg dropped, much less a mutated one.</p>
<p>In the next few days, other than studying at Wang Mingyuan’s place, Zhou Wen spent the rest of his time grinding the Overlord Snakes. However, he had nothing to show for. Over the past few days, he had only obtained an ordinary Overlord Snake egg. He managed to encounter a Mutated Overlord Snake, but nothing dropped.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Luo Xuan said that they were extremely lucky to have a Mutated Overlord Snake egg drop after six months. Zhou Wen thought of the matter of luck and thought of Wang Lu.</p>
<p>With Wang Lu’s luck, if she were to be taken to the Snake Cavern, she might be able to have a Mutated Overlord Snake egg drop. However, Zhou Wen had no intention of seeking help, so all he could do was continue grinding. After repeatedly grinding, Zhou Wen nearly vomited when he saw the snake.</p>
<p>Ding! Zhou Wen killed another Mutated Overlord Snake. Suddenly, he heard a crisp sound as a black snake egg dropped and landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Mutated Overlord Snake egg! Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly got the blood-colored avatar to pick it up. Then, he prayed inwardly, Please let it have the Ever-Victorious skill. If I keep grinding, I’ll go hissterical!</p>
<h3 id='chapter239'>Chapter 239 Sky Spider</h3>
<p>Mutated Overlord Snake: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Born Overlord</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 16</p>
<p>Constitution: 18</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 15</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death Coil</p>
<p>Companion Form: Spear</p>
<p>It doesn’t have Ever-Victorious! Zhou Wen was very disappointed. Although the Mutated Overlord Snake’s stats were not bad, it was useless without the Ever-Victorious skill.</p>
<p>After putting away the Mutated Overlord Snake, Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue grinding at Snake Cavern. He had to get the Mutated Overlord Snake with Ever-Victorious to drop no matter what.</p>
<p>Boom! As Zhou Wen was grinding the Overlord Snake, he suddenly felt his house shake violently as though an earthquake was happening</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly exited the game and rushed out of the building to see what was happening</p>
<p>By the time he rushed out, An Jing and Wang Lu were already standing in the yard. Furthermore, the two of them were looking up into the sky as though they were looking at something</p>
<p>Wasn’t it an earthquake? Why are they looking up at the sky? Zhou Wen also looked up at the sky and was alarmed by what he saw.</p>
<p>Up above, there were crystalline silk criss-crossed like a huge net that covered the entire sky. Perhaps not just Sunset College, but all of Luoyang.</p>
<p>And on the net, there was a spider with eight eyes that resembled jade. It kept spewing out spiderwebs.</p>
<p>A break-out creature? Zhou Wen was alarmed.</p>
<p>The spider was so huge that the web it spewed out nearly covered the whole of Luoyang. Just its aura alone meant that its level was definitely not low.</p>
<p>At this moment, an attack aircraft appeared in the sky and launched an assault on the spider and spiderweb. However, the web moved and wrapped around the attack aircraft. The attack aircraft immediately stuck to the web and exploded very quickly.</p>
<p>The flames created by the explosion failed to destroy the spider’s web.</p>
<p>The bullets and shells fired by the plane were also stuck to the spiderweb, making them seem completely useless.</p>
<p>The spider in the sky let out a silent roar, but Truth Listener’s ability allowed Zhou Wen to hear the strange shriek.</p>
<p>Then, many ventilation holes in the spider’s abdomen opened up. When they opened and closed, white spheres were spat out which landed in various locations.</p>
<p>Two of them landed in the direction of Sunset College. Zhou Wen focused his gaze and only when the sphere was close did he realize that it wasn’t a sphere. Instead, there were countless white spiders entangled together, making them look like a sphere.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to land on the ground, the sphere exploded, causing a sea of spiders to land everywhere in Sunset College. Instantly, the entire school was filled with spiders.</p>
<p>“All teachers and students, may I have your attention. Please eradicate the invading spiders. This is not a drill… I repeat, this is not a drill…” The school’s announcement system urgently sounded.</p>
<p>Epic-stage counselors had already streaked across the air, killing many spiders that had yet to land.</p>
<p>However, there were too many spiders and there were still many that landed throughout the school.</p>
<p>Quite a number of spiders had fallen into Four Seasons Garden. There was one not far from Zhou Wen and company, the spider was snow-white in color and its hair was white. Its claws looked like translucent jade, and it was bigger than a human, but it didn’t look terrifying. Instead, it looked like a furry toy.</p>
<p>An Jing and Wang Lu were still sizing up the spider out of curiosity when Zhou Wen summoned the Overlord Snake and thrust forward with Penetrating Pierce.</p>
<p>After the battle in the Yin Yang world, Zhou Wen was instinctively wary of dimensional creatures. Regardless of their looks, he had to first ensure that he wasn’t being threatened.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Penetrating Pierce only managed to cover half the distance when the spider spat out a strand of web that wrapped around the Overlord Spear. Then, with a flick of its head, Zhou Wen felt a powerful force surge towards him, making him feel like he couldn’t hold the spear.</p>
<p>He hurriedly tightened his grip on his spear as the man and spider were locked in a stalemate. Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to pull the spider over.</p>
<p>INTO</p>
<p>An Jing quietly summoned a long sword that dazzled with divine light. She then slashed at the spider.</p>
<p>The spider spat out another strand of silk. When the sharp sword beam touched the silk, it ended up stuck as well. It left the three of them shocked.</p>
<p>To have a power that allowed a spiderweb silk to cling to a sword beam was somewhat terrifying</p>
<p>The crux of the matter was that Zhou Wen and company didn’t know if the spider was a dimensional creature or a puppet summoned by the spider in the sky. They felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>The spider’s mouth kept spewing webs, trying to immobilize the trio. Soon, the webs covered a large area.</p>
<p>Wang Lu summoned a whip, but just as she lashed it out, it was stuck in the spider’s web. She couldn’t pull it back no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>In the sky, an Epic expert had already flown over on a flying bird. He slashed a stunning sword beam at the spider, but despite having the power to slice through a mountain, it ended up stuck to the spider’s web the moment it made contact with it. It was unable to move forward, and vanished without a trace moments later.</p>
<p>After the spider’s silk bound the flying bird, it strangled the bird into two like blade-like steel silk.</p>
<p>There were already five Epic experts from the military, but despite using all sorts of abilities, they were unable to do anything to the huge spider in the sky.</p>
<p>From time to time, it would spit out spider spheres that scattered across the city, causing the entire city to fall into a panic.</p>
<p>Wang Lu and An Jing were also attempting to fight the spider but to no avail. Their attacks were blocked by spiderwebs, making it impossible to pose a threat to the spider.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen snapped a picture of the spider with his phone, hoping to see if he could obtain its information so as to find a way to kill it.</p>
<p>However, the information he obtained left him somewhat disappointed. The information only mentioned that it was a Sky Spider puppet, so it didn’t look like a dimensional creature, but a puppet formed from the spider’s powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the banana fan and fanned a Grand Yin Wind at the spider. The cold wind tore through the spiderweb and swept it over the spider’s body. Instantly, the spider flew up and slammed into a tiny building in front, causing the walls to crack.</p>
<p>An icy glint flashed in An Jing’s eyes as she grabbed the opportunity to pierce the spider’s body with her sword beam.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The spider’s body exploded and it immediately perished.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, your fan is very useful. Let’s quickly finish off the other spiders to prevent the other students from being harmed,” Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen, overjoyed.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t as optimistic as Wang Lu. The number of spiders that came raining down was just too many. It was already difficult for them to deal with them, so how would ordinary citizens cope? It was likely that Luoyang City was already facing an apocalyptic scene.</p>
<p>Before the trio could rush out of Four Seasons Garden, they saw other special admissions students battling the spiders. They weren’t much different from Zhou Wen and company. The attacks were of little use against the spider puppets, so it was extremely difficult to fight them.</p>
<h3 id='chapter240'>Chapter 240 Chaos of the Sky Spider</h3>
<p>None of the special admissions students of Sunset College were weak. Although they were unable to kill the spider, they still used various methods and abilities to deal with the spider. They were not in danger at all.</p>
<p>However, with the increasing number of spiderwebs surrounding them, the amount of space they and their Companion Beasts could move in became restricted. The battle became somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>Four or five spiders spewed out spider silk in Four Seasons Garden. Bright, crystalline spiderwebs could be seen everywhere. A Companion Beast had already been stuck to one, preventing it from struggling.</p>
<p>Having already discovered the spider’s weakness from her previous battle, An Jing stabbed forward like a bolt of lightning, instantly pinning a spider to the ground.</p>
<p>This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen An Jing fight seriously. Her swordplay was extremely intense, and each strike carried a dazzling glow, as though the void had been penetrated as well.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately recognized the Primordial Energy Art that An Jing used. It was no doubt the Sun Strafe Art. Her sword techniques were somewhat extraordinary and although they looked simple, each strike made them look extremely gorgeous. The sword flashes were like dazzling divine beams.</p>
<p>She was so powerful that she looked as good as Lance. It was just that she and Lance used two completely different styles.</p>
<p>Lance’s technique was unparalleled, but An Jing’s every strike was like a bolt of lightning. If she could kill her opponent with one strike, she definitely wouldn’t require a second attack.</p>
<p>I deserved losing back then. With An Jing’s strength, Zhou Wen was indeed no match for her back then.</p>
<p>Seeing that An Jing could deal with the spiders in Four Seasons Garden, Zhou Wen immediately rushed out and saw that there were indeed spiders spewing out spider silk outside. A student was stuck to the spiderweb as the spider crawled towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen raised his left hand and chopped down with Astral Slash Blade. The blade aura transformed into thin threads that sliced through the spiderweb. The remnant forces continued on and sliced the spider into two.</p>
<p>The schoolmate was still in shock. Before he could thank him, Zhou Wen had already rushed elsewhere.</p>
<p>There were many experts on campus. Besides the Epic counselors, there were also quite a number of students who could kill the spiders. The spiders in the school were quickly subdued.</p>
<p>“All students, may I have your attention… All students who have the ability to kill spiders… please enter the city immediately to aid the military… This is not a drill… I repeat, this is not a drill… All students who participate in the hunting of spiders will be rewarded with credits…” The broadcast rang again.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhou Wen had already run to the school’s entrance and ridden the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant out of the school.</p>
<p>The situation in the city was indeed much worse than the school. From afar, Zhou Wen could see the intertwined spiderwebs in the middle of buildings. The city looked like a spider forest with webs everywhere.</p>
<p>Many citizens had already been stuck to the spiderwebs. Quite a number of people had already been killed. The military were firing with their assault rifles in all directions. However, the effects looked limited. It was only possible for them to kill a spider after several consecutive shots hit the target.</p>
<p>Moreover, the spiders moved very agilely and they were protected by the webs. When a bullet hit the web, it was stuck and had its effects limited.</p>
<p>A mother carrying a child was bound by a spiderweb and was left hanging in the air, suspended in the middle of the building. They were just seconds from having the spider pounce at them.</p>
<p>The eyes of the soldiers below were bloodshot, but they didn’t dare fire. It was too close to the mother and son. If they shot, they might accidentally hit the innocent.</p>
<p>Just as the spider was about to bite the mother and son, a figure flashed across the sky. The spiderweb and the spider were split into two. The duo who fell were grabbed by the figure before landing safely on the ground.</p>
<p>The soldiers came over to rescue the mother and son, leading them to seek refuge. A soldier asked Zhou Wen, “Are you a student at Sunset College?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Please provide assistance to the Duke of Zhou Temple. That area has become a spider disaster zone and is spreading outwards,” the soldier said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhou Wen replied before riding the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant towards the Duke of Zhou Temple.</p>
<p>The person that worshiped at Duke of Zhou Temple was Ji Dan. He was King Wu of Zhou’s younger brother, had been regent twice, and helped King Wu of Zhou in clinching victory at the Battle of Muye. He was also involved in the establishment of rites and the creation of music, earning him a consecration from future descendants.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stormed through and killed several spiders on the way and rescued some citizens.</p>
<p>However, along the way, many citizens had already turned into corpses. They looked as if they had been sucked dry as they hung on a spider web attached to skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Just one break-out creature can cause such a disaster. If the various dimensional zones are unable to trap those dimensional creatures, what will the world become? Zhou Wen felt that his strength was minute.</p>
<p>The battle in the sky continued as a few Epic stage experts rushed over. In the sky, they were fighting the Sky Spider, but the situation didn’t look good. No one could pose a threat to the Sky Spiders. Instead, their Companion Beasts were stuck to the spiderwebs. No matter how much they struggled, they were unable to escape.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you going to the Duke of Zhou Temple as well?” Zhong Ziya charged over from another direction and happened to meet Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The thin sword in his hand was unbelievably fast. Wherever the sword passed, the spiders would have their foreheads instantly penetrated by a sword beam, leaving only a wound that resembled a needle hole, accentuating their deaths.</p>
<p>“There was a soldier who said that it needs reinforcements,” Zhou Wen said as he tore open the spider webs.</p>
<p>“Me too. Let’s go together.” Zhong Ziya rushed over with his sword in hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen followed. Soon, he met a few other students who had been invited by the military to reinforce the Duke of Zhou Temple.</p>
<p>The military’s Epic powerhouses were rushing into the sky to fight the Sky Spider. If they didn’t get rid of the Sky Spider as quickly as possible, the spiders that it spat out would be endless. All they could do was leave the spiders below to ordinary soldiers and some Legendary military officers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and the other students from Sunset College would become officers if they chose to join the army after graduation. There was no need for them to start off as enlistees.</p>
<p>Usually, when the students were together, it was difficult to tell who was truly strong, but when it came to real battles, everything became obvious. Zhou Wen had never seen some of the powerful students in the school rankings before.</p>
<p>A person like Zhong Ziya was definitely not weaker than Wei Ge, the president of the student council. He could even be stronger; however, he didn’t have a ranking.</p>
<p>The pair of siblings from the Wu family were terrifying as well. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel at how many hidden dragons and crouching tigers there were at Sunset College.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to arrive at Duke of Zhou Temple, Zhou Wen saw Hui Haifeng leading a group of people in a battle with the spiders. The surrounding soldiers were also watching the front lines as they fired crazily.</p>
<p>They had yet to see the Duke of Zhou Temple, but the number of spiders ahead of them was uncountable. It was unknown how many of them were crawling out.</p>
<p>“This city has become a spider’s nest,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Hurry up and provide reinforcements. We can’t hold out any longer!” Hui Haifeng shouted.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, Zhong Ziya, and the rest of the students rushed forward and blocked the swarm of spiders. It was a chaotic scene where they killed countless spiders. Yet, the number of spiders that charged out from the Duke of Zhou Temple remained constant.</p>
<h3 id='chapter241'>Chapter 241 Entering the Temple</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen rushed in front of a military officer and asked, “How long have you been here? How many spider balls have landed here?”</p>
<p>“We’ve been here for nearly an hour. We saw a total of three spider balls landing near the Duke of Zhou Temple,” the officer answered.</p>
<p>“The three spider balls can’t have that many spiders. Have you sent someone to charge in to take a look?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>As the officer fired, he shouted, “We also suspect that there’s something wrong inside, but there are too many spiders. We can’t charge in. We’ve tried, but suffered heavy casualties.”</p>
<p>“There’s no point in this endless killing. Zhou Wen and Ziya, charge in with me to take a look,” Hui Haifeng said as he charged towards the group of spiders with his shield.</p>
<p>His charge was extremely ferocious, but he was quickly stuck by a spiderweb and could no longer break through.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Zhong Ziya charged over and sliced the spiderweb in front of them with their saber and sword.</p>
<p>There were a few students standing behind them. They huddled into a group as they charged in, fighting ceaselessly against the tidal wave of spiders.</p>
<p>A few drops of blood landed on Zhou Wen’s face. They were from Hui Haifeng. A strand of spider silk had swept across his face, leaving a bloody mark.</p>
<p>The temple was in front of them, but they couldn’t see the main body of the temple at all. It was completely covered by the spiderwebs as if it was covered in snow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company could see large numbers of spiders crawling out of the spiderwebs without stopping.</p>
<p>“There must be something wrong with the temple. Otherwise, how can there be so many spiders crawling out from such a tiny place?” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“The webs have sealed off the area. If we head in, just making contact with a few spiderwebs will trap us. When that happens, we won’t even have a chance to hide,” a student said.</p>
<p>“Let us rush in and take a look. Help us watch our backs.” Two military officers rushed into the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company tried their best to block the surrounding spiders as the two officers entered one after another. Not long after they entered, they heard a scream as another officer flew out.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Zhou Wen caught the officer and asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“There are too many webs in there. There’s no room for movement at all. You’ll get stuck with any slight movement. The third platoon commander…” The officer’s eyes were red and he couldn’t continue speaking. He got up and wanted to rush towards the temple again.</p>
<p>“Don’t go, it’s useless even if you go. The spiderwebs are like a lair. Anyone who goes in will die unless it’s an Epic expert who forcefully tears through those webs.” Zhong Ziya held the officer down and prevented him from entering</p>
<p>“If we don’t resolve the problem here, the spiders will rush out like a tidal wave. There’s no way we can defend our ground. When the time comes, the entire Luoyang City will be finished.” The red-eyed officer struggled out of Zhong Ziya’s grasp as he tried to charge inside.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. They naturally knew that it was impossible for such a small group of people to fend off so many spiders unless an Epic expert came.</p>
<p>But right now, the Epic experts were attacking the Sky Spider, so how could they come here to support them?</p>
<p>“I hate these fellows who risk their lives for no good reason. It’s as if everything can be resolved as long as they are willing to risk their lives.” Zhong Ziya pursed his lips disdainfully and continued, “Please help me watch the area outside. I’ll go in and take a look.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Zhong Ziya raised his sword and leaped over the officer, before entering the opening. “Ziya, I’ll go in with you.” Hui Haifeng pushed away the spider in front of him and entered the lair-like temple.Read more chapter on vipnovel.com</p>
<p>“Stay outside for now. Before we come out, you must hold the ground no matter what. Don’t let the spider swarm spread out,” Zhou Wen said to the officer as he rushed into the temple.</p>
<p>The spiderweb wrapped around the doors and walls like yarn. Mere contact would cause the spider silk to cling onto them like death’s grip. When the time came, they wouldn’t be able to break free, making dodging the spiders’ attack extremely difficult. They would then be like a fly caught in a spider’s web.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen rushed in, he saw that the ground was covered in spiderwebs and that if his feet were to touch the ground, he would likely be stuck to it.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t flustered. He circulated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and slashed out with his Primordial Energy. Immediately, he tore open the spiderweb in front of him and his legs landed on the ground. The moment his feet touched the spider silk, it immediately melted like snow meeting embers. It failed to stick to Zhou Wen’s body.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen was outside, he had already tried all sorts of Primordial Energy Arts and discovered that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was highly effective against spider silk. When they encountered the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Primordial Energy, they would immediately melt. This was why he dared to barge in.</p>
<p>He hadn’t gone far before he saw Hui Haifeng’s body covered with spiderwebs. He resembled a dumpling wrapped in white silk. However, he could still charge forward. The nearby spiders who had crawled out failed to hurt him due to the spider silk that formed a protective net.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen scrutinized Hui Haifeng and realized that the spider silk on him had clearly been put on by him. It wasn’t connected to the spider silk outside. Although he looked terrifying, he was still able to move freely.</p>
<p>“That’s a good move. How did you think of that?” Zhou Wen charged over and rendezvoused with Hui Haifeng, killing all the incoming spiders.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng said, “These spider silk threads look scary, but if you take a closer look, you’ll see that there are actually two types. One is a sticky kind of spider silk, the other is a type that doesn’t stick. Those spiders are also walking on the non-sticky spider silk, so I used those as a form of protection. The non-stick spider silk helps against the other kind of spider silk, so it prevents me from being stuck.”</p>
<p>With that said, Hui Haifeng sized up Zhou Wen from head to toe. “Dude, how did you get in? You weren’t stuck by the spider webs?”</p>
<p>“My strength perfectly counters these spider silk threads. They can’t stick to me.” Zhou Wen asked again, “Where’s Ziya?”</p>
<p>“He rushed to the front. He’s too fast and I can’t catch up with him. I reckon he should already be in the main hall of the Temple by now,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Then take your time. I’ll head in and take a look as well.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he used his Bamboo Blade to storm open a bloody path and charged into the Duke of Zhou Temple.</p>
<p>“Wait for me.” Hui Haifeng rushed in with Zhou Wen. However, because he was covered in spider webs that made him look like a snowman, his actions appeared somewhat clumsy.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Blade was extremely sharp, and with Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Primordial Energy, it was the nemesis of the spiders. Wherever the blade passed, the spiderwebs and spiders were sliced apart.</p>
<p>The two of them charged forward and killed countless spiders.</p>
<p>An intense battle sounded in front of him as Zhou Wen hurriedly called out to Ziya. He immediately heard Zhong Ziya’s voice: “I’m here. Quick, help me. This fellow is a tough one.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter242'>Chapter 242 The Team for Putting Out Fires</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen heard the sound coming from the backyard, but it was already covered in beads of silk, like a snow cave.</p>
<p>Truth Listener’s ability allowed Zhou Wen to see what was happening inside. Zhong Ziya was fighting a group of spiders, and in the yard, there was something like a well. Spiders were pouring out of it and, clearly, that was the problem.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right there.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he circled around to the backyard. Indeed, he saw Zhong Ziya embroiled in a battle with a horde of spiders.</p>
<p>He didn’t have any spiderwebs on him, and his powers were clearly unable to restrain the spider silk like Zhou Wen’s. However, his movement technique was extremely odd. He was like a boneless snake as he swam through the silk, preventing it from sticking to him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took a closer look and realized that when Zhong Ziya’s body touched a strand of silk, he would land on the non-sticky spider silk. The spiders could do nothing about him.</p>
<p>However, Zhong Ziya wasn’t in the best of conditions. Although normal spiders couldn’t do anything to him, there was a very strange spider that left him in peril.</p>
<p>The spider was also snow-white in color, but on its back was a unique blood-red pattern. The pattern looked like a human face, making it stand out among a group of snow-white spiders.</p>
<p>The blood-patterned spider kept darting through the horde of spiders to avoid being attacked by Zhong Ziya. Zhong Ziya had been pursuing it the entire time, but there was something that left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>When the blood-patterned spider burrowed into the pile of spiders, Zhong Ziya would lose his target. When he saw it again, he failed to recognize it immediately.</p>
<p>“Ziya, what’s the situation now?” Hui Haifeng noticed something amiss as well and hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“That spider is the problem. Quickly kill it,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“I see, but why does it look like you don’t want to kill it?” Hui Haifeng said as he rushed over.</p>
<p>“If I could recognize it, I would have killed it long ago. It’s very cunning. It’s always burrowing into the spider horde and mixing with other spiders. It takes me a while to determine which one it is,” Zhong Ziya said.</p>
<p>“It can’t be, can’t you see the blood-colored patterns on its back?” Hui Haifeng asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“I’m colorblind, and particularly can’t identify red.” Zhong Ziya’s answer nearly caused Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng’s jaws to drop to the ground. If it weren’t for this critical moment, they would never have believed that such a strange illness existed in this world.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng charged forward and punched the blood-patterned spider. It moved at rapid speed, allowing it to easily dodge Hui Haifeng’s attack. Speed wasn’t Hui Haifeng’s forte to begin with, so now that he was wrapped in spider silk, he became even clumsier. He ultimately failed to catch up to the blood-patterned spider, but he did kill several ordinary spiders.</p>
<p>Without another word, Zhou Wen used Ghost Steps and charged forward as though he had teleported. The Bamboo Blade cleaved the blood-patterned spider into two.</p>
<p>Unlike the other spiders, once the blood-patterned spider died, it didn’t reduce to dust. It was actually a true body of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He thought that all the spiders were puppets, but this one was clearly not.</p>
<p>The moment the blood-patterned spider died, the underground well exploded and large amounts of white liquid spewed out. After that, no spiders crawled out.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and company had slaughtered all the spiders, he walked to the well and saw that it was only a few meters deep. It resembled a huge pot, so he couldn’t work out how that many spiders managed to crawl out of it.</p>
<p>The military was firing wildly outside and killing the spiders that crawled out earlier. However, the effects were getting worse. Quite a number of soldiers were hung up by the spider silk and some of them even had their bodies snapped into two by it.</p>
<p>Despite almost failing to hold the defensive line, the significant drop in spiders that crawled out of the temple allowed them to gradually stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>“They succeeded!” The officer in charge was surprised and delighted. He ordered the soldiers to increase their firepower and quickly eliminate all the spiders.</p>
<p>By the time Zhou Wen and company came out, most of the spiders outside had already been killed by the troops and other students who had rushed over to reinforce them.</p>
<p>“Students, thank you for everything you’ve done…” The officer was about to say something when he suddenly received an urgent notification. There was another spot in the city where another spider horde had gathered. The troops there were asking for reinforcements.</p>
<p>“Students, if it’s possible, can I ask you to come with us?” the officer said in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“How troublesome. Where is it?” Zhong Ziya asked.</p>
<p>Hence, Zhou Wen and company became an emergency team that was made to put out fires. They constantly shuttled through the city, in charge of clearing locations that constantly produced spiders.</p>
<p>There were more than ten places like this in Luoyang City. And these were the discovered ones. It was unknown how many in the suburbs had yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>The three of them should have split up and gone to different locations, but Hui Haifeng couldn’t catch up with the blood-patterned spider and Zhong Ziya was colorblind, so they had no choice but to rush over together.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the two of them opening up a path, all Zhou Wen needed to do was focus on killing the blood-patterned spider. The effects had increased significantly.</p>
<p>After killing a few blood-patterned spiders, Zhou Wen discovered a Companion Egg inside a blood-patterned spider’s body. Zhou Wen glanced at it with his mysterious phone.</p>
<p>Sky Spider Larva: Legendary (Youngling)</p>
<p>Life Providence: Son of the Sky</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 20</p>
<p>Constitution: 17</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 20</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Sky Spider Silk, Sky Spider Sanguine Venom.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sky Spider Glove</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew what was going on when he saw the annotation of a youngling. Typical Companion Beasts didn’t have any room for growth. Legendaries were Legendaries; impossible for them to further evolve.</p>
<p>However, with the youngling annotation, it meant that there was still room for growth. As for the level of advancement after becoming an adult, that depended on its bloodline.</p>
<p>Since it was a youngling of a Sky Spider, it would probably grow into existence like the Sky Spider in the sky.</p>
<p>The three of them continuously moved to help the military kill the Sky Spider younglings. Many officers recognized them, but they didn’t know their names.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company had killed another Sky Spider youngling and were rushing to the next location when they suddenly saw the sky light up.</p>
<p>It was daytime with the blazing sun high in the sky, but the radiance was even more dazzling than the sun.</p>
<p>The trio couldn’t help but look up. They saw a brilliant sword flash sweep across the sky, as though it had swept across the entire horizon. The gigantic Sky Spider was instantly killed.</p>
<p>The Sky Spider had been sliced in half and fell from the sky. It was unknown where it landed, but it caused the entire city to experience tremors for a moment like an earthquake.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked up into the sky. At the spot where the sword beam disappeared, a man in an officer’s uniform and trench coat stood in midair like a god of war.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo? Although he couldn’t see An Tianzuo’s face due to the distance, the latter’s figure immediately made him recall An Tianzuo.</p>
<h3 id='chapter243'>Chapter 243 Deserving of a Commendation</h3>
<p>The calamity of the Sky Spider was finally over. The damaged city could be repaired, but the dead would never come back to life.</p>
<p>“Bury our brothers who died properly. Arrange to disburse the bereavement money as quickly as possible. Make sure that not a single cent goes astray. Also, if they have any problems at home, do your best to take care of them. We can’t let their family cry while our brothers are bleeding.” An Tianzuo sat behind his desk as he looked at the list of casualties An Sheng had brought over. His expression wasn’t the best.</p>
<p>He had said that he wanted to protect Luoyang, but today, Luoyang City nearly became a ruin.</p>
<p>“Everything has been arranged. Do you want to attend their funeral personally?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Tianzuo nodded with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“Also, this is the list of those who contributed from below. Most of them are fine, but since many students from Sunset College had participated in the battle, our subordinates have also submitted their names. Three of them were personally added by Deputy Governor Qin, but…” An Sheng paused for a moment.</p>
<p>“But what?” An Tianzuo asked.</p>
<p>“Those three students didn’t report to the military headquarters for registration, so they don’t know their names. Deputy Governor Qin only mentioned three students, but didn’t write their names,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Since they didn’t head for the military headquarters, it means that they don’t care about the rewards. They likely come from the big and powerful families. It’s fine if they didn’t register, but why would Uncle Qin especially highlight them? There should be some reason for this, right?” An Tianzuo said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Overseer, you’re wise. These three students helped our troops destroy sixteen spider wells, significantly reducing our casualties. The officers below wish to report their names, but they don’t know them. Deputy Governor Qin especially highlighted them after learning of the matter. I believe he hopes we can find out who they are and give them the commendations that they deserve,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many youths these days who are so responsible. Such acts are indeed worthy of commendation. Find them and hold a commendation ceremony at Sunset College. I want to personally award them a reward and set them as a classic example.” An Tianzuo nodded slightly when he heard that.</p>
<p>“Yes, Overseer,” An Sheng replied. He took note of this matter and went to settle it after he was done with his other more pressing issues.</p>
<p>The two clearly didn’t realize that Zhou Wen was one of the three. This was because, from their understanding of him, Zhou Wen was clearly not someone who was willing to take risks.</p>
<p>To be able to do such a thing as venturing deep into the spider’s lair was definitely an action a hot-blooded youth would take. And Zhou Wen’s character was clearly not one.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, the shocking sword beam from An Tianzuo still appeared in his mind from time to time.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I’m still very far from An Tianzuo. It’s no wonder Lance said that he wants to advance to the peak of the Epic stage before challenging An Tianzuo. That does make sense. Zhou Wen also hoped that he could reach that level one day.</p>
<p>Of course, thinking about it was useless. Therefore, Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and planned on continuing to enter the game to hunt monsters so that he could quickly increase his strength.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen could enter the instance dungeon, the antelope came over to tug at his clothes. Zhou Wen knew that it wanted to eat again, so he took out the soy sauce beef he had placed in the chaos space.</p>
<p>When he picked up the soy sauce beef, Zhou Wen saw a necklace beside it. Only then did he recall that he had snatched the necklace from John.</p>
<p>John was immune to the Grand Yin Wind from Banana Fairy because he was wearing the necklace. Although it was because the level of the Banana Fairy was still low, it was undeniable that the power of the necklace gave him a strong resistance against the wind element.</p>
<p>However, Luoyang basically didn’t have any wind-elemental dimensional creatures. It hadn’t come in handy after Zhou Wen had received the necklace.</p>
<p>He took it out and saw that the gems embedded in it seemed to have a swirling vortex within. It was rather magical.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy, who was flying around on a banana leaf, flew over when she saw the Goddess of Wind’s protection. She landed on Zhou Wen’s hand that was holding the necklace. She looked pitifully at Zhou Wen with her large eyes, her mouth producing a voice that Zhou Wen couldn’t understand. It was unknown what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>“You want this necklace?” Zhou Wen asked Banana Fairy.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy hurriedly nodded as she looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.</p>
<p>“What do you want it for? You can’t wear such a huge necklace. You can’t treat it like a snack, right?” Zhou Wen casually asked.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen finished his sentence, Banana Fairy grabbed the gem on the necklace and bit down. The stone that seemed to have wind flowing within was devoured by her.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey… I was just making a remark… Why did you really eat it…” Zhou Wen’s heart ached. This item was a treasure that could make him immune to wind-based attacks. Zhou Wen was prepared to take it to Sky City.</p>
<p>Sky City was mostly filled with wind-elemental creatures. With this necklace, Zhou Wen could kill dimensional creatures there without any worries.</p>
<p>Now that Banana Fairy had swallowed the gem, he didn’t know if the necklace had any effect.</p>
<p>However, the Banana Fairy looked at Zhou Wen with a puzzled expression. She didn’t quite understand why Zhou Wen was acting so sad even though he was the one who had asked her to eat it.</p>
<p>However, this expression didn’t last long. After swallowing the gem, wisps of wind gushed out from Banana Fairy’s body. The wind turned into something visible to the naked eye as it spun around Banana Fairy and the banana leaf. Furthermore, the wind was getting stronger and stronger as it gradually formed a storm.</p>
<p>The tables and chairs in the room were all swept up. If this continued, the entire building would probably be swept up by her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly stowed away Banana Fairy into the chaos space as he wondered in surprise, Could it be that Banana Fairy is going to evolve? She’s already at the Legendary stage. If she continues to evolve, wouldn’t she be at the Epic stage?</p>
<p>The hurricane in the chaos space continued as Zhou Wen’s consciousness entered. All he saw was a heavenly pillar-like hurricane swirling, preventing him from seeing Banana Fairy’s figure.</p>
<p>The storm was getting more intense, and it didn’t seem like it would stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>Seeing the mess in the room, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shake his head slightly. He began packing up the items on the ground and just as he was done packing, he heard his cell phone ring.</p>
<p>“Little Wen, let me ask you something. Did my father ever give you anything special?” Ouyang Lan’s voice came through the phone.</p>
<p>“I used to eat at the former principal’s place often, but it seems like he never gave me anything. Sis Lan, has something happened?” Zhou Wen noticed that Ouyang Lan’s tone was somewhat odd.</p>
<p>“We’ve established contact with the expedition team and they said that they lost contact with my father. I plan on making a trip to Zhuolu myself to figure out the situation. During my absence, you have to take good care of yourself. If there’s anything you need, find An Sheng. He will help you,” Ouyang Lan said a few simple words and hung up before Zhou Wen could ask about the situation.</p>
<h3 id='chapter244'>Chapter 244 Movement Technique</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly called back, wanting to meet Ouyang Lan and tell her about the name card and number. However, it wasn’t convenient to call her over the phone. It could be troublesome if the call was monitored.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen called, he heard the notification that the person he had just called had switched off their phone.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment before calling An Sheng. Thankfully, An Sheng’s call went through successfully.</p>
<p>“An Sheng, I called Sis Lan just now. Why is her phone switched off?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Madam has already set off. She left in a hurry, so she didn’t take any detours. She’s flying straight to Zhuolu County. On the way, she will pass through many areas with abnormal magnetic fields. It’ll probably be very difficult to contact her on her phone,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>What happened? Why did Sis Lan leave in such a hurry? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“We aren’t sure of the actual situation. All we know now is that one of the people who went to the dimensional zone for research with Mr. Ouyang has returned. He said that some accidents happened in the dimensional zones. They were separated from Mr. Ouyang, and many of them died. Only he escaped alive. Later, they sent a few more groups of people in, but the outcome was terriblemany people died. Madam was really worried, so she went alone. Overseer couldn’t stop her, so he rushed people over. You don’t have to be worried.”</p>
<p>“An Sheng, can you take me along? I also want to go to Zhuolu,” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people in this world who didn’t ask for anything in return. The former principal was one of them. Although Zhou Wen was a rather cold and aloof person, he wished to do something for the former principal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that he was lacking, so it was useless entering the dimensional zone. However, he had the mysterious phone. If he could find the tiny palm symbol there, he could explore the dimensional zone in the game’s instance dungeon and learn of the dangers ahead of time. It might be of help to the former principal.</p>
<p>“That ancient battlefield is extremely terrifying. Previously, those who entered with the principal were all experts at the Epic stage. Even so, only one of them survived. It’s useless for the average person to go. Don’t worry, we will do our best to save Old Mr Ouyang,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel at ease staying here either. I wish to wait at Zhuolu so that I can immediately learn the latest news about the former principal and Sis Lan,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>An Sheng hesitated for a moment before saying, “The first group of people has already set off for Zhuolur. I’m afraid we won’t be able to catch up. Wait another two days first. The people that Overseer has hired will arrive then. When the time comes, you can follow them.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen had no other choice but to agree.</p>
<p>This world is changing too quickly, but my growth in strength is just too slow. Zhou Wen recently had an increasing feeling that his improvement was too slow.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t realize that typical college students who advanced to the Legendary stage before they graduated from university were considered fast growers. He had already advanced to the Legendary stage in his first year of university, so he was indeed a little too impatient at wanting to advance to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Even with a background like the six families, with virtually unlimited resources supporting them, it would be difficult for students to advance to the Epic stage in just a few years.</p>
<p>I wish to slowly advance too, but this world isn’t waiting for anyone. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>He went to the Golden Flying Ant once again. This time, Zhou Wen used Ghost Bride, hoping to use her ability to be immune to physical attacks. He wanted to see if she could pass through the white cocoon to see what was inside them.</p>
<p>When he arrived, Ghost Bride was actually able to ignore the Golden Flying Ant’s attack. This delighted Zhou Wen greatly, but just as she was about to pass through the white cocoon, she was repelled by the cocoon.</p>
<p>Is it still impossible? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. All he could do was continue grinding Overlord Snakes, hoping that he could get one with Overlord Spear as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, can you do me a favor?” Hui Haifeng suddenly asked while he was studying at Wang Mingyuan’s place.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Can you practice movement techniques with me? In the past, I’ve been too focused on strength and techniques, but I neglected my movement techniques. When we went to kill the spider, Ziya and you showed me the importance of movement techniques. I want to practice them, but it’s not an ordinary technique. I developed a technique that’s most suitable for me, so I need someone to help me,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“I can do it in the next two days. However, I might have something to attend to in two days and have to leave the school,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“It should be done in two days. I don’t have any clue, so I need to find a direction in actual combat. It shouldn’t take too long,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s begin now,” Zhou Wen agreed.</p>
<p>When he got to the training field with Hui Haifeng, Hui Haifeng had Zhou Wen attack him with all his might, but all he did was block or dodge.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng was rather well-rounded. He was a person with a relatively balanced development, but in terms of movement techniques, he was weaker than Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits and constantly attacked Hui Haifeng.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng seemed to have learned a few movement techniques that constantly swapped. Yet, he was still constantly struck by Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, Hui Haifeng had improved very quickly. After familiarizing himself with Zhou Wen’s movement techniques, the number of times he was hit began to decrease.</p>
<p>The progress was extremely smooth, but after reaching a certain level, Hui Haifeng could no longer dodge Zhou Wen’s attacks. No matter how hard he tried, there was no progress.</p>
<p>“The pressure on me isn’t enough. Faster,” Hui Haifeng said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen switched to Godfiend Era and used his levitation ability to push his Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to an even higher level. He flew across the sky and attacked Hui Haifeng from all directions, making it even harder for Hui Haifeng to dodge. The number of times he was hit increased.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng gritted his teeth as he constantly changed his movement techniques. The number of palm imprints on his body increased, but he had no intention of giving up. He continued to persist, hoping to find a path that was most suitable for him to break through while under heavy pressure.</p>
<p>It’s useless… It’s still useless… My speed isn’t as fast as Zhou Wen’s… Nor do I have such powerful aerial combat capabilities as Zhou Wen… What can I do? Hui Haifeng didn’t feel vexed over his flaws. Instead, he was searching for a chance to resolve the problem with his own abilities.</p>
<p>Under Zhou Wen’s relentless assault, Hui Haifeng gradually found a path that belonged to him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hui Haifeng seemed to come to a realization. His movement technique changed drastically, one completely different from the movement technique he had used earlier. It was quite a bizarre change.</p>
<p>Rather than saying that it was a movement technique, it was more accurate to say that it was a variation in the footwork in a fist technique. Hui Haifeng’s movements were very tiny, but such tiny movements were very fast like an explosive impulse.</p>
<p>This kind of movement couldn’t be maintained at high speeds, but the continuous impulse movement caused Hui Haifeng’s trajectory to become unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id='chapter245'>Chapter 245 Movement Technique (2)</h3>
<p>“Haha, I’ve finally found a suitable movement technique for myself. No matter how fast I am, I can’t compare to you and Ziya. I can’t maintain a high speed like the two of you, but I can use my explosive impulse to accelerate myself to a speed faster than the two of you for a moment. And I have good endurance and can sustain such continuous impulses. This is the most suitable movement technique for me.” Hui Haifeng laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed a pretty good movement technique,” Zhou Wen praised.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng wrapped his arm around Zhou Wen’s shoulder and said, “This movement technique was completed with your help. Half the credit goes to you. I’ll give you half of the naming rights. You and I can think of one word and we’ll use it as the name of this movement technique. In the future, when it becomes famous, your name will definitely be recorded in history.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’m just a sparring partner,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>
<p>“It’s different. My movement technique was inspired by your movement technique. Half its name has to come from you. Come, quickly think of a name for it. I can’t wait to perfect it.” Hui Haifeng took out a piece of paper and a pen and handed them to Zhou Wen. He asked him to have a think before he wrote a single word.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen found Hui Haifeng’s method of naming rather ridiculous, he thought for a moment under Hui Haifeng’s insistence and wrote the word “True” on the piece of paper.</p>
<p>After the two of them finished writing, they unfolded the pieces of paper together and saw that there was also the word “True” on Hui Haifeng’s paper. When they saw the words on the paper, they couldn’t help but be slightly stunned.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng laughed. “It looks like we’re both like-minded and thought of the same thing. Let’s do it this way. It won’t be interesting to write another name. This movement technique shall be called Double True.”</p>
<p>“Double True… Double True… True Double… This name sounds a little…” Zhou Wen repeated it a few times before he realized[1] that something was amiss.</p>
<p>After Hui Haifeng said it out loud, he clearly realized this problem. However, he didn’t mind it and said with a smile, “Double True movement technique doesn’t sound nice, but since it’s decided by fate, let’s call it Double True.”</p>
<p>With that said, Hui Haifeng ran off. He couldn’t wait to head back and continue researching and perfecting the Double True movement technique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Wang Mingyuan’s disciples are all talented geniuses, but their personalities are weird. I originally thought Hui Haifeng was a normal person, but from the looks of it, he isn’t very normal.”</p>
<p>An Sheng needed to do a lot of work. Not only was he An Tianzuo’s adjutant, but he was also the An family’s butler. He had to handle the matters of the military and the An family. Therefore, An Sheng had to organize people to handle many matters.</p>
<p>When he received a name list, his expression turned extremely odd.</p>
<p>There were three names written on the listone of them was Zhou Wen. These three names were specially written by Qin Wufu. An Tianzuo had also mentioned that he wanted to personally reward the three.</p>
<p>None of that was a problem, but one of the three names was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this list is correct?” An Sheng looked at the intelligence officer in front of him and asked. He had to be sure of this matter, or else there would be a huge problem.</p>
<p>“Yes, many officers have seen the three of them before. We have also checked the surveillance footage of some shops nearby and compared them to the school’s database. We have confirmed that it’s the three of them. Furthermore, we have also brought a photo to show those officers. It’s confirmed without a doubt that it’s the three of them,” the intelligence officer said with certainty.</p>
<p>“Very good. You did well. Go ahead and busy yourself.” An Sheng looked at the name on the list and a strange smile appeared on his lips. He took some documents and got up to head to An Tianzuo’s office.</p>
<p>“Come in.” An Tianzuo was handling some documents, clearly in a bad mood.</p>
<p>He already had a headache over the various break-out creatures from the dimensional zones. Now that Ouyang Lan had gone to such a dangerous place, he was very worried.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because there were too many problems in Luoyang and he couldn’t split himself, he yearned to fly to Zhuolu immediately and get Ouyang Lan back.</p>
<p>However, he knew Ouyang Lan’s temper very well. Even if he went, it would be impossible for her to return because his temper was inherited from her. He knew very well that no one could stop her once she made up her mind.</p>
<p>“Overseer, the list of students who have rendered meritorious services has been compiled. The three students who helped us destroy the spider wells have also been found. The commendation ceremony has already been prepared. Should we start as planned?” An Sheng walked over and handed the document to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Act according to the plan. Go ahead and do it.” An Tianzuo didn’t look at the documents. Usually, such matters were handled by An Sheng. He didn’t think there would be any problems with such trivial matters.</p>
<p>“Yes.” An Sheng took back the document and left An Tianzuo’s office.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was constantly grinding at Snake Cavern, but he hadn’t had a Mutated Overlord Snake drop with Ever-Victorious. Therefore, he planned on inviting Wang Lu to try it out at Snake Cavern.</p>
<p>Wang Lu was listening to music in the living room when she heard the doorbell ring. When she opened the door, she couldn’t help but be surprised that Zhou Wen had actually knocked on her door. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Wang Lu, how much money do I need to hire you to accompany me to the Snake Cavern to hunt dimensional creatures?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu.</p>
<p>“You want to hire me?” Wang Lu was stunned before looking at Zhou Wen with interest.</p>
<p>“Yes, if it’s possible, we can head to the Snake Cavern now.” Zhou Wen nodded with certainty.</p>
<p>“You should know that I don’t lack money, right?” Wang Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly disappointed. “Sorry for disturbing you.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen prepared to leave when Wang Lu hurriedly said, “Hold on. It’s not impossible for you to hire me, but I don’t want money. I have one condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I want to go shopping tonight. Be my lackey and help me carry things,” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“No problem, I’m going to the Snake Cavern to kill the Mutated Overlord Snakes. I wish to use your luck to have a Mutated Overlord Snake egg drop.” Zhou Wen shared his motives.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be a big problem, as long as there’s a Mutated Overlord Snake there,” said Wang Lu with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Wang Lu headed to Dragon Gate Grotto where Snake Cavern was. Zhou Wen was already very familiar with the place, so killing Overlord Snakes was very simple for him. He only wished to meet a Mutated Overlord Snake. After all, it wasn’t something that could be found at any time. If there wasn’t a Mutated Overlord Snake, it wouldn’t matter how lucky Wang Lu was.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had clearly underestimated Wang Lu’s luck. Not long after they entered Snake Cavern, they saw an Overlord Snake that resembled black jade. It was a Mutated Overlord Snake.</p>
<p>[1] Double in Chinese lingo can mean clueless/idiot. So flipping the name becomes True Idiot.</p>
<h3 id='chapter246'>Chapter 246 Cracking the Cocoon</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the Mutated Overlord Snake as he ordered the Saber Shield Knight to charge forward.</p>
<p>The Saber Shield Knight had a Life Providence of Offense and Defense. Furthermore, his shield skills, saber skills, and battle aura skills were very powerful, making him the best at restraining Overlord Snakes.</p>
<p>The Mutated Overlord Snake charged over as the Saber Shield Knight activated the Everlasting Shield. The cross symbol on his shield immediately lit up with a holy radiance, as though it was a holy light that enveloped his entire body and his mount.</p>
<p>He used the shield technique to block the Mutated Overlord Snake’s attack before chopping down with the saber in his right hand with Cross Sword’s sword beam to kill it. This was what the Saber Shield Knight had always done.</p>
<p>However, this time, the Mutated Overlord Snake slammed into the shield, tearing it apart. It opened its mouth and bit down on the Saber Shield Knight’s head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got the Demonized General to charge forward as he struck out with Astral Fist, sending the Mutated Overlord Snake’s body flying out.</p>
<p>The Demonized General and the Saber Shield Knight attacked the Overlord Snake together, but they were still at a tiny disadvantage. When its tail swept, whatever was in its way, directly shattered.</p>
<p>Could it be that this is the Ever-Victorious skill? Zhou Wen was delighted instead of shocked. The Mutated Overlord Snakes he had encountered in the game weren’t that powerful.</p>
<p>“Baby Tiger, attack, bite it.” Wang Lu let her Lucky Baby Tiger help.</p>
<p>The abilities of Lucky Baby Tiger were considered inferior amongst the Epic stage, but it was naturally much stronger than the Legendary stage. It was very agile as it dodged the attack from the Overlord Snake. It pounced forward and bit down on the Overlord Snake’s neck, splitting it into two pieces.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen allowed his pet to withstand the attacks of the other Overlord Snakes while he took Bamboo Blade and peeled off the Overlord Snake’s head. Immediately, he saw two crystals inside.</p>
<p>One crystal was obviously a stats crystal, while the other was a black metal egg. It was none other than the Mutated Overlord Snake egg.</p>
<p>“Mission accomplished. Remember to be my lackey tonight,” said Wang Lu with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll definitely be there on time.” Zhou Wen put away his Companion Egg and rushed out of Snake Cavern with Wang Lu.</p>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen hurriedly used his cell phone to snap the Mutated Overlord Snake Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Mutated Overlord Snake: Legendary</p>
<p>Life Providence: Born Overlord</p>
<p>Strength: 20</p>
<p>Speed: 19</p>
<p>Constitution: 20</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 16</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Death Wrap, Devourer, Ever-Victorious.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Spear</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted to see this. Indeed, it was an excellent-grade Mutated Overlord Snake. Not only did it possess the Ever-Victorious skill, but it also had another skill, Devourer. It was much better than the one which dropped for him previously.</p>
<p>Luck is indeed useful. From the looks of it, I have to think of a way to have a Lucky Baby Tiger drop. Zhou Wen already had the urge to head to the Binyang Cave to grind for one.</p>
<p>He now had the two Epic skills—Ghost Steps and Transcendent Flying Immortal. He also had the Overlord Spear with Ever-Victorious. There was likely a chance for him to kill the weakest Epic tiger alone.</p>
<p>However, what was most pressing for Zhou Wen was still the white cocoon protected by the Golden Flying Ant; therefore, he headed to Ant City to try it out first.</p>
<p>After hatching the Mutated Overlord Snake, it didn’t take long for a black metal spear that was about twelve feet long to appear in Zhou Wen’s hand. Its entire body was made of black metal and the two blades on the spear emitted a cold glow that sent shivers down one’s spine.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had never practiced with spears before, but he had a Legendary Primordial Energy Skill-Penetrating Pierce. It possessed decent armor-piercing strength which suited Zhou Wen’s current use.</p>
<p>He waved his Overlord Spear a few times to familiarize himself with its weight and center of mass before putting it away and opening the Ant Nest instance dungeon.</p>
<p>After storming all the way to Ant City, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered clearing the ordinary flying ants and armored ants. He allowed his pets to battle the ant horde before taking Truth Listener and Ghost Bride to the Golden Flying Ant’s nest at the top.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant lunged forward at an astonishing speed. Zhou Wen used Ghost Bride to lure the Golden Flying Ant, while he used Ghost Steps to instantly charge to the side of the white cocoon.</p>
<p>With the Golden Flying Ant being led to the other side by Ghost Bride and how Zhou Wen’s Ghost Steps were ridiculously fast, making him no way slower than the Golden Flying Ant, it was already too late for it to rush back.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Overlord Spear and used Penetrating Pierce. At the same time, he unleashed all his strength and stabbed the white cocoon.</p>
<p>The spear’s blade chafed against the white cocoon, making metal-grinding sounds. It was harsh to the ears.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Overlord Spear’s tip had only stabbed a few inches in, failing to completely penetrate the cocoon.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant had already flashed over. It released golden beams at the blood-colored avatar furiously.</p>
<p>The silver wings on the back of the blood-colored avatar flapped as Zhou Wen used Ghost Steps again and charged out of the nest. At the same time, he ordered Ghost Bride to attack the white cocoon to attract the Golden Flying Ant’s attention.</p>
<p>The Golden Flying Ant was fooled as expected. It stopped chasing after Zhou Wen and charged at Ghost Bride. Golden beams of light shot through Ghost Bride’s body, but they didn’t injure her.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh. The strength of a dimensional creature isn’t absolute. If one’s attributes and skills are restrained, even an inferior Companion Beast might not necessarily be useless.</p>
<p>Using Dao Body to keep replenishing his Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen charged into the nest and stabbed the same spot again. However, he failed to completely pierce through the white cocoon and only broke a portion of it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s attack was augmented by Ever-Victorious and the armor-piercing strength of Penetrating Pierce, making the destructive power extremely terrifying. Yet, the cocoon remained resilient in a shocking manner.</p>
<p>After exiting the nest once again, Zhou Wen used the same trick to constantly entice the Golden Flying Ant and repeatedly attack the white cocoon. He repeated it dozens of times until Zhou Wen struck the same spot on the white cocoon again and felt the tip of the spear lighten as though he had penetrated half the spear into it.</p>
<p>It penetrated! Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly pulled out his spear.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen pulled out the Overlord Spear, he saw a beam shoot out from the hole. It was orange-red in color and looked extremely bizarre, but it didn’t seem to have any lethal force. It was like the light of an electric lamp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen glanced at the white cocoon’s hole and saw that it was entirely orange inside. And the source of the orange-red light was actually a curled creature.</p>
<p>The creature looked a little like a human. Its body was curled up and its hands hugged its legs as it curled into a ball. Its orange long hair covered most of its body.</p>
<p>On his head, there was a pair of strange feelers and on his back, there was a layer of translucent thin wings. The thin wings were very soft and looked like they hadn’t fully matured.</p>
<p>Inside the white cocoon is indeed a dimensional creature, but it doesn’t look anything like an ant. Zhou Wen dodged the Golden Flying Ant’s angry attack as he thought to himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter247'>Chapter 247 Taboo</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen timed his opportunity and once again charged to the side of the white cocoon. He thrust the spear in again, but this time, he stabbed straight at the strange creature inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heard a crisp sound like the sound of jade colliding. The spear tip failed to stab into the supple-looking skin. Instead, it felt like it had collided with a metal wall.</p>
<p>So hard? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he began to suspect the level of the dimensional creature within the white cocoon.</p>
<p>However, at this point, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to give up. All he could do was try, again and again, hoping to use repeated attacks to tear through the creature’s skin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was clearly futile. The continuous attacks failed to break through the creature’s skin, it was as if it was an indestructible piece of rock.</p>
<p>At this point, how could Zhou Wen be willing to give up? He gritted his teeth and activated the power of Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>The strength, Primordial Energy Skills, Primordial Energy Art of a Life Providence was different. To the typical person, it was a different kind of strength mode. However, to Zhou Wen, be it in-game or in reality, using the Sigh of the King was a very dangerous matter.</p>
<p>Once Life Providence was activated, not only would the blood-colored avatar in the game be affected, he would even be affected by the power of the Sigh of the King in reality.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t used properly, Zhou Wen would end up exploding to his death.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to use the Sigh of the King if he didn’t have a reason to do so. Even if he could stop in time, he needed to lie in bed for a few days before his body and bones would slowly heal. The pain and itchiness he ended up suffering was unimaginable to others.</p>
<p>Having used the Sigh of the King twice, Zhou Wen already had a taste of the feeling. If it was possible, he was unwilling to attempt it a third time.</p>
<p>But now, he had no choice but to use it again. With Overlord Spear with Ever-Victorious unable to injure the creature within the white cocoon, it was unknown when he would have the ability to kill the creature inside.</p>
<p>A terrifying force instantly descended upon Zhou Wen, causing the blood-colored avatar’s strength to surge.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to delay at all. With Ghost Steps and Transcendent Flying Immortal, the Overlord Spear in his hand brought with it the terrifying power that tore through space. Instantly, it stabbed into the white cocoon once again.</p>
<p>When the spear beam struck the creature’s skin, it shattered and scattered like glass shards. When the spear tip stabbed into the skin, it finally broke through its fair skin and stabbed a little deeper.</p>
<p>However, it was just a little. It was probably less than a centimeter from the tip of the spear. This left Zhou Wen alarmed.</p>
<p>Although the Sigh of the King’s power had only just been activated, it was enough to kill an existence like the Ghost King back in the Yin Yang world.</p>
<p>And with such strength, coupled with the fact that he had attacked with Overlord Spear’s Ever-Victorious, he had only barely torn open the creature’s flesh. This made Zhou Wen suspect that the dimensional creature in the cocoon might very well be at the true Mythical stage as spoken of in legends.</p>
<p>Although Banana Fairy and Truth Listener were also at the Mythical stage, they were only considered half-Mythicals. They might be able to advance to the Mythical stage in the future, but that was not the case now.</p>
<p>At the instant the tip of the spear stabbed into the flesh, the life form in the cocoon twitched. His head slowly turned, revealing part of his side profile. He looked flawless like a figure that had walked out of a painting. An orange-red eye also revealed itself as it stared at the blood-colored avatar through the hole bored through by the spear.</p>
<p>The eye exuded an indescribable diabolical feeling. Its pupil was like an orange gem, without any impurities. However, with that gaze, even Zhou Wen, who was outside the game, had goosebumps.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a force blasted out of the cocoon, instantly sending the Overlord Spear and the blood-colored avatar flying.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar flew right across Ant City’s sky like a cannonball before slamming into a stone wall.</p>
<p>Although the blood-colored avatar didn’t die immediately, Zhou Wen could sense that all the bones in its body had broken. The pain inundated Zhou Wen’s nerves, but this time, the bones weren’t broken by Sigh of the King, but by the terrifying force.</p>
<p>That must be a Mythical creature! A mere glance without any physical activity was enough to quake the blood-colored avatar that had activated the Sigh of the King to the brink of death. Such power was just too terrifying</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Nas</p>
<p>The Overlord Spear that had been snapped into several pieces slammed into the stone wall. The outcome of the Overlord Spear was worse than Zhou Wen’s. After it snapped, it immediately vanished and dissipated like ash. It left Zhou Wen heartbroken.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy for him to obtain the Overlord Spear with Ever-Victorious, but it was destroyed just like that.</p>
<p>Although this was a game where a Companion Beast could be revived, Zhou Wen’s first reaction when he saw the Overlord Spear destroyed was a heartache.</p>
<p>But as the Overlord Spear disappeared, a drop of sparkling orange blood dripped down from the tip of the spear. It was a gem the size of a grain of rice. It just remained suspended in midair.</p>
<p>‘Discovered Mythical Blood Essence. Absorb it?’</p>
<p>With the notification popping in-game, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate and hurriedly chose to absorb it.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar stretched out its hand with great difficulty. The Sigh of the King had already been deactivated, and the blood-colored avatar’s bones were almost completely fractured. Both his arms and fingers were bent as he stretched out with great difficulty to touch that drop of blood. At the same time, the game screen suddenly turned black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately had the urge to curse. The blood-colored avatar had failed to hold on and died right at that moment. If the blood was gone from the respawn, Zhou Wen’s efforts and hard work would have all been in vain.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was about to drip his blood and revive the blood-colored avatar, he suddenly felt a strange power flow out of the mysterious phone, instantly filling his entire body.</p>
<p>Due to the heavy burden of using the Sigh of the King, he had already shown signs of internal bleeding in several spots. Under the nourishment of the strange energy, he gradually snapped to his senses and recovered at an extremely fast speed.</p>
<p>In just a few seconds, Zhou Wen’s damaged body returned to normal. As for the strange power, it remained fused into his body, giving him an indescribable sense of comfort. He felt as though all his cells had been revived, as though he had been given a new lease of life.</p>
<p>After a long while, this feeling gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>After everything returned to normal, Zhou Wen hurriedly dripped a drop of blood onto the mysterious phone, allowing the blood-colored avatar to revive as he carefully read the blood-colored avatar’s information.</p>
<p>With this look, Zhou Wen immediately realized that his Primordial Energy stat had reached 21 points.</p>
<p>Just like before, there was an additional word behind his Primordial Energy value.</p>
<p>Taboo. Zhou Wen looked at the word, but he didn’t understand what it meant. He thought to himself, Strength has the postfix of Sun because it absorbed the God Power Crystal of the Sun God. Speed has Trajectory as its postfix because it absorbed the God Power Crystal of the God of Trajectory. Could it be that there’s also a god in the cocoon? Is his name the God of Taboos?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only make this guess, but he was unable to confirm it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter248'>Chapter 248 The Hope of Advancing to Epic</h3>
<p>The blood he obtained from the cocoon allowed Zhou Wen to see the hope of advancing to the Epic stage, he was just short of his Constitution reaching 21 points.</p>
<p>Now, Zhou Wen was aware of two locations where white cocoons could be found. One of them was at the nest of the chick’s mother. Zhou Wen didn’t dare go there. Even Ah Sheng didn’t dare put up any resistance. Even if he were to activate Sigh of the King, he would probably only be courting death.</p>
<p>Besides, now that the chick was with Zhou Wen and had helped him before, Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to touch the white cocoon that the giant bird was protecting.</p>
<p>Then the only one left is the white cocoon that’s protected by the wyrm under the Old Dragon Cave. Zhou Wen felt a headache coming on when he thought of the wyrm.</p>
<p>The wyrm was obviously much more powerful than the Golden Flying Ant. Perhaps the wyrm itself was a Mythical creature to begin with. If he wanted to tear through the cocoon and obtain the blood of the living creature within, he might as well have a fight with the wyrm and die a faster death.</p>
<p>Although he knew that there was no chance, Zhou Wen was bent on trying. As expected, before he even reached the stone pillar, the wyrm was jolted awake as it opened its mouth and roared, instantly killing the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Even Ghost Bride’s soul body wasn’t spared. Her soul was shattered by the dragon’s roar.</p>
<p>How can this be obtained? It’s impossible. Unless my body can withstand the power of the Sigh of the King and allow its full powers to manifest, only then might there still be a sliver of a chance. Zhou Wen put down his phone, having no intention of trying it a second time. It was useless even if he tried. They were not at the same level. In front of absolute strength, everything was in vain.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, where are you? I’ve been waiting for you all day.” Wang Lu called, her voice sounding rather angry.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ll be there soon.” Only then did Zhou Wen recall that he still needed to be Wang Lu’s lackey that evening. He hurriedly washed his face and left the building.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? You’re a man, and you’re late. You are in no way a gentleman,” Wang Lu said angrily.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. My bad.” Zhou Wen felt that there was no way of explaining himself because he had indeed done something wrong. All he could do was lower his head and admit his mistake.</p>
<p>“Since it’s your fault, you have to accept punishment. Do you have any objections?” Wang Lu said.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head.</p>
<p>“That’s what you said. You are not to go back on your word.” Wang Lu narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Apart from committing murder, arson, and immoral acts, you can punish me for anything.” Zhou Wen could only accept it.</p>
<p>“It’s not that serious. Follow me.” Wang Lu beamed even more, happy as she led Zhou Wen out of the school.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally believed that randomly leaving Sunset College was a privilege of people like An Sheng. Even Li Xuan couldn’t casually leave the school, but Wang Lu had easily led Zhou Wen out.</p>
<p>It’s still good to be privileged. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>There was already a car waiting outside the school. Wang Lu led Zhou Wen to the car and they headed for the biggest commercial street in Luoyang. Qin Xiyuan’s Xiyuan Crystal Shop was also on the street.</p>
<p>Wang Lu did not go to the crystal shop. She went to a store selling all kinds of cosmetics and clothes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t understand why Wang Lu was buying these things.</p>
<p>Sunset College was a partially militaristic school. Back on campus, students were only allowed to wear uniforms. The school uniforms were basically simple military uniforms.</p>
<p>Moreover, the college didn’t allow students to put on makeup. It was alright to secretly put on some light makeup, but if it was a little more obvious, the student council would find out and carry out disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Although Wang Lu was one of the elites of the college, Zhou Wen hadn’t seen her wear make-up when he saw her in school. He really didn’t know what those things were bought for.</p>
<p>However, Wang Lu was very happy as she flitted through the various shops. Soon, Zhou Wen became a humanoid rack with various bags hanging over his body. They were all things Wang Lu had bought.</p>
<p>“Does it look good?” Wang Lu walked out of the fitting room and walked around Zhou Wen in a lovely dress. She posed in a beautiful way as she asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Such clothes aren’t suitable for practice or battle, right?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the various cloth decorations hanging from the clothes.</p>
<p>Wang Lu glared at Zhou Wen fiercely. “I’m happy and it’s all out of my own free will. This, this, and this. Give me one of the same</p>
<p>color.”</p>
<p>Hence, Zhou Wen had a lot more bags on him. Although with his physique, it wasn’t a problem for him to carry more, he just couldn’t understand the point of buying them. The clothes looked identical, just in different colors.</p>
<p>After shopping for nearly four hours, and having two sumptuous meals in the middle, Wang Lu was finally satisfied. She went back to school with bags of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the items into Wang Lu’s building and was about to leave when Wang Lu stopped him.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving just like that?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I already fulfill my promise?” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“The promise is fulfilled, but the punishment for being late hasn’t been done yet. Don’t tell me you want to go back on your word?” Wang Lu’s eyes were filled with doubt about Zhou Wen’s character.</p>
<p>“Of course not. Tell me how you would like to punish me,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s very simple. I only bought the cosmetics looking at the color palette. I can’t see the real effects. Help me try them,” Wang Lu said with a cheeky smile as she took out a lipstick.</p>
<p>“You… want me to try this?” Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“You want to go back on your word?” Wang Lu’s questioning eyes became more obvious.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as the word seemed to be squeezed out through his teeth.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Sit tight. Don’t move.” Wang Lu was immediately delighted as she took out all the new cosmetics she had bought and swept them across Zhou Wen’s face.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat there motionless, feeling as though he was sitting on pins and needles.</p>
<p>Always angering me? Today, I’ll let you know what happens when you anger me. A devilish tail seemed to grow behind Wang Lu.</p>
<p>When it was almost midnight, An Jing returned from the device room. When she passed by Zhou Wen’s building, she subconsciously took a glance and saw that it wasn’t lit.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to return to her own building, she heard the door open to the building beside hers. A figure walked out.</p>
<p>An Jing originally thought nothing of it, imagining it was Wang Lu, but to her surprise, the figure walked to Zhou Wen’s building and entered the yard’s door.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen? An Jing couldn’t help but be taken aback when she saw that it was Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also saw An Jing, but his relationship with her was never that great. He nodded slightly as a form of greeting before opening the door and entering his building</p>
<p>Just a few results to show for and he’s already so brazen. Not only does he game every day, but he’s also fooling around in the dorm of a girl in the middle of the night. I really wonder what Grandpa and Mom see in him. An Jing felt extremely unhappy as her good mood instantly vanished.</p>
<h3 id='chapter249'>Chapter 249 Assembly</h3>
<p>After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen entered Dragon Gate Grotto’s instance dungeon and prepared to grind for the lucky tiger.</p>
<p>Wang Lu had allowed Zhou Wen to realize the magic of the Luck stat. Therefore, he wished to grind for a Lucky Baby Tiger to increase his Luck stat. It would be easier to take the Lucky Baby Tiger along with him if he wanted any Companion Egg to drop in the future.</p>
<p>The only problem now was that Zhou Wen needed to hatch an Epic Companion Egg at the Legendary stage. It would be somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how Wang Lu had managed it. He planned on trying to use the Dao Body’s rapid recovery of Primordial Energy. The tiger was relatively weak to begin with, so the amount of Primordial Energy he needed probably would be reduced. Perhaps, he could give it a try</p>
<p>In reality, the tiger was in high demand, but there was no one in-game to vie for it besides Zhou Wen. After Zhou Wen arrived at Binyang Cave, he quickly found the tiger.</p>
<p>Without another word, he summoned his Overlord Spear and circled to the back of the tiger with Ghost Steps and stabbed it in the rectum.</p>
<p>The tiger’s reaction wasn’t slow. With a flying pounce, it dodged the fate of having its rectum torn through. In return, its tail lashed out like a steel whip.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already studied it thoroughly. As he dodged sideways, he thrust out again, stabbing the tiger’s thin waist.</p>
<p>The Overlord Spear finally stabbed into the tiger’s waist. With Ever-Victorious showing its effect, the tiger let out a tragic cry when the spear stabbed through its skin. A blood hole opened up and its pelvis was damaged. With its movements greatly restricted, Zhou Wen quickly finished it off.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had killed an Epic creature alone in-game. Although it was the weakest Epic, it gave Zhou Wen a sense of accomplishment. However, it was very unlikely that the tiger would drop a Companion Egg</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expect to have the Lucky Baby Tiger drop on his first try, he could only try in passing. It wasn’t something he could keep respawning.</p>
<p>This was because there was only one tiger in-game every time, just like reality. After Zhou Wen killed it, he had to drip his blood to respawn, allowing the game’s instance dungeon to be refreshed before he could kill the tiger again. It would be such a waste.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen would kill the baby tiger every time he dripped his blood for respawning. Then, he would go elsewhere to grind for Companion Eggs or explore new instance dungeons. He waited until he died before respawning to have a chance of killing the baby tiger again.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any other Companion Beasts that can add to my Luck stat? When Zhou Wen was free, he went online to search for more information. He discovered that Luck stat was indeed rare. Although other Companion Beasts had similar effects, just like Little Tiger, they were targets that were vied for by many. It was difficult to obtain them.</p>
<p>Besides the baby tiger, the other known Companion Beasts with a Luck stat were extremely powerful Epic creatures. Their combat strength was many times stronger than the Lucky Baby Tiger’s.</p>
<p>While checking on the information, Zhou Wen also saw another Companion Beast with the opposite Luck stat. It was born with bad luck or, in other words, filled with misfortune.</p>
<p>One of the most famous ones in the East district was Tai Sui. If one had this Companion Beast, not only would it be the case of not having any luck with drops, but even buying a packet of instant noodles would come without any seasoning packets. Entering a dimensional zone would definitely result in trouble. It was an essential pet if one wanted to have a death wish.</p>
<p>The last Epic expert who had obtained Tai Sui originally believed that he had obtained a powerful Companion Beast. He had even shared the information he gained on his WeChat Moments to flaunt it, but he ended up dying in a dimensional zone the next day.</p>
<p>Who the hell would hatch such a Companion Beast? Zhou Wen carefully read the description of Tai Sui and remembered its appearance. It would be truly troublesome if he were to accidentally hatch it in the future.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to continue grinding instance dungeons, the school sent a notice to all the students, requesting that they gather at the field. It was unknown what had happened.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the field, he saw Wang Fei and his classmates already lined up. Li Xuan was waving at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly walked over and stood behind Li Xuan as he asked, “Li Xuan, what happened at the school? Why are all the students suddenly gathered?”</p>
<p>Such situations were rare in Sunset College. It focused more on pragmatic education, so it was rare for it to organize any student assemblies.</p>
<p>“I have no idea. I was sleeping soundly when I was awoken by a message. I don’t know what happened either,” Li Xuan said as he spread out his hands.</p>
<p>Soon, all the teachers and students gathered. Zhou Wen found it odd that there were even rows of soldiers on the field.</p>
<p>Although there were troops stationed on campus, they only guarded the school’s entrance or special places like the dimensional zones’ entrances. They rarely interacted with students.</p>
<p>Yet, the soldiers were participating in the student assembly held by the college. Moreover, the soldiers’ uniforms seemed different from those of the ordinary soldiers. It seemed like they were not the usual soldiers in the college.</p>
<p>After the managing vice-chancellor went on stage to say a few words, Zhou Wen and the rest of the students realized that the student assembly was to commend the students who had contributed when the Sky Spider wreaked havoc.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t pay much attention to this because he, Hui Haifeng, and Zhong Ziya hadn’t reported their names. The school didn’t include them, so even the rewards had nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Zhou Wen and company weren’t willing to accept the rewards, but that they originally believed that the credits given weren’t much. The trio weren’t people who lacked credits, so they were too lazy to report it. When the time came, the military would have to verify it and it would be extremely troublesome.</p>
<p>Since Zhong Ziya and Hui Haifeng found it troublesome, and Zhou Wen didn’t have any strong desire for credits, the three of them hadn’t bothered reporting.</p>
<p>If he had known that there would be actual material rewards, Zhou Wen would have reported his name no matter what. But now, it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking about this, he saw a few military officers arrive in the field. They were being escorted by soldiers. The managing vice-chancellor and the school’s upper management hurriedly stood up to welcome them, inviting the leading officer to the main seat.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s Overseer An. He’s so handsome!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been in school for three years, but this is the first time I’ve seen the Overseer in person. He’s even more valiant and imposing than the legends.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to get excited about. We Luoyang locals often get to see him.”</p>
<p>Instantly, there was a commotion among the students. An Tianzuo was like a god of war in Luoyang. Many of the students believed that he was a target and an idol to aim for in cultivation.</p>
<p>In fact, a large part of the reason many outstanding students chose Sunset College was because it was the An family’s school and An Tianzuo had also graduated here</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything special when he saw An Tianzuo. He treated him like a passerby.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo had acute senses. Even among the thousands of students, he immediately sensed Zhou Wen’s spot. However, he didn’t even look at him, as though Zhou Wen didn’t exist in his books.</p>
<p>An Sheng nodded at Zhou Wen with a smile, but the smile seemed to carry a deeper meaning.</p>
<h3 id='chapter250'>Chapter 250 We Are Honored By Them</h3>
<p>The process of the assembly was very simple. There weren’t many bigwigs speaking. Only An Tianzuo spoke a few words. Although he didn’t say a lot, his oomph left many students boiling with excitement. They wished they could join the army and fight to protect their homeland.</p>
<p>Many girls even had the urge to follow An Tianzuo to battle on the battlefield, even if they died for him.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Wen had to admit that An Tianzuo was the kind of person who was born with the charisma of a leader. If someone else were to say the same words, it would only appear awkward and pretentious.</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo’s delivery was infectious. He had a convincing charm, but Zhou Wen found it odd regardless.</p>
<p>Following that, it was the award ceremony for the students who had helped the army. All of them were named and invited on stage to receive their awards and military honors. Zhou Wen listened for quite a while but didn’t hear his name. It wasn’t unexpected.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was in a rather good mood today. Although he had had many troubles to deal with recently, he was in a better mood after seeing so many outstanding students at Sunset College. These people would imbue the army with fresh blood in the future.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo was waiting for the three most outstanding students’ turn and was prepared to personally decorate them with the medals.</p>
<p>“Overseer, the rewards for the other students have been distributed. Only the three students with outstanding contributions are left. Do you want to personally announce them?” An Sheng came to An Tianzuo’s side and handed a script to him.</p>
<p>“Alright.” An Tianzuo received the script and stood up from his chair before walking to the stage.</p>
<p>This was a very good opportunity to promote the military. An Tianzuo hoped that more students would be inclined to join the military in the future. This was one of the reasons why he had personally come to hand out the awards.</p>
<p>“I’m very relieved that there are so many outstanding students in my alma mater. While the students from other colleges are still studying hard, you have already grown to become a cornerstone of the League. On the battlefield, you poured your blood, using your bodies to create a steel wall for our siblings, parents, and elders. You have not let down the name of Sunset College.” An Tianzuo read the script written by An Sheng and found it somewhat odd. It didn’t seem to be his normal style.</p>
<p>This fellow has been lazing off again. He must have gotten a subordinate to pen it. With this thought in mind, An Tianzuo took a glance at the script before continuing.</p>
<p>He had a photographic memory. Just one glance was enough for him to memorize the entire contents of the piece of paper in his head. There was no need for him to continue reading from the script.</p>
<p>“Among excellent students like you, three of you have made me proud. They aren’t afraid of death, nor are they afraid of danger. They went deep into the spiders’ nest and destroyed the source of the disaster, saving the lives of countless citizens. They used actions to prove their excellence and, as a man, I’m glad that Sunset College has such students. I’m also proud that there are such men among humanity. Seeing them makes me see the League’s future. It’s a bright and glorious future…” An Tianzuo was almost done reading the contents of the first page, so he flipped to the second page and took another look.</p>
<p>The content on the second page was very simple. There were only three names.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo continued, “Let me invite these three outstanding students up on stage. I want to personally decorate them with a medal. Everyone, please remember their names. All of us should be proud of them. These three students are: Hui Haifeng… Zhong Ziya… Zhou… Wen…”</p>
<p>When he said the last name, An Tianzuo’s eyes glared at An Sheng as if he was shooting daggers at him with an extremely fierce killing intent.</p>
<p>If looks could kill, An Sheng would have been torn apart.</p>
<p>However, An Sheng lowered his head as if he had not seen anything as he concentrated on taking notes.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen heard his name, he was slightly taken aback before his expression turned extremely odd. The words that had just been said left him feeling a little odd. Furthermore, it came from An Tianzuo’s mouth, making him find it even stranger.</p>
<p>An Jing was stunned when she heard Zhou Wen’s name. She couldn’t believe that An Tianzuo would use such words to describe Zhou Wen, much less believe that he was one of the three.</p>
<p>“Was the person that the Overseer mentioned really Zhou Wen? Could it be someone sharing the same name?” It wasn’t only An Jing who didn’t believe it, even Wang Fei found it unbelievable. She had no way of connecting the selfish and indifferent Zhou Wen, who was engrossed in games, with the outstanding student An Tianzuo mentioned.</p>
<p>However, Wang Fei soon realized that the school only had one student named Zhou Wen, so it was impossible for it to be someone else who shared the same name.</p>
<p>“Why are you still standing there in a daze? Hurry up and go onstage to accept the medal. This is a medal, not something meaningless like a commendation certificate. Furthermore, it’s personally given out by Overseer An. I’m so envious. If I were to obtain such an honor, I could brag about it for three years…” Li Xuan said as he nudged the dazed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment. He didn’t wish to have any interaction with An Tianzuo. Furthermore, with their past, it made him feel uncomfortable standing in front of An Tianzuo and letting him decorate him with a medal.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for?” Wang Fei came over and gave Zhou Wen a nudge.</p>
<p>She felt gratified that she had taken Zhou Wen to Wang Mingyuan. Not long after, Zhou Wen had become so responsible and reliable.</p>
<p>Although she found it a little unreal, this was her initial wish for Zhou Wen-to go onstage to receive a medal. It was also a form of affirmation of her educational methods. It left her feeling honored.</p>
<p>Seeing that Hui Haifeng and Zhong Ziya were already onstage and how everyone was looking at him, Zhou Wen had no choice but to walk up to the podium.</p>
<p>An Sheng walked over with a tray in hand. An Tianzuo expressionlessly helped Hui Haifeng and Zhong Ziya wear the medals before rewarding each of them with a Companion Egg</p>
<p>When it was Zhou Wen’s turn, An Tianzuo walked over with a deadpan expression. His eyes met Zhou Wen’s for a second before they repelled like magnets of the same polarity. Their eyes subconsciously darted to the side.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo instantly returned to normal as he expressionlessly put on Zhou Wen’s medal. However, his actions were clearly much faster than when he decorated Hui Haifeng and Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>“Let us applaud Hui Haifeng, Zhong Ziya, and Zhou Wen for their sheer fervor, bravery, and responsibility,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>The applause below the stage boomed like thunder. Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo felt uncomfortable standing together, and their expressions were extremely stiff.</p>
<p>An Sheng took a photo of the two of them and recorded this moment.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen left the venue, he immediately took off the medal and threw it into the chaos space. Then, he felt discomfort in his chest as he patted it, as though he was swatting away something.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo got into the car and took off his white gloves, throwing them at An Sheng. With a cold expression, he said, “Drive.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter251'>Chapter 251 All Three Skills</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen waited for An Sheng’s notice as he made preparations for heading to Zhuolu.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen didn’t plan on truly entering the dimensional zone and only wanted to search for the tiny palm symbol, there was nowhere that was safe and peaceful now. Even Luoyang City had been attacked by a break-out creature. No one knew what would happen in uninhabited places.</p>
<p>The Gold-Armored Beast that Ouyang Lan had given him had been hatched. The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was also on him at all times. Once he left Luoyang, Zhou Wen planned on transforming the two Companion Beasts into their companion forms and wearing them—Golden Silk Soft Armor within and the full-body armor on the outside as double protection.</p>
<p>The Companion Beast reward at the assembly was a Legendary Bronze Figurine. It was a Legendary-grade Companion Beast without a companion form, but its combat strength was one of the best among Legendaries. It had a Life Providence of Undying Soldier, which greatly enhanced the Bronze Figurine’s survivability. It was very suitable for being a scout and vanguard.</p>
<p>This was what Zhou Wen deserved. He wouldn’t reject it just because of his relationship with An Tianzuo, so he also hatched it.</p>
<p>However, all of these were just support. The Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen could truly rely on were Truth Listener and Banana Fairy. There was naturally no need to elaborate on Truth Listener’s support abilities. It supported him in all kinds of situations.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was currently undergoing evolution. If it succeeded in evolving to the Epic stage, it would definitely be a tremendous boon for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The effects of Ghost Bride couldn’t be neglected. Instead, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Mutated Lotus Flower Ant that Zhou Wen had used often in the past, now appeared somewhat useless.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s flight ability was dispensable to the present Zhou Wen. The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s combat strength was only considered average.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wished to fuse the two together, but despite both being ants, their compatibility was astonishingly low, making it impossible for a fusion to succeed.</p>
<p>After sorting out his pets, he did another careful look. He was surprised to find that the Sky Spider youngling he had obtained recently was surprisingly compatible with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. It had a compatibility of more than 80%.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen chose to fuse the two together.</p>
<p>The fusion compatibility of that number didn’t disappoint him. The fusion was successful and, because both of them had been hatched, there was no distinction between main and supplement. The outcome of the fusion left Zhou Wen slightly stunned though.</p>
<p>After the fusion, the Companion Beast looked like it was mainly a Sky Spider. It still maintained the snow-white spider body, but it had four silver wings on its back. At the end of its tail, there was a stinger like a bee’s. It looked beautiful, and its silver-colored appearance made it look like a silvery-white plush toy.</p>
<p>Silver-Winged Sky Spider Youngling: Legendary (Youngling)</p>
<p>Life Providence: King of the Sky</p>
<p>Strength: 19</p>
<p>Speed: 20</p>
<p>Constitution: 19</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 20</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Silver Wing Flash, Magical Needle, Sky Spider Silk, Sky Spider Sanguine Venom.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Sky Spider Silver-Silk Glove</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. This fusion could be said to have been unprecedentedly successful. Not only had its stats increased, but it had also inherited all of the talent skills of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Sky Spider youngling. Furthermore, its Life Providence had also changed.</p>
<p>Previously, the Sky Spider Child was the Son of the Sky, while the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was a King of Low Altitudes. Now that the two had fused, it became the King of the Sky. Zhou Wen took a look and realized that the Life Providence had increased its flying abilities. It wasn’t like it had been in the past where it could only fly at low altitudes.</p>
<p>What was even more valuable was that the Silver-Winged Sky Spider was still a youngling. There was still room for future growth, so it would definitely be able to advance to the Epic stage in the future. However, it was unknown how long it had to be fed before it could advance to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Summoning the Silver-Winged Sky Spider in its companion form, a translucent silver-silked glove immediately appeared on Zhou Wen’s left hand. The glove clung tightly to his skin as though it was weightless. It was difficult to sense its existence as though it was a layer of skin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tested the glove’s ability and found that it was rather interesting. Apart from its excellent defensive powers, the Sky Spider Silver-Silk Glove also possessed a type of stickiness. As long as Zhou Wen was willing, the Sky Spider Silver-Silk Glove could stick to anything. Furthermore, if Zhou Wen didn’t deliberately separate, it would be difficult to pull him away from the adhered surface.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting companion form gear. If I use it well, it might be of great use in the future. Zhou Wen retracted the Sky Spider glove.</p>
<p>After organizing his gear, Zhou Wen refreshed the instance dungeon once again. To his pleasant surprise, he finally gathered the three Mutated Demonized Generals’ abilities and had Astral Fist, which he had always wanted, drop.</p>
<p>He directly learned Astral Fist and focused all three Demonized Generals’ skills on him, but Zhou Wen didn’t feel any qualitative changes in his strength. The might of the three Demonized General techniques was no different from the typical Demonized General.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, what the Wu siblings said was a lie. Nothing impressive happens when all three Demonized General skills are gathered. How is it possible to catch the arrow shot out from Tiger Cage Pass? Although he had already obtained confirmation by using his Mutated Demonized General, he was still somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>However, with this in mind, Zhou Wen suddenly had a thought. Would there be any changes if I were to use three Demonic General techniques at the same time?</p>
<p>But I only have two hands. I can use the Astral Slash Blade with one hand and the other with the Astral Suction Palm. What other free hand do I have to use Astral Fist? Zhou Wen carefully sensed the information regarding Astral Fist, only to have his expression turn odd.</p>
<p>Although the Astral Fist was called a fist, it was a Primordial Energy Skill that condensed all of one’s strength. When using the Astral Fist, one’s body would produce an effect similar to a Dominance Body. It wasn’t really necessary to deliver an actual punch.</p>
<p>In that case, I can try using all three skills at once. Zhou Wen tried once in the game and used the three demonized skills at the same time, but he encountered difficulties again.</p>
<p>The three demonized skills were all unranked Primordial Energy Skills. When used, the amount of Primordial Energy allocated determined their might. Basically, Zhou Wen had to use all his Primordial Energy at once to produce the greatest strength of Astral Slash Blade.</p>
<p>Now that the three skills were used together, it was impossible for him to use his Primordial Energy in such a manner. All he could do was distribute his Primordial Energy equally among the three Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen’s three Primordial Energy Skills were activated, his body experienced a strange change.</p>
<p>The three Primordial Energy Skills resonated with one another, attracting and repelling each other. They formed a very subtle balance that caused the blood-colored avatar’s body to emit a strange sanguine glow. It was as though it was enveloped by a sanguine light.</p>
<p>If one looked closely, they would discover that the sanguine light was rapidly revolving around the blood-colored avatar’s body. Zhou Wen had no idea how to use this force, so all he could do was attempt to strike forward.</p>
<p>Immediately, a blood-colored wheel of light flew out of his body, striking the battlefield in front of him. It immediately minced an ancient war chariot into pieces.</p>
<p>That’s right, it wasn’t cleaving, but mincing. It was as though the chariot had been stuffed into a meat grinder and had instantly been minced into pieces.</p>
<p>What terrifying strength! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed as he looked at his palm.</p>
<h3 id='chapter252'>Chapter 252 Demonic Astral Wheel</h3>
<p>‘Acquired Comb Skill: Demonic Astral Wheel’</p>
<p>A notification appeared on his cell phone screen. Then, Zhou Wen saw that in the blood-colored avatar’s skill column, there was indeed an additional Demonic Astral Wheel. And the three Demonized General techniques from before had vanished.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhou Wen came to a realization that the Demonic Astral Wheel combined the effects of all three Demonized General skills. It combined offense and defense into one system, making it far more powerful than any of the original skills individually.</p>
<p>Why am I able to acquire the Demonic Astral Wheel while the Mutated Demonized General who has all three skills is not able to obtain the Demonic Astral Wheel? Do I need him to use all three skills simultaneously to acquire it? Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Demonized General and attempted to command it to use all three skills simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, the Mutated Demonized General’s control over Primordial Energy was clearly not as strong as Zhou Wen’s. It was very difficult to achieve that intricate balance of using the three Primordial Energy Skills at the same time.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it’s not an easy task to make the Demonized General acquire the Demonic Astral Wheel. Zhou Wen gave up temporarily and left for a future endeavor.</p>
<p>Now, all Zhou Wen wanted to do was give it a try to see if the Demonic Astral Wheel could catch the arrow shot from Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>In fact, even if Zhou Wen didn’t use the Demonic Astral Wheel, he could still dodge the arrow by relying on Ghost Steps. He just hadn’t attempted to rush into Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar came in front of Tiger Cage Pass and directly stepped over the threshold. Indeed, just like before, an arrow tore through the air and instantly traversed the battlefield, shooting right at the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t make the blood-colored avatar retreat. Instead, he used the Demonic Astral Wheel. The spinning wheel like sanguine light slammed into the arrow’s tip.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately saw a strange scene. The revolving Demonic Astral Wheel spun together with the arrow. However, the direction of their spin was different.</p>
<p>The Demonic Astral Wheel spun forward like a car wheel, while the arrow spun like an electric drill. The moment the two collided, the arrow changed direction and landed on the ground in front of the blood-colored avatar. Furthermore, the strength left in the Demonic Astral Wheel wasn’t significantly expended.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood why the Wu siblings said that the fusion of the three skills allowed one to counter the arrow. The arrow’s power mode was very similar to the fusion of the three skills. When both powers were simultaneously in effect, the arrow would automatically deviate from its trajectory; thus, not causing any damage to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. He no longer produced Demonic Astral Wheel, but instead allowed it to continue spinning like a shield as he walked towards Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Another arrow shot out from Tiger Cage Pass. However, the moment the arrow touched the Demonic Astral Wheel, it was automatically diverted to the ground, blasting a huge crater into the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. With the Demonic Astral Wheel’s protection, he quickly charged into Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of arrows shot out from Tiger Cage Pass and rained down like a heavy storm.</p>
<p>However, the arrows that landed on Zhou Wen’s body deviated from their trajectories due to the Demonic Astral Wheel. They shot into Zhou Wen’s side without even damaging his clothes.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was feeling smug, he saw the Demonic Astral Wheel suddenly vanish. In the next second, the blood-colored avatar was pierced by thousands of arrows and shot to death on the spot. The phone’s screen turned black.</p>
<p>I forgot that this Demonic Astral Wheel expends plenty of Primordial Energy. Even with Dao Body activated, there’s no way for me to sustain it for long. Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged. The Demonic Astral Wheel was already strong enough and what he lacked was only Primordial Energy. In the future, when he advanced to the Epic stage, his Primordial Energy would increase and the Demonic Astral Wheel would only grow stronger.</p>
<p>However, storming past Tiger Cage Pass sure is a little troublesome. I wonder what kind of figures are inside. The legendary Tiger Cage Pass in Romance of the Three Kingdoms does have a very famous general. Could the person shooting arrows at the city gate be him? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>He really wanted to see who the person inside Tiger Cage Pass was. Zhou Wen dripped his blood to respawn and entered the game once again. However, he first went to Binyang Cave to kill the tiger before heading to other spots to grind. Only after all of that was done, did he come to Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>He switched his Primordial Energy Art to Dao Body, the Primordial Energy Art that Zhou Wen used the most frequently. Quickly recovering his Primordial Energy was just so useful. Zhou Wen only found it regretful that it wasn’t fast enough; otherwise, he could use all sorts of Primordial Energy Skills indefinitely.</p>
<p>If I were to advance to the Epic stage, I wonder if Dao Body would be able to produce a Life Soul. If Dao Body also had a Life Soul, I might really be able to recover Primordial Energy without end. Zhou Wen was only secretly fantasizing.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior transformed into Golden Silk Soft Armor while the Gold-Armored Beast transformed into armor that covered the former. Then, Zhou Wen sent the blood-colored avatar rushing towards Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>As the arrow flew like the wind, the blood-colored avatar directly activated the Demonic Astral Wheel and fended off the arrow. The Demonic Astral Wheel was only activated in momentary bursts, to conserve Primordial Energy to its fullest extent.</p>
<p>Just like before, after the blood-colored avatar closed in, the rain of arrows once again launched a dense attack.</p>
<p>However, these arrows were not as terrifying as the previous arrows. Most of the arrows’ strength was only at the ordinary Legendary stage. Only one of the arrows could instantly kill a Legendary.</p>
<p>However, with so many Legendary arrows, it was impossible for ordinary Legendary creatures to withstand them. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to use his body to experiment. At the instant the arrows rained down, the blood-colored avatar’s figure vanished. When it appeared again, it had already left the volley of arrows behind as it continued heading for Tiger Cage Pass.</p>
<p>As he approached the city walls of Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen could roughly see that there were many guards on it.</p>
<p>Unlike the bedraggled soldiers before reaching the threshold of Tiger Cage Pass, these soldiers were all dressed in bright armor and looked majestic. They looked extraordinary at a glance.</p>
<p>On the steps of the city gate was a powerful and domineering general dressed in black armor. There was wine on the table in front of him, and beside him was a halberd. He was also holding a longbow in his hands, and the person who shot the arrows was undoubtedly him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhou Wen had already rushed to the gates of Tiger Cage Pass and was about to leap up to the city gates, the black-armored general threw the wine glass in his hand and suddenly rose up. He grabbed the nearby halberd and thrust it at the blood-colored avatar that came whooshing through the sky.</p>
<p>The black-armored general’s aura seemed to transform into a black ferocious beast’s shadow. The shadow was like a tiger or lion, but it had three heads, like a three-headed hell hound.</p>
<p>In the next second, terrifying power erupted from the halberd. It shattered the Demonic Astral Wheel and two layers of armor on the blood-colored avatar and killed it on the spot as it exploded into a bloody mist.</p>
<p>Epic stage! Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. He didn’t choose to dodge with Ghost Steps, but instead forcefully received the strike. He wanted to know how powerful the black-armored general was, and as expected, it was a top-ranked Epic creature who wasn’t any weaker than the Golden Flying Ant. He might even be stronger.</p>
<h3 id='chapter253'>Chapter 253 Introspection Silence</h3>
<p>“Overseer, the people you invited have arrived. Would you like them to immediately head to Zhuolu County?” An Sheng came to An Tianzuo’s office and asked.</p>
<p>“Let them rest at the villa first. After I’m done with my work, I’ll head to Zhuolu with them,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“Overseer, are you really heading to Zhuolu personally?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“My mom is there. If I don’t go, how can I feel at ease?” An Tianzuo said.</p>
<p>“Overseer, please consider it carefully. Even if you were to go, Madam won’t change her mind because of your request. When that happens, it will be hard to deal with the situation on both ends. Neither will Madam be invited back, nor will Chess Mountain have you around. There will be no way to resolve problems that happen. When the time comes, the An family’s business and the Luoyang City that you swore to protect will be destroyed. If that happens, Miss Luo won’t be happy if she learns of it,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the words “Miss Luo,” An Tianzuo’s eyes revealed a strange look. However, he said coldly, “Don’t mention it to Little Luo. It won’t work this time. Filial piety is most important of all the virtues. My mom is in such a dangerous place with her life possibly at risk at any moment; how can I sit at home?”</p>
<p>“Then let me ask you. Will Madam return if you go?” An Sheng asked.</p>
<p>“No, but I can accompany her to the ancient battlefield,” said An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>“You can indeed do that, but what about Luoyang? It can’t run without someone watching it for even a single day. This place needs you. Besides, even if you accompany Madam to the ancient battlefield, won’t she still be in danger? You can’t guarantee that she will be safe and sound,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“If I don’t go, she will be in even greater danger.” An Tianzuo was adamant.</p>
<p>“The safest way is to persuade Madam back. Actually, there’s a way to get her back,” An Sheng said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“And what do you plan on doing? How are you going to persuade her?” An Tianzuo curled his lips. He knew Ouyang Lan’s character very well. Since she had decided to go, no one could persuade her to return.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely not capable of doing so, but there’s someone who can,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“Who? Uncle Feng? I’m afraid he can’t do it either. If he could, my mother wouldn’t have gone to Zhuolu.” An Tianzuo shook his head slightly. Ouyang Lan wouldn’t give up on her thoughts and principles for Zhou Lingfeng.</p>
<p>The reason she chose Zhou Lingfeng was partly because he was a man who knew how to respect her.</p>
<p>“Uncle Feng naturally can’t, but there’s someone who can,” An Sheng said confidently.</p>
<p>“Who else?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly, but he couldn’t figure out who An Sheng was referring to.</p>
<p>“Overseer, how could you forget that there’s still Zhou Wen? Madam wanted Zhou Wen to take the risk in the Holy Land in An Jing’s stead. Although Zhou Wen returned safely and even benefited from it, he has offended the six families because of this. With Madam’s personality, she definitely feels that she owes him. With Zhou Wen’s relationship with the former principal, if Zhou Wen were willing to persuade her, Madam might have a change of heart. No offense, but letting Zhou Wen go will be more effective than both you and Miss Jing,” An Sheng said.</p>
<p>“No way. There’s no need for an outsider like him to interfere with the An family’s matters. Besides, he’s only a Legendary student. Going to a place like Zhuolu would only add trouble to the mix. Who knows what trouble he will cause.” An Tianzuo immediately objected.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that to Old Mr. Ouyang, you are an outsider. He treats Zhou Wen better than he treats you. This time, Zhou Wen has taken the initiative to request to go to Zhuolu, so we can get him to persuade Madam. I think it’s rather suitable. It’s more useful than you going,” said An Sheng.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo frowned and thought for a moment before saying, “Watch him well. Don’t let him cause any trouble. Also, if he wants to go, it has nothing to do with our An family. He can’t blame others even if he dies there.”</p>
<p>“Overseer, don’t worry. I will watch over him and not let him cause any trouble,” said An Sheng hurriedly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen received An Sheng’s notification that he would be setting off for Zhuolu tomorrow. Therefore, he had no choice but to head to Wang Mingyuan’s place at night to bid farewell.</p>
<p>“You are going to Zhuolu?” Wang Mingyuan frowned slightly when he heard Zhou Wen say that.</p>
<p>“Yes, the former principal treated me like family. If I don’t go, I will never be able to feel at peace,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Zhuolu is an inauspicious land. It’s fine if you don’t enter, but if you enter, it will be very difficult for you to escape unscathed,” said Wang Mingyuan after some thought.</p>
<p>“I know my strength is limited, so I’ll only wait outside. I won’t enter the dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>When Wang Mingyuan heard that, he only smiled and patted Zhou Wen on the head. “Although you haven’t been with me for long, I know your personality quite well. If you don’t wish to do something, why would you travel so far?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened his mouth to explain, but Wang Mingyuan waved his hand, gesturing for him to not say any more.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment,” Wang Mingyuan said. He walked to his desk, took a piece of paper and pen, and wrote a few words. Then, he folded the paper into a small square and placed it into a metal box the size of a matchbox.</p>
<p>“Take this. If you really find yourself trapped in that inauspicious land, open the box and read the words on it. It might be beneficial to your situation.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he stuffed the tiny metal box into Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Teacher.” Although Zhou Wen felt that it was useless, he respectfully received it with both hands and bowed in thanks.</p>
<p>“How many times have I told you that there’s no need for all these proprietaries with me? Look, when did Ziya ever say ‘thanks’ when he took something from me?” Wang Mingyuan smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m different from him, but I respect you the same way.” Zhou Wen shook his head and said. He really couldn’t be like Zhong Ziya.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had an indescribable sense of familiarity towards Wang Mingyuan. It was as though his fate with him was like the former principal. With his cold personality, he couldn’t help but get close to him.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan thought nothing of it. He took a book from his desk and handed it to Zhou Wen. “You should have plenty of free time on your way there. You can’t forget your homework. Take this book and tell me your understanding and thoughts when you’re back.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took the book and agreed. Wang Mingyuan didn’t keep him any longer and told him to return to do some packing. After Zhou Wen exchanged a few more words with the reading Jiang Yan, he saw that Zhong Ziya and Hui Haifeng weren’t around. Since it was late, they probably wouldn’t be coming, so he bade everyone farewell and left.</p>
<p>After informing Li Xuan and company, he asked Wang Lu to take care of the antelope. Zhou Wen went to the supermarket again and bought large quantities of food and water, placing them in the chaos space to prepare for emergencies.</p>
<p>The tiny metal box that Wang Mingyuan had given him had also been placed into the chaos space. He had no intention of entering the dimensional zone, so it definitely had no use.</p>
<p>He picked up the book that Wang Mingyuan had given him and flipped through it. He realized that it wasn’t about palm techniques, but was a book named “Introspection Silence.” It was filled with Wang Mingyuan’s experience and insights. However, it wasn’t about his experience in experimenting, but his experience in cultivating the various realms.</p>
<p>Although the book didn’t have any cultivation methods or techniques, Zhou Wen read with relish as though he had obtained a treasure.</p>
<h3 id='chapter254'>Chapter 254 Bells</h3>
<p>An Sheng came to pick Zhou Wen up and set off with more than ten people. However, other than Zhou Wen, they were basically experts at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Although most of them were older than An Sheng, they were still respectful towards him. None of them dared to put on any airs with him.</p>
<p>However, most of those people didn’t look like soldiers. There were men and women, old and young. They looked very strange, a mystery where they had come from.</p>
<p>They weren’t interested in Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them either. Therefore, he was happy to be at peace and game in the vehicle.</p>
<p>With the black-armored general guarding Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to make any progress. However, he recalled what the Wu siblings had said. There was apparently a secret passage that allowed one to enter Tiger Cage City. However, despite repeatedly searching in-game, he failed to find the secret passage.</p>
<p>Could it be that there’s no secret passage in the game? Or could there be some mechanism to the secret passage? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to guess.</p>
<p>“Lad, is the game fun?” asked a man sitting opposite Zhou Wen. He had graying hair, but he looked like a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>They were on a military-sized truck. It had very powerful cross-terrain capabilities, but it was a little shaky. It was not too crowded even with more than ten people sitting in it.</p>
<p>“It’s fun,” Zhou Wen answered casually.</p>
<p>“It’s very rare to see young people enjoy gaming like you these days. Back when I was your age, everyone played games and there were all sorts of gaming competitions. After the dimensional storms, not many people play anymore. How nostalgic,” the man said.</p>
<p>“You experienced the dimensional storms?” Zhou Wen looked at the man in surprise. He didn’t look old.</p>
<p>Before the man could say anything, a middle-aged man beside him pursed his lips and said, “You don’t even know the name Lord Alcohol? Young man, you still have a lot to learn. Take your time to learn.”</p>
<p>However, Lord Alcohol laughed and said, “I was originally the ninth child in the family and people used to call me Old Nine. However, with age, I began to enjoy alcohol. Gradually, I became Lord Alcohol. It’s just a nickname. How should I address you, young man?”</p>
<p>“My name is Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen answered. Clearly, these people didn’t know of his background and only knew that he was brought here by An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen.” Lord Alcohol repeated it twice as though he was recalling information related to the name. Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything. Hence, he added, “Are you going to the ancient battlefield in Zhuolu?”</p>
<p>“I’m still a student. How can I have the guts to go to such a place?” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Oh, then why are you going to Zhuolu?” pressed the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>“To study and broaden my horizons,” Zhou Wen answered. He wasn’t familiar with these people, so he was perfunctory with his answers.</p>
<p>“Reading ten thousand books isn’t as good as walking ten thousand miles; even more so in this era. It’s not bad for young people to come out and broaden their horizons,” said Lord Alcohol with a smile.</p>
<p>“What’s terrible if he dies before he learns anything,” a woman in her thirties suddenly said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. A place like Zhuolu isn’t a place you can visit at a whim. Even the League’s scouts get trapped inside. It’s practically a land of death. Lord Alcohol, how confident are you in our trip?” The middle-aged man wasn’t interested in Zhou Wen. After saying a few words, he directed his words at Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. The situation in the ancient battlefield is unclear. Just based on the information we have now, it’s hard to tell. I can only assess the place after I get there,” said Lord Alcohol calmly.</p>
<p>As they were talking, the truck suddenly came to a halt.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Lord Alcohol looked at the driver’s seat and asked.</p>
<p>“There’s something blocking the way.” An Sheng, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, had already opened the door and jumped out.</p>
<p>The group of people came out from the back of the truck and saw that the road ahead was, indeed, blocked by something. However, it wasn’t anything like a rock. Instead, vines had grown on the road, circling the trees on both sides of the road and blockading the road.</p>
<p>Everyone could tell that the vines were somewhat strange-purple vines, dark green leaves, and a few fruits on them.</p>
<p>However, the purple fruits were a little strange as they were not circular. Instead, they looked like miniature, copper bells. When the wind blew, the purple copper bells shook on the vines and produced metallic tinkling.</p>
<p>But everyone could clearly see that the bell was clearly grown on the vines. How could it be metal?</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, let me lead the way,” said a muscular middle-aged man as he walked out.</p>
<p>“Be careful.” An Sheng nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man responded and summoned a dimensional creature that looked like an elephant. He immediately made the elephant charge towards the vines. Flames began to burn from the elephant’s body, making it appear like a hurtling meteor that targeted the vines.</p>
<p>With the Flaming Elephant’s mass and speed, it should have been easy to smash through the vines. What’s more, there were terrifying flames on its body.</p>
<p>But when the Flaming Elephant slammed into the vines, it seemed to fall into a quagmire. It was trapped by the vines and was unable to make any progress.</p>
<p>It released all its strength, hoping to use its flames to burn through the vines that had entangled its body. The flames spread over the vines, and soon, the entire vine began to burn.</p>
<p>However, the vine wasn’t damaged. Instead, the Flaming Elephant’s body rapidly dried up, as if it had been sucked dry by a vampire.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>In just a short time, the Flaming Elephant’s body was reduced to ash.</p>
<p>Everyone wore a heavy expression as the stout man was perturbed. Although the Flaming Elephant was only a Legendary Companion Beast which he used to scout, for it to be so easily killed by the vines meant that they were probably not so simple.</p>
<p>The flames on the vines gradually extinguished. The muscular man was just about to make another move when he saw the bells suddenly shake violently.</p>
<p>In the next second, a few purple copper bells spewed out large amounts of flames as they swept towards the group.</p>
<p>The cold woman summoned a white fox. The fox opened its mouth and spat out a cold white mist that shot towards the flames. Immediately, the flames were extinguished as the white mist continued floating towards the vines.</p>
<p>Soon, the cold mist enveloped the vines, causing frost to appear on them as if they had been frozen.</p>
<p>“Snow Fox lives up to its name,” praised the muscular man.</p>
<p>But just as he said that the frost on the vines rapidly melted. The purple copper bells shook a few times, and they also spat out a large amount of white mist that swept towards the crowd.</p>
<h3 id='chapter255'>Chapter 255 Three Flying Sabers</h3>
<p>Everyone’s faces changed.</p>
<p>It was fine if the Legendary Flaming Elephant was sucked dry by the vines, but the Snow Fox was an Epic creature. The frost mist it spewed out could freeze an Epic creature.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the vines weren’t affected, it could even spew out frost snow mist. Furthermore, the frost snow mist it spewed out was even greater in quantity than the amount Snow Fox had spat out. This was quite frightening.</p>
<p>The woman frowned slightly, causing the Snow Fox to spit out another mouthful of frost. It mixed with the white mist that spewed out of the bells before both sides dispersed simultaneously. Neither side had the upper hand.</p>
<p>The woman wanted to continue but heard Lord Alcohol say, “Director Lu, don’t be in a hurry to make a move. Let me take a look first.”</p>
<p>Lu Ning nodded slightly. She unsummoned the Snow Fox and retreated to the side.</p>
<p>The muscular man looked at him and asked, “Lord Alcohol, do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Lord Alcohol. They, too, wanted to know what the vines were.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol sized up the vines and said, “I’ve seen a similar vine in Changbai Mountain before. It wasn’t growing bells, but three flying sabers. Back then, the people I went with wanted to cut the vines, but they were killed by the saber flashes. Many ideas were proposed until the flying sabers were plucked from the vines.”</p>
<p>At this point, Lord Alcohol paused as he swept his gaze across everyone’s faces before continuing, “To everyone’s surprise, the flying sabers were a fascinating Companion Beast. Whoever plucked the flying sabers would be automatically recognized as their masters and belong to them. Back then, three people were delighted to obtain the flying sabers. The flying sabers were extremely powerful, and they were considered top-notch at the Epic stage. And it was true they were extraordinary. From what I’m seeing, these vines are somewhat similar to the one at Changbai Mountain. But it’s not completely the same. Perhaps they share some similarities.”</p>
<p>When everyone heard what Lord Alcohol said, their desire for the bell heated up-it was evident from their eyes.</p>
<p>They had already seen the might of the bell. If they could obtain one as their Companion Beast, it would undoubtedly be a powerful aid.</p>
<p>“Lord Alcohol, how did you pluck the flying sabers back then?” the muscular man, Zhao Xin, hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol recalled and said, “Back then, that vine was the same as this one. It was invulnerable and had the saber flashes of the flying sabers protecting it. It was really tricky.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Lord Alcohol, hoping that he could quickly tell them the solution, so that they could try it on the bells.</p>
<p>However, Lord Alcohol shook his head and said, “I don’t know how they managed to pluck the flying sabers in the end.”</p>
<p>“Lord Alcohol, are you kidding us? Weren’t you at the scene? How could you not know?” Zhao Xin said in disbelief.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol gave a bitter smile and said, “I was indeed present at that time and saw how they plucked the flying sabers. However, despite watching with my own eyes, I still can’t fathom how they did it.”</p>
<p>“What? Who were the people who plucked the flying sabers?” Lu Ning was curious and couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was also very curious. The places he had visited were limited and his knowledge was limited. To be able to hear such a secret would probably aid him in the future.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol said, “You must all have heard the names of the three people who plucked the flying sabers. Even if you haven’t met them, you definitely know them. One of them is called Jing Daoxian.”</p>
<p>“That devil, Jing Daoxian?” Everyone trembled when they heard that.</p>
<p>Jing Daoxian’s name had made the League tremble for decades. Few people who knew of his deeds were unafraid of him.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol continued, “I really have no idea how Jing Daoxian managed to pluck the flying sabers. When the others approached the vines, they were slain by the saber flash. However, Jing Daoxian actually walked in front of the vines and reached out to pluck one of the flying sabers. The flying sabers didn’t react at all. I opened my eyes wide and watched him pluck them, but to this day, I have no idea how he managed to do it.”</p>
<p>Although what Lord Alcohol said sounded like a fantasy, no one found it amiss. It was as though no matter how bizarre it was, it was not surprising when it involved Jing Daoxian.</p>
<p>“Lord Alcohol, who were the other two people who plucked the flying sabers?” An Sheng seemed interested as he looked at Lord Alcohol and asked.</p>
<p>“The other two people were Zhang Daotian and Wan Yiqi.” When Lord Alcohol said these two names, everyone except Zhou Wen gaped.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How could the strongest of the six heroes, Zhang Daotian, and his wife, Wan Yiqi, be together with that devil, Jing Daoxian? Aren’t they arch-enemies? Why would they go to Changbai Mountain together and pluck the flying sabers together?” Zhao Xin immediately voiced the puzzlement in his heart. This was also a question on everyone else’s minds.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen recall that the strongest of the six heroes was Zhang Daotian. In closed circles, people even gave him the title of Hero King. However, the Zhang family didn’t send anyone to participate in the battle at the Holy Land. It wasn’t because they had declined, but because the Zhang family didn’t believe in vying for such qualifications.</p>
<p>The discussion forum that Zhou Wen had posted his strategy was under the Zhang family. The other five families found it difficult to obtain information about the Zhang family. Even most of the League’s currency system was in the hands of the Zhang family. Although the Zhang family didn’t have military power, its influence on the Senate and the League could be said to be the strongest among the six families.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also heard some of Zhang Daotian’s stories. Basically, it was known to all in the League.</p>
<p>Back then, Jing Daoxian had stormed into the League government office and slaughtered countless League experts. He was almost unstoppable. In the end, Zhang Daoxian had defeated him. Only then did Jing Daoxian escape with injuries, failing to wipe out the upper echelons.</p>
<p>“Back then, they were still young. Jing Daoxian wasn’t yet the legendary devil. Zhang Daotian wasn’t a Hero King and Wan Yiqi hadn’t married Zhang Daotian either,” said Lord Alcohol with a smile.</p>
<p>“I see. Then how did Zhang Daotian and Wan Yiqi pluck the flying sabers?” Lu Ning asked curiously.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol chuckled. “Zhang Daotian and Jing Daoxian both walked over and plucked the flying sabers. They didn’t suffer any attacks from the flying sabers. As for Wan Yiqi, you might not believe her method of plucking the flying saber.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me she bit it off with her mouth?” Zhao Xin joked.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol glanced at Zhao Xin and said indifferently, “If you were to let Jing Daoxian hear that, you would probably be dead.”</p>
<p>Zhao Xin’s heart chilled as he forced a smile. “Even if there’s any anger, it should be from Zhang Daotian. It has nothing to do with Jing Daoxian, right?”</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol ignored Zhao Xin and continued, “Wan Yiqi had the title of a Beauty across the Seven Continents. She was definitely the most beautiful back then. Even the flying sabers were mesmerized by her. Before she even reached the flying saber, it automatically dropped and fell into her hands.”</p>
<p>Everyone found it unbelievable when they heard that. They felt that Lord Alcohol was bullsh*tting. No matter how beautiful a woman was, it was impossible for her to affect dimensional creatures. Furthermore, it was a flying saber, so how could it understand the aesthetic preferences of humans?</p>
<h3 id='chapter256'>Chapter 256 Plucking Bells</h3>
<p>Although Lord Alcohol’s story sounded interesting, they still had no clue how to pluck the purple copper bells from the vines.</p>
<p>To follow what Lord Alcohol had said and walk over directly to pluck it? Not only did Zhou Wen find it unreliable, but Zhao Xin, Lu Ning, and company also found it unreliable. The stories that Lord Alcohol told could be treated as a fairytale, but it was impossible for them to act on it. No one would use their lives to verify the authenticity of the story.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lord Alcohol couldn’t come up with any ideas, Zhao Xin summoned a long saber and slashed out a saber beam, hoping to slice through the vines.</p>
<p>However, when the saber beam struck the vines, the vines remained intact as the saber beam shattered.</p>
<p>The few bells shook as they sucked in the broken saber flashes. Soon, they spat them out again. However, when they spat out again, the saber beams poured out like a torrential storm. Everyone quickly used their own abilities to block the saber beams that filled the sky.</p>
<p>An Sheng stood in front of Zhou Wen as he brandished his dagger a few times, shattering the incoming saber beams.</p>
<p>Although no one was injured, everyone’s hearts were shrouded in gloom. The vines and bells were so bizarre that not only could they devour all kinds of powers, the strength of the objects they spat out was even stronger than before. It was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Instantly, no one dared to attack the vines again. They still had stronger powers up their sleeves, but if the power was absorbed by the vines and spewed back, they were not confident that they could withstand it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the vines from behind as he took a picture of it with his cell phone. Although a living dimensional creature couldn’t be acquired through the phone, he wanted to see if he could see its information.</p>
<p>The phone’s screen locked onto the vines. There was actually some information on the vines.</p>
<p>Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell Companion Egg: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Mountain River Absorption</p>
<p>Life Soul: Purple Light Bell</p>
<p>Strength: 38</p>
<p>Speed: 0</p>
<p>Constitution: 39</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Yin and Yang Reversal</p>
<p>Companion Form: None</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he saw it. This was clearly the stats of one of the Purple Air Bells. He looked at the other bells and realized that other than the four fundamentals, the rest were the same. There was basically no difference between the four bells.</p>
<p>It’s really a Companion Egg. However, will plucking them really be considered as incubating them? Zhou Wen wasn’t certain. He took out his cell phone to take a picture of the purple vines, but he couldn’t see its stats.</p>
<p>The mysterious phone seemed to only be able to snap Companion Eggs and not dimensional creatures, so there was nothing Zhou Wen could do about it.</p>
<p>After studying the four bells’ Life Providence, Life Soul, and talent skill, Zhou Wen gained something unexpected.</p>
<p>Mountain River Absorption allowed the Purple Air Bells to be unafraid of Primordial Energy Skills. No matter how powerful a Primordial Energy Skill was, it would be useless if it landed on it. Instead, it would be absorbed.</p>
<p>As for Yin-Yang Reversal, it could release whatever Primordial Energy it absorbed multifold. Apart from not being able to move, the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell was indeed an extremely powerful Companion Beast.</p>
<p>However, plant-type Companion Beasts were somewhat odd. Even without hatching them, they could still release their powers. Furthermore, as long as they were plucked, one didn’t need to use their Primordial Energy to especially hatch them even if they had already been incubated.</p>
<p>However, the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell also had its weakness. It was not afraid of Primordial Energy Skills, but it was afraid of physical attacks. It was completely opposite from the characteristics of Ghost Bride.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it didn’t have any destructive power. It needed to absorb energy from the outside world to produce a backlash. It was a very passive Companion Beast.</p>
<p>In that case, as long as I walk over and don’t use any Primordial Energy Skills to attack it, I should be able to pluck it? Zhou Wen felt that it was feasible, but his only concern was the Purple Vine.</p>
<p>The bells themselves didn’t have any offensive properties, but it wasn’t necessarily the case for the purple vine. It had easily squeezed the Flaming Elephant to death.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol and the others were still discussing. It wasn’t that they were lacking in intelligence, but that they had never seen the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell before. They didn’t know what abilities this thing had. It was akin to an ancient person who had just come into contact with a smartphone. No one taught them nor was there any manual, so it was impossible for him to immediately know how to use it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was different. He had the Purple Air Bell’s manual and knew how to restrain it.</p>
<p>It was a rare opportunity. These four Purple Air Bells would be of great use in the future, but Zhou Wen didn’t want to risk it himself. Hence, after some thought, he said to An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, I’ve thought of a way to pluck the bells. When you pluck all four of them, how about giving me two?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen spoke very softly, but Lord Alcohol and the others were Epic experts. They had sharp senses and heard Zhou Wen’s words.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin looked at Zhou Wen and said, “This isn’t a game. Don’t harm Adjutant An with your speculations.”</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol added, “Zhou Wen, tell us what method you have and let us study it. If it’s really valuable, we naturally won’t hold back what you deserve after plucking the bells.”</p>
<p>Some people felt that Zhou Wen was young and naive, while others wished that Zhou Wen could share his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, tell me what needs to be done. I’ll do as you say and pluck the bells. We’ll split them two-two.” An Sheng seemed to believe in Zhou Wen without any hint of doubt.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should reveal his thoughts in front of Lord Alcohol and company.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, please speak your mind. Even if someone else uses your method, they will still have to give you the bell after plucking it. No one can take that bell,” An Sheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and handed his Bamboo Blade to An Sheng. “Just walk over and chop off the bells. However, you have to be careful. Don’t be entangled by the vines or use Primordial Energy Skills. Just slice off the bells with the blade.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen An Sheng’s capabilities and knew that his movement techniques were extremely strange. Even Ghost King’s movement technique wasn’t as strange as his. With his ability and reaction, it was difficult for an Epic creature to injure him.</p>
<p>“I thought you had some good ideas. Aren’t you asking Adjutant An to send himself to his death?” Zhao Xin turned to look at An Sheng and said, “Adjutant An, don’t listen to the young man’s nonsense. Let’s quickly discuss something else and remove these vines.”</p>
<p>When An Sheng pushed the Bamboo Blade back, Zhou Wen imagined that he hadn’t believed him. Just as he was about to explain, An Sheng pulled out his dagger and walked towards the vines.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An, are you really going?” Zhao Xin and the others were shocked.</p>
<p>An Sheng said calmly, “If Young Master Wen says it will work, then it will definitely work.”</p>
<p>With that said, An Sheng had already approached the vines. Indeed, the purple vines moved, wanting to bind him. However, An Sheng was just too fast. He easily avoided the vines’ entanglement and came in front of the bells. With a swift slash, his dagger sliced at the roots of a bell.</p>
<p>The previously imposing Purple Air Bells remained motionless. An Sheng’s dagger had directly cut off a bell.</p>
<p>An Sheng reached out to catch the bell. The moment the bell touched his skin, it transformed into a purple gas and melted into a tattoo that resembled a morning glory flower.</p>
<h3 id='chapter257'>Chapter 257 Blood Storm</h3>
<p>Without any hesitation, An Sheng dodged the purple vines’ attacks while cutting off another Purple Air Bell. However, An Sheng didn’t take it for himself this time. Instead, he used his dagger to lift the Purple Air Bell.</p>
<p>The Purple Air Bell flew straight at Zhou Wen. He reached out to receive it, and the Purple Air Bell turned into a purple gas that seeped into his skin. Without needing to expend any energy to incubate it, it had already become a tattoo that resembled a morning glory flower. It left Zhou Wen overjoyed.</p>
<p>It was difficult for Zhou Wen to incubate ordinary Epic stage Companion Eggs, but the Purple Air Bell was unique. There was no need for any incubation, allowing him to obtain an Epic Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Soon, An Sheng picked another bell and Zhou Wen caught it once again. He obtained another Epic Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The last bell was caught by An Sheng after he sliced it off. He also had two Purple Air Bells.</p>
<p>With all four Purple Air Bells cut off, the purple vine suddenly seemed to have lost its soul as it froze.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew and the purple vines dissipated into dust. The perfectly fine purple vine was gone.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company looked at Zhou Wen oddly. An Sheng got everyone to return to the vehicle and they continued on their journey.</p>
<p>“Pal, how did you know that those bells fear physical attacks?” Lord Alcohol asked once they were on board.</p>
<p>The others also looked at Zhou Wen. To be able to tell the crux of the problem in such a short period of time wasn’t an easy task.</p>
<p>“I only gained inspiration from listening to your story,” Zhou Wen said. “My story?” Lord Alcohol was a little stunned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen continued, “That’s right, your story. Didn’t you say that those flying sabers didn’t harm the three of them? I was wondering why they didn’t harm Jing Daoxian and company. Although I couldn’t think of the reason, I thought of the problems with these bells. They only counterattacked when we attacked, and they didn’t have the consciousness to take the initiative to attack. Furthermore, their counterattacks were using our powers. I then wondered if it was the same reason as those flying sabers not causing any harm. Hence, I thought about it and surmised that since they do not have any offensive abilities, I could get Adjutant An to give it a try. I never expected him to succeed.”</p>
<p>“As expected of a young man. They are so quick to think. It’s no wonder Adjutant An thinks highly of you. I’m really getting old. Even if I made the connection, I wouldn’t have dared to try it,” praised Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>“Even a broken clock is right twice a day. He made Adjutant An take a risk on a mere guess. He was right this time, but if he was wrong, wouldn’t he have harmed Adjutant An?” Zhao Xin said with a twitch of his lips. Clearly, he was against Zhou Wen’s actions.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t refute Zhao Xian and Lord Alcohol because they weren’t wrong. If it was only a guess, Zhou Wen would have been extremely irresponsible to have An Sheng take such a risk.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t making a guess. He had crucial information and knew that Ansheng would be fine. That was why he had sent him over. However, there was no need for Zhou Wen to explain to others.</p>
<p>On the way, they encountered many problems. However, these people were experts at the Epic stage. They each had their own unique traits, so they resolved the problems without needing Zhou Wen to do anything.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept playing games. After respawning the tiger a few times, he still failed to have a Companion Egg drop.</p>
<p>When can I be like Wang Lu and run around with the baby tiger to have Companion Eggs rain? Zhou Wen yearned for a Lucky Baby Tiger, but he just couldn’t get one to drop.</p>
<p>Originally, driving from Luoyang to Zhuolu didn’t take more than a day. However, there were many dimensional zones everywhere in this day and age. They were unable to proceed in a straight line, and highways didn’t allow easy passage. They also encountered problems along the way, so it took them until the evening of the fourth day before they finally arrived at Zhuolu County.</p>
<p>There weren’t many ordinary people in Zhuolu County anymore. Most of the humans had already fled to larger cities, leaving only a small number of independent hunters and some military organizations behind.</p>
<p>An Sheng drove straight into a yard that looked like some unit. There were many soldiers inside.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An.” An officer immediately came forward to greet An Sheng.</p>
<p>“How’s the situation over here? Where’s Madam?” Ansheng asked.</p>
<p>“Madam has already entered the ancient battlefield with the rest.” The officer smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“What happened? Didn’t I tell you to calm Madam down first and let her wait two days before entering?” An Sheng’s expression changed immediately.</p>
<p>Although he was not a biological son of the An family, An Tianzuo and Ouyang Lan treated him like family. An Sheng had long treated them like family too.</p>
<p>“We did what you instructed. Madam had already agreed to it, but two days ago, an anomaly happened in the ancient battlefield. Madam couldn’t wait any longer, so she led people inside,” the officer said.</p>
<p>“What anomaly?” An Sheng’s expression turned even nastier. If there was an anomaly, it meant that it was even more dangerous.</p>
<p>“It began raining on the ancient battlefield. It was very heavy rain and the color of the rain was red. Anyone who came into contact with that blood-like rain would act up like a rabid dog. They would bite any living thing they saw. When the blood started to rain, a few soldiers didn’t notice it and were drenched by the blood rain. In the end, when we saw those soldiers, they had already ripped each other up into an unrecognizable mess.” The officer couldn’t help but shiver at the mere recall.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, stay at the base and wait for me. I’ll go to the battlefield to take a look.” As An Sheng spoke, he prepared to lead his men to the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>“Ah Sheng, take me along. I’ll just stay outside the battlefield to watch. I won’t cause you any trouble,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Alright. However, you have to promise me that you will definitely not enter.” An Sheng knew that Zhou Wen’s personality was too similar to the An family’s members. Even if he didn’t allow Zhou Wen to go, he would definitely do so by himself. Therefore, he might as well take him along and watch over him.</p>
<p>“I won’t enter as said. Don’t worry. I know that my powers are limited, so I won’t cause you any trouble.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. He had no intention of entering since it wasn’t a place he could step into.</p>
<p>An Sheng got someone to bring over the latest information. He then gave Lord Alcohol and the rest a copy each and let them take a look while they were on the way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also received a copy. After getting into the vehicle, he carefully read through it.</p>
<p>The situation at the battlefield was indeed terrible. When the expedition team first arrived, the dimensional zones there weren’t that strange, without much danger inside. Having only found some ancient ruins, they invited many experts to conduct some studies. Among them was an authority in the field of history, Ouyang Ting—the former principal.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, the ancient battlefield grew stranger and stranger. More than a month ago, the old principal, a group of experts, and the people protecting them were trapped in there and were nowhere to be found. Only one soldier in charge of watching over the equipment escaped.</p>
<h3 id='chapter258'>Chapter 258 Ancient Battlefield</h3>
<p>The League had already sent a few groups of people in to search for their whereabouts. However, the changes in the ancient battlefield were too intense. Many people died there, but no one was found. In the end, the League basically gave up.</p>
<p>When Ouyang Lan came, the League’s army was only guarding the ancient battlefield and was no longer sending anyone in.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan had originally wanted to wait for An Sheng to come, but after the sudden blood storm in the ancient battlefield, Ouyang Lan was afraid that her father wouldn’t be able to hold on any longer. Without having the luxury of time to wait, she decided to lead her men into the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>Based on the current information, as long as the blood rain didn’t hit the skin, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem. However, the strangeness of the ancient battlefield was far from that.</p>
<p>The old principal and the others were stationed in some ancient ruins as their research targets. However, when the soldiers of the military rushed over, many of them ended up dying in the ruins. Even the cause of death remained unknown.</p>
<p>If Ouyang Lan wanted to find her father, she would definitely head there first. An Sheng was afraid that Ouyang Lan would die there, a result that he had no way of telling An Tianzuo and An Jing when he returned.</p>
<p>The vehicle quickly arrived at the entrance of the ancient battlefield. The scene in front of them made Lord Alcohol and the others wear even graver looks.</p>
<p>A river surged down. On their side of the river there was blue sky, and opposite the river was a storm cloud blanketing the river with blood rain. The two banks of the river were like two completely different worlds.</p>
<p>The river was as red as blood. It roared as it flowed downwards; its ultimate destination unknown.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t such a river in the past, right?” An Sheng took out the map in the documents and said.</p>
<p>“This was formed after the blood storm. The blood storm was especially violent previously, so it’s already considered a lot smaller now,” the officer from before said.</p>
<p>“Prepare to cross the river and enter the ancient battlefield.” An Sheng instructed his men to distribute the rainproof equipment to Lord Alcohol and the others.</p>
<p>As Lord Alcohol wore a custom raincoat, he looked at the boundless torrential rain and muttered to himself, “Legend has it that during ancient times when the Yellow Emperor fought Chiyou, Chiyou summoned the Count of the Wind and the Lord of the Rain to aid him in battle when he realized he was no match for Yellow Emperor. This caused a storm to sweep through the enemy, causing the Yellow Emperor to drop his armor and flee. This rain is blood-red and is an ominous omen.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also knew that this was an ancient battlefield. However, that was a time from eons ago. He had only heard some legends and didn’t know exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>However, he had heard of the Lord of the Rain before. Some said that the Lord of the Rain was an orthodox god sealed by the Heavens and Earth, while others said that the Lord of the Rain was actually a manifestation of a crimson dragon. Anyway, there were many legends, and nothing to be treated seriously. It couldn’t be treated seriously.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I will bring Madam back. Before that, you cannot enter the ancient battlefield no matter what.” Before An Sheng left with the rest, he had especially told Zhou Wen not to enter.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll wait for you to bring Sis Lan back.” Zhou Wen was in a rush to find the tiny palm symbol. There were no city gates or stone monuments here, so he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>“Battalion Commander Lu, protect Young Master Wen well. No matter what happens, Young Master Wen has to live. Also, don’t let him cross the river,” An Sheng said to the officer.</p>
<p>“I guarantee that I will complete the mission.” Lu Yun gave a military salute and loudly promised.</p>
<p>Only then did An Sheng cross the blood river with the others. Soon, they disappeared into the blood rain. The group appeared so puny in under the wrath of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to be in a daze. He turned around and walked along the river of blood. He needed to find the tiny palm symbol so that he could provide a little help.</p>
<p>“Principal, Sis Lan, please don’t let anything happen to you.” Zhou Wen quickly walked along the river.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, where are you going?” Battalion Commander Lu Yunxian rushed forward to stop Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>From his point of view, Zhou Wen shouldn’t have come to such a place. For a student to come here, other than causing trouble and wasting manpower, he really didn’t know what else he could do.</p>
<p>“I want to tour the vicinity,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“No, I’m afraid not. Adjutant An told me to protect you. Nothing must happen to you. Please return to the encampment with me immediately,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An told you to ensure my safety and not restrict my freedom. If you can’t do it, you can get someone else to do it,” Zhou Wen said as he circled around Lu Yunxian and followed the blood river upstream.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian frowned slightly, but he still followed him with his guards. Although he disliked Zhou Wen very much, he had to abide by An Sheng’s orders no matter what.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen walked in front while Lu Yunxian led his guards to a spot not far from him. Zhou Wen stopped walking to take photos with his cell phone, as though he was here on a tour.</p>
<p>As such, not only did Lu Yunxian dislike Zhou Wen, even the guards couldn’t hold back their displeasure. If An Sheng hadn’t ordered them to protect a person like him, they wouldn’t have wanted to.</p>
<p>“Things have already come to this stage and everyone is working hard. But what is he doing? He has the mood to come here to have fun and take pictures,” a guard said unhappily.</p>
<p>Another guard added, “If I had known this would happen, I’d rather have followed Adjutant An across the river to the ancient battlefield and try my best to save lives. I wouldn’t have to suffer this bullsh*t.”</p>
<p>“Cut it out.” Lu Yunxian stopped them.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t stand Zhou Wen, he was a soldier after all. His profession required obeying orders.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally heard the discussions of the soldiers, but he couldn’t explain it.</p>
<p>He walked along the river and walked for more than five kilometers, but he didn’t find any sign of the tiny palm print, nor did his phone respond.</p>
<p>They had arrived in an area that was mountainous up ahead. According to the information provided, the mountainous region was also within the dimensional zone Furthermore, there were the dark clouds of the blood rain blanketing it. Zhou Wen couldn’t find the palm symbol, so he could only head back downstream.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and company originally believed that this scion was finally returning, but to their surprise, Zhou Wen continued walking downstream without any intention of returning to his origin.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, it’s getting late. The sky is about to turn dark. We should go back. If you are interested, you can come back in the day tomorrow,” said Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>“The sky isn’t dark yet. Let’s continue walking.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to wait another day. If he found the tiny palm symbol earlier, he could help the efforts. Perhaps this would lead to a greater chance of rescuing the former principal.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian couldn’t help but frown, but since Zhou Wen had already begun walking away, he had no choice but to follow him. However, his expression didn’t look too good as he remained silent with a cold expression.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Lu Yunxian and the rest were unhappy, but he could only feign ignorance. He continued searching along the river and couldn’t help but pray inwardly. Please let there be the tiny palm symbol!</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, Zhou Wen’s heart grew heavier. The sun had already set, but he had still failed to find the tiny palm symbol.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen was wondering if there even was a tiny palm symbol here, his phone suddenly vibrated. Zhou Wen was immediately delighted as he hurriedly took it out and scanned his surroundings.</p>
<p>There it is! When Zhou Wen saw the tiny palm symbol on an ancient monument, he nearly teared up with excitement.</p>
<h3 id='chapter259'>Chapter 259 First Battle With An Ancient Creature</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly scanned the tiny palm symbol. He finally relaxed when the phone showed that it was downloading.</p>
<p>I hope I’m not too late. Zhou Wen looked at the blood rain that covered the opposite side of the river like a fog. He wondered how the former principal, Ouyang Lan, and An Sheng were doing.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen scanned the tiny palm symbol on the stone monument, a shadow suddenly appeared behind it—a huge blood frog. It spat out a mouthful of bloody liquid at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian rushed to Zhou Wen’s side and grabbed his shoulder with one hand, throwing him to the back. At the same time, he raised a shield with his other hand to block the bloody liquid.</p>
<p>The metal shield was corroded, leaving pockmarks. It had nearly melted through.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian held a saber in his other hand and slashed with a blade beam, splitting the blood frog into two.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, can we return now?” Lu Yunxian turned to Zhou Wen and asked.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen stood up and patted the dust off his body.</p>
<p>He then followed Lu Yunxian back to the garrison. The game had finished downloading. On the cell phone’s home screen, there was an icon of a Boundary Stone. On it was the word, Zhuolu.</p>
<p>He clicked and entered the Zhuolu instance dungeon and soon, the blood-colored avatar appeared on the ancient battlefield that was covered in blood rain. However, before Zhou Wen could control it, he saw the blood-colored avatar charge out maniacally and fall into the river of blood. Then, the screen went black.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. He had died the moment he spawned. This was clearly not a good sign.</p>
<p>How do I defend against the blood rain? Zhou Wen lowered his head in thought. In reality, he could use custom raincoats. Not only were they waterproof, but they had pretty good defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>However, there were no raincoats in-game. All Zhou Wen could do was attempt to wear the soft armor manifested by the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and the armor from the Gold-Armored Beast. However, neither of them could completely cover his body, so it was unknown if it would work.</p>
<p>The results proved that it was useless. As long as his skin was stained with the bloody rain-even a drop of it-he would lose control of his blood-colored avatar as it ran like it had rabies, eventually dying tragically in the blood rain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen attempted to activate the Lotus Flower Buddha Body to see if he could withstand the corrosive effects of the blood rain. Only by doing so did he survive in the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>However, the Lotus Flower Buddha Body constantly expended his Primordial Energy. Zhou Wen had to switch his Primordial Energy Art to a Dao Body to sustain the continuous expenditure of the Lotus Flower Buddha Body.</p>
<p>As he proceeded through the blood storm, his vision was seriously hampered. The visibility was reduced to less than three meters, but thankfully, Zhou Wen had the Truth Listener earring. It allowed him to possess senses similar to radar.</p>
<p>Trudging through the muddy land, Zhou Wen proceeded towards the location indicated by the military map. The place he was heading to was the ruins that the former principal and the others had researched. It was also where they had vanished. It was definitely the place where Ouyang Lan and An Sheng were headed for.</p>
<p>After a short walk, Zhou Wen heard a figure walking towards him.</p>
<p>It was a creature that looked like a human. Its hair reached to the ground and covered its face. Its limbs were long and slender, and its entire body was drenched in blood. Its movements were very strange, like a zombie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare lower his guard. He summoned the Saber Shield Knight and Demonized General and got them to charge forward first. No matter what it was, it was a creature inside the ancient battlefield. It was definitely not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>However, the Saber Shield Knight and Demonized General were unable to withstand the blood rain’s poison. They lost control of themselves and began killing each other.</p>
<p>Does the blood rain have the same effect on a Companion Beast? Zhou Wen’s mood worsened. Without being able to use a Companion Beast and having to constantly activate Lotus Flower Buddha Body to expend his Primordial Energy, this greatly reduced his combat strength.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The strange creature suddenly moved at an incredible speed in the rain. Instantly, it appeared in front of the crazy Demonized General. It grabbed his head with both hands and twisted it off. Then, it casually threw the head to the ground and ripped off the Saber Shield Knight’s head.</p>
<p>This is indeed not a place for people. Zhou Wen could tell from his opponent’s speed that it was definitely an existence at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>He had encountered an Epic creature the moment he entered the ancient battlefield. It was even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined</p>
<p>Initially, he thought that even if it was the battlefield found in myths, there should be some lesser soldiers and generals. It was impossible for them to all be high-level creatures. But now, it seemed as if his wishes had been too ideal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen decided to summon all his Companion Beasts to see if they could withstand the blood rain, so as to gauge how much combat strength he had left.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride was unafraid of the blood rain as she floated beside Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The Mutated Overlord Snake in the Overlord Spear form wasn’t affected either. It could be used in the blood rain.</p>
<p>The Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and the Golden-Armored Beasts were unaffected in their companion form. However, the Silver-Winged Sky Spider was unable to withstand the power of the blood rain, as it went into a frenzy.</p>
<p>The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant was fine and even Doctor Darkness wasn’t affected. Truth Listener and the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell could also be used.</p>
<p>The number of pets that Zhou Wen could use in the blood rain was much better than he had expected.</p>
<p>As he watched the monster charge at him, Zhou Wen tightened his grip on the Overlord Spear. At the instant the monster reached him, he used Ghost Steps and circled behind the monster. Augmented by Ever-Victorious, the Overlord Spear pierced through the monster’s back.</p>
<p>Ever-Victorious was indeed useful. The tip of the spear pierced straight through the monster’s body and stabbed into its back and out of its chest.Read more chapter on vipnovel.com</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted, but he suddenly saw the monster’s body explode like a water ball, splattering black liquid all over the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>The black liquid quickly flowed through the blood rain, as if it had a life of its own. It gathered together again, distorting into the monster’s appearance.</p>
<p>What is this fellow? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Just as he was about to launch another attack, he saw the screen turn black. The blood-colored avatar had died again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. After some thought, he understood how the blood-colored avatar had died.</p>
<p>It must be because the black liquid came into contact with my body. From the looks of it, that monster has a toxicity that’s stronger than the bloody liquid. Zhou Wen was at a loss.</p>
<p>Although he knew that the monster possessed such power, he still couldn’t find a way to resolve it.</p>
<p>The monsters appeared to be water-elemental, so Overlord Spear’s attack with Ever-Victorious didn’t have much effect on it. Furthermore, he possessed a powerful corruptive ability, one that Lotus Flower Buddha Body was unable to withstand. An Epic stage dimensional creature was just too strong. Before Zhou Wen advanced to the Epic stage, he would always find it difficult to fight any Epic creature.</p>
<p>I have to find a way to counter it. Zhou Wen knew very well that experience was the best teacher. He entered the game once again and continued to seek out the monster’s weakness in battle.</p>
<h3 id='chapter260'>Chapter 260 Finding Weakness</h3>
<p>Lu Yunxian was extremely displeased with Zhou Wen. He just couldn’t understand why An Sheng would bring him to such a place.</p>
<p>Ignoring the reckless touring of the area, he spent all his time gaming after he returned to the garrison. He truly was an eyesore.</p>
<p>However, Lu Yunxian was relieved that Zhou Wen didn’t cause any trouble for them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t their fault they were irritated by Zhou Wen. The way he acted was just detestable. If Zhou Wen were in Lu Yunxian’s shoes, he probably wouldn’t have liked such a person either.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had his reasons. Even though he knew it incurred the displeasure of others, he could only continue doing so.</p>
<p>Through repeated battles and repeated deaths, Zhou Wen’s physical condition and blood regeneration abilities began to find it difficult to keep up with the expenditure, despite it only being one drop of blood each time.</p>
<p>Usually when gaming, Zhou Wen would switch to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, significantly improving his ability to recover. However, when he died too frequently, he would still suffer from anemia. He didn’t know if it would cause any latent risks to his body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also thought of getting a blood transfusion to make up for the loss. Although the blood transfusion required some troublesome paperwork, he should be able to obtain it if he thought of a way.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ultimately gave up on the idea of a blood transfusion. He didn’t know if the blood that was transfused into his body would count as his or the other person when dripped onto the mysterious phone.</p>
<p>He took out the blood supplements he had brought from the chaos space. Although he didn’t know if they were of any use, it was better than nothing. Even a placebo was useful.</p>
<p>As he had earned a huge sum of money from selling Companion Eggs the last time, the supplementary medicine Zhou Wen had bought was clearly a lot more high-end. There was also good stuff like American ginseng and donkey-hide gelatin.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen searched everywhere, but he didn’t find any ingredients like an electric pot. He didn’t even have a hot water flask, so he could only call Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian was discussing the latest intelligence with his colleagues. The changes in the ancient battlefield were getting more and more serious. Besides the blood river, dimensional creatures would occasionally appear.</p>
<p>Now, the garrison troops of the League were constantly clearing the monsters and, although they came under the jurisdiction of Luoyang’s An family, the situation was so terrible that An Sheng and company would definitely be affected while inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lu Yunxian heard his phone ring. He took a look and realized it was Zhou Wen. He frowned and answered the call.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, what’s the matter?” Lu Yunxian asked.</p>
<p>“Is there anything like a rice cooker or an electric kettle? I need to cook something,” Zhou Wen said as he gamed.</p>
<p>“This is a military encampment, not a college dormitory. There are no such things,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“Then, is there any way to boil stuff here?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“I’ll send someone over. If there’s anything you need, tell her. I’m currently in a meeting.” Lu Yunxian said before hanging up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart. He was only asking and it was fine if he couldn’t boil the supplement. He planned on buying the utensils needed to boil the blood replenishing supplement the next time before coming out and placing them into the chaos space.</p>
<p>In-game, Zhou Wen was fighting a monster. So many deaths weren’t without any rewards. He had mostly figured out the monster.</p>
<p>The monster was like a water ghost. It possessed water-elemental strength and ordinary physical attacks were useless against it. Furthermore, its body had a powerful virus. Any contact with its body would result in infection, even if it were a drop of water.</p>
<p>If one was physically resistant enough, they could still last for a period of time. Otherwise, an instant death was possible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was only at the Legendary stage. Relatively speaking, his physical qualities were relatively weak. He could use the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to withstand the virus for a little while longer, but it wasn’t of much use.</p>
<p>What was even more frightening was that the monster could mix its poison into the blood rain. It was completely impossible to defend against, and if one weren’t careful, one would succumb to it.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen used the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, it had a certain effect that restrained it, allowing him to injure its body. However, to kill it, just the augmentation of Primordial Energy was clearly insufficient.</p>
<p>If I could advance to the Epic stage, I could blast it apart with a punch with the augmentation of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Unfortunately, I’m still a Legendary. Zhou Wen sighed slightly as he continued sacrificing the blood-colored avatar’s life to study his opponent and think of means to kill it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had also thought of circling around it, but after doing so, he ended up encountering another one. Clearly, there were more than one or two such monsters on the battlefield. If he couldn’t think of a way to kill them now, he would definitely be unable to inch his way through the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>While he was fighting the monster, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in,” Zhou Wen said without looking up as he gamed.</p>
<p>Xu Wen walked in and frowned when she saw Zhou Wen gaming on his phone. However, she still said, “I’m Xu Wen from the medical corp. Battalion Commander Lu wanted me to come over to see if you need anything. If you need anything in the future, just let me know.”</p>
<p>“Please cook the bag of medicine on the table for me.” Zhou Wen was fighting the monster, so he was unable to divert his attention to speak to Xu Wen.</p>
<p>“You’re injured?” Xu Wen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian wanted her to take good care of Zhou Wen. If Zhou Wen was injured, she had to do something immediately.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just some supplements for blood replenishment. If it’s convenient, can you boil it? If it’s not convenient, just leave it there,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Xu Wen bit her lip and left Zhou Wen’s room without a word.</p>
<p>For Zhou Wen, who had been gaming all day in the dorm and doing nothing, to still drink such supplementary tonics left Xu Wen stupefied.</p>
<p>I really don’t know why Adjutant An brought such a good-for-nothing wastrel here. Although Xu Wen was displeased, she still found a female soldier from the medical corp to boil the medicine for Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Xu Wen glanced at the medicine—they were all rather good supplementary tonics, and she couldn’t help but curse him for being such a wastrel.</p>
<p>When She took the medicine over, Zhou Wen was still gaming. She wasn’t in the mood to bother with him, so she just left the medicine and returned to take care of the injured.</p>
<p>Recently, a large number of dimensional creatures had appeared beyond the blood river and many soldiers had been injured in battle. Xu Wen felt that it was a waste for Zhou Wen to be drinking such tonics. She believed that it should be given to the injured soldiers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know what Xu Wen was thinking. As he drank the medicine and gamed, he was once again tragically killed in the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>I wonder when Banana Fairy will finish evolving? Zhou Wen glanced at the hurricane in the chaos space. It was still spinning without any signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Once again, he dripped his blood and entered the ancient battlefield. When he met the monster again, he took a deep breath and charged forward once more.</p>
<h3 id='chapter261'>Chapter 261 Fight Poison With Poison</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen stabbed the monster, it burst into a mass of black liquid once again. Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned his pet to block it. With most of his other pets killed in action, Zhou Wen summoned the weak Doctor Darkness to block the black liquid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that Doctor Darkness would be killed instantly, but to his surprise, Doctor Darkness’s body turned black due to the virus but didn’t immediately die.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness used a certain technique and a syringe appeared in one hand. He aimed the syringe at his arm and stabbed it in.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only saw the liquid in the syringe being pushed into his body before he lost the luxury of time to look further. The monster had taken form and attacked again.</p>
<p>After dealing with him for a while, Zhou Wen was gradually left at the disadvantage. At that moment, he realized that the Doctor Darkness had rushed over to help him in combat. The scalpel in his hand shimmered with a thin blade beam. Although it was useless, it left Zhou Wen somewhat astonished.</p>
<p>Even the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and the Golden-Armored Beast couldn’t withstand the terrifying poison after they made contact with the black liquid. Even if they turned into armor, they would still be corroded.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness’s body wasn’t as strong as the Golden Warrior and Gold-Armored Beast; yet, he still survived after making contact with the black liquid. Furthermore, after a short period of time, he became energetic and lively. It was as if he had never been injured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t a match for the monster, so he was quickly forced to block the black liquid that splattered out from the monster’s body. This time, Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness to help him block it. To his surprise, Doctor Darkness became even stronger this time. His body was stained with the black liquid, only to turn black from contact and then quickly recover their rosy colors.</p>
<p>Apart from the corrosion of his flesh, he didn’t suffer any damage from the virus.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen very surprised. Although the black liquid on the monster’s body was highly corrosive, it wasn’t lethal enough. Zhou Wen still had a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>However, the virus in the black liquid was something Zhou Wen was unable to defend against. He was basically killed by the virus every time.</p>
<p>Yet, Doctor Darkness was immune to it and seemed to have adequate resistance against the corrosive forces of the black liquid.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was so surprised, that moment of distraction allowed one drop of the monster’s black liquid to splatter onto him.</p>
<p>Black gas immediately arose from the blood-colored avatar’s body as it rapidly expanded. Zhou Wen knew something was amiss as he suddenly recalled the scene of Doctor Darkness stabbing himself with a syringe. He immediately thought of something</p>
<p>“Doctor Darkness, use Fight Poison With Poison.” Zhou Wen gave the order. Without any hesitation, Doctor Darkness carried out Zhou Wen’s order. A syringe appeared in his hand and stabbed the blood-colored avatar’s body, injecting the poison into the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately felt a spasming pain spread throughout his body, but the pain slowed the spreading speed of the monster’s virus, preventing him from dying as quickly as before.</p>
<p>It actually works! Zhou Wen was only giving it a try, he never expected it to be that effective. Although the pain was intense, he didn’t die.</p>
<p>However, the poison could only temporarily withstand the virus and prevent the virus from spreading within his body. It had not been eliminated.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Doctor Darkness isn’t afraid of the virus solely because of Fight Poison With Poison. It has a lot to do with his own physique and Life Providence. Zhou Wen persisted for a while longer before being sprayed by the black liquid once again. The virus in his body exceeded the poison that Doctor Darkness had injected into him, and the virus began to spread again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got Doctor Darkness to inject him with more poison using Fight Poison With Poison.</p>
<p>After injecting two batches of poison, the virus in Zhou Wen’s body was stabilized again. However, the poison that Doctor Darkness had injected was extremely stimulating for his body. It made Zhou Wen feel pain as if he was being pricked by needles and he nearly stumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>The blood-colored avatar was ultimately killed. It was not that the monster had ripped off his head, but that he had made contact with some more of the black liquid. After injecting the poison again, the blood-colored avatar could no longer take it physically.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Fight Poison With Poison cannot be used constantly. After injecting more than a certain amount of poison, it will cause tremendous damage to the body. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he originally imagined that he had found a way to deal with the monster. From the looks of it, it was only temporary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Doctor Darkness’s resistance to the virus was getting higher and higher. He could actually ignore the virus of the blood rain and the monster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still at the Legendary stage and had few combat skills. The monster could easily rip its head off. Otherwise, with his abilities, he would have perfectly countered such monsters.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness was an Epic in the first place. It was only because Zhou Wen had insufficient Primordial Energy in his incubation that he had fallen to the Legendary stage. When he evolved into a mature body, he might be able to restrain that monster.</p>
<p>Although he had such thoughts, Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for Doctor Darkness to evolve into his mature form in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The abilities of Doctor Darkness allowed Zhou Wen to gain the ability to circle around the monster a little more. However, Fight Poison With Poison was just too painful. His organs felt like they were being pricked by needles, something ordinary people would find difficult to tolerate.</p>
<p>After injecting the poison a few times, Zhou Wen discovered something strange. Doctor Darkness’s Fight Poison With Poison seemed to have more resistant traits against the virus.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Zhou Wen had needed an injection after making contact with one or two drops of black liquid. However, after a few times, Zhou Wen discovered that Doctor Darkness needed very little poison to put the virus at bay. Furthermore, its restraining effects were improving.</p>
<p>He’s growing? The virus here has made Doctor Darkness rapidly grow? Zhou Wen immediately understood what was happening.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen realized this, he consciously allowed Doctor Darkness to come into contact with even more poison. The blood rain which was everywhere and the black liquid on the monster’s body were all candidates to be his nutrients.</p>
<p>As the poison that Doctor Darkness came into contact with increased, his resistance towards the virus increased. Apart from his physical traits being inferior to the monster, he eventually became immune to the monster’s virus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his usage of Fight Poison With Poison became more and more effective. As a result, one injection from Doctor Darkness after the blood-colored avatar made contact with a few drops of black liquid ended up being an overdose, causing the blood-colored avatar to be poisoned to death.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen once again came in front of the monster. When Doctor Darkness helped him block the black liquid, the system suddenly produced a notification: ‘Doctor Darkness has reached the growth requirement and evolved into a mature body.’</p>
<p>Following the system’s notification, a strange change occurred to Doctor Darkness’s body. White streams of light emitted from his body. The white doctor robe flared up with the streams of light as a terrifying aura erupted from him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter262'>Chapter 262 Returning to the Epic Stage</h3>
<p>Light arose from Doctor Darkness’s body, forming a shadow projection of a doctor over his head. It was none other than the Dr. Soul Life Soul which Zhou Wen had seen before.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster charge at him again, Doctor Darkness raised the scalpel in his hand while Dr. Soul moved as well. He held the scalpel formed from light and stabbed it into the monster.</p>
<p>The monster’s originally running body seemed to be nailed to the ground as it stopped moving.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted. He knew that Doctor Darkness had returned to the Epic stage. He finally had a powerful fighter who could be used.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>However, the monster’s body turned into black liquid and exploded. Dr. Soul pinning him down with the scalpel shadow had instantly lost its effect.</p>
<p>However, the black liquid of the monster was useless against Doctor Darkness. It once again condensed into a monster and in an instant, it was behind Doctor Darkness. It wanted to twist Doctor Darkness’s head off with its advantage of speed.</p>
<p>But now, Doctor Darkness had evolved to the Epic stage and he could keep up. With a slight flash of his body, he managed to dodge its hands. At the same time, the scalpel in his left hand flashed rapidly, slicing across the monster’s body continuously.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the scalpel diced the monster’s body into several pieces.</p>
<p>However, the monster’s body was not affected at all. It quickly merged into one and pounced towards Doctor Darkness once again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen became a bystander in the battle between the two Epic creatures. Taking this opportunity, he glanced at the information of Doctor Darkness after his evolution.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Golden Left Hand</p>
<p>Life Soul: Dr. Soul</p>
<p>Strength: 27</p>
<p>Speed: 40</p>
<p>Constitution: 29</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 39</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Scalpel, Fight Poison With Poison, Light of Penetration</p>
<p>Companion Form: Soul</p>
<p>It was somewhat different from the original Epic Doctor Darkness’s attributes. The four basic stats had increased, but they were still mainly concentrated on Speed and Primordial Energy. This was not much of a change.</p>
<p>The biggest transformation was his companion form. Doctor Darkness didn’t have a companion form previously, but he did now. Zhou Wen didn’t quite understand what a soul companion form was.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was thinking about this, he suddenly saw a strange light shoot out from Doctor Darkness’s eyes. Dr. Soul’s eyes lit up as well. With that, four beams shone on the monster’s body, overlapping each other like a spotlight, illuminating the monster’s body.</p>
<p>The beam of light didn’t have any lethality. Zhou Wen knew that it was likely the Light of Penetration skill of Doctor Darkness, but he didn’t know how effective it was.</p>
<p>In the next second, Doctor Darkness moved. He held the scalpel in his left hand and disappeared like a magic trick. He was incredibly fast as he moved the scalpel with almost indiscernible trajectories.</p>
<p>The monster that flew towards him was stabbed in the waist.</p>
<p>This time, the monster didn’t explode into black liquid. Zhou Wen thought he heard something shatter inside its body. In the next second, the monster took a few steps back and exploded, turning into a pool of black liquid. However, this time, he wasn’t reborn again. Instead, he slowly merged into the mud, leaving only a crystal behind.</p>
<p>A notification popped up in the game: ‘Killed Epic creature, Wangliang. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the crystal’s name clearly. The dimensional crystal was different from what he had seen before.</p>
<p>The small black crystal’s size wasn’t obvious in-game. He estimated it to be about the size of a quail egg, but its name was a little odd.</p>
<p>Poison Crystal: 7</p>
<p>Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the virus crystal, and the game system immediately asked if he wanted to absorb it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen chose to absorb it and soon, a strange force fused into his body. Then, he looked at the blood-colored avatar’s attributes and realized that its stats had changed from four different types to five. The new attribute was Poison, and its value was seven.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Epic matters, he didn’t know what the Poison stat was for either.</p>
<p>However, he soon discovered that he had obtained quite a lot of benefits after obtaining a seven-valued Poison stat. This was because he could directly withstand the blood rain and not be reduced to a lunatic by the poison.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Poison stat gives me quite a good viral immunity. However, I still need to further test how strong this resistance is. Zhou Wen was in a good mood as he continued walking forward with Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>He had already wasted too much time here. He had to rush to the ruins as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After walking for more than half a kilometer, a monster appeared in front of him. Zhou Wen originally imagined that it was a Wangliang, but upon careful inspection, something was amiss.</p>
<p>The monster that appeared wasn’t a Wangliang, but rather, a very strange creature. The creature’s head looked like a wyrm with no horns on its head. Its body was like a lion’s, its tail like a crocodile’s. Its body was also covered in crocodile-like skin.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. The one I killed previously was a Wangliang. Could this be the Chi from ChiMeiWangliang?</p>
<p>It was common to use the term ChiMeiWangliang to describe monsters of the mountains and rivers in the East District. Even if one didn’t recognize the word, most people in the East District could guess that this phrase was used to describe all kinds of bad people. And with these four words all having the “ghost” radical in their characters, it meant a kind of ghost or monster.</p>
<p>Based on what Zhou Wen knew, the term “ChiMeiWangliang” represented three types of monsters. Wangliang referred to the ghost of plagues according to legend. There were also tales that he was one of the legendary Five Emperors of ancient times—Zhuan Xu’s third son that had drowned to death.</p>
<p>Although it was a tale and couldn’t be taken seriously, since a Wangliang had appeared, such a strange creature in front of him might just be the Chi of ChiMeiWangliang</p>
<p>This was because the legendary Mei, or succubus, was a ghost found in mountains and forests. It was a wood spirit that didn’t match the monster’s image in front of him. On the other hand, it was a beast-like ghost. There were also tales that it was one of the nine sons of the dragon. It did resemble the monster in front of him.</p>
<p>However, these were tales. They might not be the same as the dimensional creature in front of him.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster rushing over, Zhou Wen ordered Doctor Darkness to charge forward. Dr. Soul also condensed a scalpel made of light as he stabbed the glimmering weapon at the monster.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The monster let out a roar as black flames burst out from its body, transforming it into a Life Soul that was in the form of a black dragon. Without waiting for Dr. Soul to react, it swallowed him in one bite.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Doctor Darkness cried out in pain. A powerhouse’s pain of having a Life Soul devoured was an excruciating pain that was akin to having his heart dug out.</p>
<p>While Doctor Darkness was in pain, the monster pounced on him and swallowed him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and circled to the back of the monster with Ghost Steps, stabbing its soft waist with his Overlord Spear.</p>
<p>However, before Overlord Spear could stab into the monster’s waist, the black dragon-resembling Life Soul spewed out black smoke at the blood-colored avatar. This resembled a volcanic eruption as it enveloped the blood-colored avatar’s body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter263'>Chapter 263 Battlefield Ruins</h3>
<p>Without a word, Zhou Wen summoned his Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell and aimed it at the black smoke.</p>
<p>The black smoke seemed to be sucked away as it surged into the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell. In the blink of an eye, it was sucked clean.</p>
<p>The monster seemed somewhat puzzled as it stared at the Yin-Yang Purple Air Bell with its strange eyes. Zhou Wen held the bell and shook it at the monster.</p>
<p>Black smoke immediately gushed out from the bell, enveloping the monster’s body. When the black smoke touched its scales, it immediately seeped in. The monster’s eyes rolled back as it collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, is this black smoke that powerful? It even poisoned the monster to death? Zhou Wen was alarmed but upon closer inspection, he realized that the monster hadn’t died. It had only fallen asleep.</p>
<p>The monster had fallen asleep and its Life Soul seemed to lose control. It floated above its head motionlessly.</p>
<p>How could Zhou Wen miss such a good opportunity? He charged forward with the Overlord Spear in hand and stabbed the monster in the abdomen.</p>
<p>Ever-Victorious showed its effects as the tip of the spear stabbed into the monster’s abdomen. A hole was torn open in the monster’s abdomen and black blood immediately flowed out.</p>
<p>It was unknown what the black smoke’s strength was, but after having such a huge hole stabbed through, the monster didn’t react at all despite bleeding excessively. It continued sleeping soundly, leaving Zhou Wen astonished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t going to be merciful with it. He stabbed it again and again, stabbing at it for a total of 18 times before the monster was finally dead. The black dragon-like Life Soul also shattered.</p>
<p>A notification popped up in-game: ‘Killed the Epic creature, Chi. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’</p>
<p>Zhou Wen saw that the dimensional crystal that dropped was a Strength Crystal with 32 points. Although its value was very high to him, Zhou Wen’s limit was at 21. It was useless no matter how good it was.</p>
<p>After absorbing the 32-valued Strength Crystal, Zhou Wen felt that he was brimming with strength. His earlier fatigue was wiped clean, but his Strength stat didn’t increase. It remained at 21 points.</p>
<p>Since the Wangliang and Chi have appeared, there should be a Mei. I wonder what kind of creature the Mei is. Zhou Wen was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>However, he was not that bored to the point of deliberately searching for the Mei. He headed for the ruins through the blood rain before he encountered another Wangliang.</p>
<p>With a Dark Doctor to restrain it, it was rather easy to kill it. However, it didn’t drop any Poison Crystals and only dropped an ordinary Speed crystal. It was useless for Zhou Wen now.</p>
<p>As he charged towards the ruins, he encountered several Wangliang and Chi. However, he didn’t see the Mei, nor did anything useful drop.</p>
<p>After battling the entire night, Zhou Wen finally arrived at the spot where the map marked the ruins.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in a rush to get the blood-colored avatar to walk over when he saw the broken stone pillars and the stone walls that stood in the middle of the blood rain not far away. Instead, he took the information An Sheng had handed out before leaving and carefully read it again. According to the information, the League had sent a few more groups of people to the ruins to find Ouyang Ting and the others.</p>
<p>However, when they entered the ruins, they died for no explicable reason. Even Epic experts were no exception. Until now, they had not found the reason.</p>
<p>It was also because of this that they felt that the former principal and the others were already dead inside. Hence, they didn’t send any more search and rescue teams. Help came only when the An family received the news.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen observed the ruins from afar, hoping to find any clues no matter how minute. However, there were ancient symbols on them that he couldn’t decipher. No matter how he looked at them, he couldn’t tell anything</p>
<p>I’ll still have to risk my life to scout the way. Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness and Ghost Bride. Together with Three-Eyed Golden Warrior and Gold-Armored Beast, they entered the ruins as the blood-colored avatar remained outside.</p>
<p>Golden Warrior and Gold-Armored Beast were pets with powerful bodies, while Ghost Bride had the body of a ghost. Doctor Darkness was an Epic pet, so Zhou Wen wanted to see who would die among them. Through this, he could determine how terrifying the powers were inside.</p>
<p>The four pets carefully walked into the ruins and slowly explored.</p>
<p>After walking for a short distance, a cracking sound was heard as the Golden Warrior’s head flew up from his neck as he died instantly.</p>
<p>Just like what was written in the information. Dying from a beheading. Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Although he had read it very carefully, he didn’t see any creatures appear. Nor did he notice any power fluctuations. It was as though an invisible executioner had cleaved off the Golden Warrior’s head.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, Doctor Darkness’s head fell to the ground and he died on the spot. He didn’t put up any resistance just because he was an Epic creature. His death was equally clean.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen still couldn’t see what was in the ruin. He couldn’t even tell how Doctor Darkness died.</p>
<p>Not long later, Gold-Armored Beast suffered the same fate. Similarly, it had no chance to react. It died quickly, and in less than thirty minutes, Zhou Wen’s three Companion Beasts, including the Epic Doctor Darkness, had been killed silently. Only Ghost Bride remained floating forward.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride continued forward for a while, but her head wasn’t chopped off. This delighted Zhou Wen. It looks like that power is ineffective against ghosts.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare enter, but with Ghost Bride around, she could scout the path for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further as he sped her up. He began his carpet search of the ruins, hoping to discover something.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the power in the ruins was too terrifying that even ChiMeiWangliang didn’t appear. There was only a dead silence. Apart from the blood rain outside, all that was left were those decrepit ancient buildings.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled Ghost Bride to get her to search for clues in all sorts of rundown buildings.</p>
<p>This was a game, so he definitely couldn’t find the former principal and company here. However, it was impossible for them to vanish into thin air. They must have gone somewhere. All Zhou Wen wanted to do was find the place.</p>
<p>At the encampment, the soldiers guarding the door suddenly saw someone in front of them rushing over like madmen. They hurriedly raised their rifles.</p>
<p>“Halt. Don’t move any further, or else we’ll shoot.” A soldier hurriedly warned when he saw that the person was charging over.</p>
<p>However, that person didn’t stop and continued running like a madman.</p>
<p>Just as the soldier was about to deliver a warning shot, he suddenly realized that the person was wearing the same military uniform as them. However, because he was covered in blood, most of the parts of his military uniform had turned dark red.</p>
<p>“It’s Liu Chengzhi… Didn’t he follow Madam Lan to the ancient battlefield? Why is he running back alone? Where’s Madam Lan and the rest?” One of the soldiers took a closer look and instantly recognized who that person was. He was shocked and quickly went forward to welcome him.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi, who was covered in blood, pounced over when he saw the two of them. The two soldiers quickly held him up.</p>
<p>“Quick… Quick, tell Adjutant An… Madam is in danger… Save her immediately… If there’s any delay, it’ll be too late…” Liu Chengzhi said anxiously as he coughed out blood.</p>
<h3 id='chapter264'>Chapter 264 Tunnel Ruins</h3>
<p>“Liu Chengzhi, what happened?” Lu Yunxian asked as he looked at Liu Chengzhi, who was being treated on a sickbed.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi’s injuries were horrifying. Under the treatment of a Companion Beast with healing abilities, his life was saved. However, his injuries still required a longer period of treatment.</p>
<p>“Commander, quickly tell Adjutant An that Madam Lan is trapped in the ruins. Quickly send someone to help her. It will be too late if we delay any longer,” Liu Chengzhi said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An entered the ancient ruins two days ago. Didn’t you encounter them?” Xu Wen asked.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi was stunned when he heard that. He shook his head and said, “Adjutant An has already entered the ruins? Why didn’t I see them? I escaped from the ruins and rushed back with all my might, but I didn’t see anyone.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Tell me clearly what happened to Madam Lan,” Lu Yun asked first.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi hurriedly said, “We entered the ancient battlefield with Madam Lan and encountered many strange things. However, under Madam Lan’s lead, we managed to arrive at the ruins where Old Mr. Ouyang and the rest studied without any mishaps. That place had already become extremely bizarre. Many of our Companion Beasts were beheaded there. Finally, Madam Lan came up with a way to safely enter the ruins.”</p>
<p>Due to the excessive loss of blood, Liu Chengzhi felt a little thirsty as he swallowed his saliva before continuing, “In the ruins, we found an entrance that leads underground. There was also a mark left behind by Old Mr. Ouyang. In the beginning, we used many of our Companion Beasts to scout the area, but nothing happened. However, when Madam Lan led the group down, the entrance to the passageway was sealed. The few of us who stayed outside did all we could to open the stone door.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Xu Wen pressed.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi panted a few times before continuing, “Three hours later, the stone door at the entrance opened automatically and Old Qiu rushed out. By then, old Qiu was covered in blood and I almost couldn’t see the color of his military uniform. He rushed over and directly handed me a strange stone artifact. In a very urgent tone, he told me to pass the stone artifact to Adjutant An and get Adjutant An to lead men into the ruins to save Madam Lan or it would be too late. He was in such a hurry that he spoke in a delirious manner. He said that the stone artifact is a key that opens some doors. The stone artifact needs to be returned before the door can be opened to save Madam Lan. We have to be fast, or it will be too late. He kept repeating himself, and the few people we left guarding the spot couldn’t say a word. Just as they were about to ask questions, Old Qiu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood and passed away.”</p>
<p>“What about the stone artifact?” Lu Yunxian asked.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi wore a look of guilt. “Even people like Madam Lan and Old Qiu were unable to deal with the situation in the stone passageway, so it would be impossible for us to do so. After our discussion, we planned on returning with the stone artifact and report the situation. However, the ancient battlefield is simply too terrifying. A few of our brothers died while I barely survived. The stone artifact was swallowed by a dimensional creature with a wyrm’s head and a lion’s body along the way. It’s all my fault for not being able to hold onto it…”</p>
<p>“Do you still remember where that dimensional creature is?” Lu Yunxian asked after some thought.</p>
<p>“I roughly know the location, but I wonder if the dimensional creature is still there,” Liu Chengzhi said.</p>
<p>“Alright, Xu Wen, do your best to treat Liu Chengzhi’s injuries. Everyone else, prepare to be on standby. Prepare to set off anytime,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, since Adjutant An has already gone, it probably won’t be of much use for us to enter, right?” a middle-aged officer asked.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian said, “When Liu Chengzhi and company returned, they didn’t encounter Adjutant An. Therefore, even if Adjutant An reached the ruins, he wouldn’t know of the stone artifact’s existence, much less know that it has been swallowed by a dimensional creature. We have to deliver it to him.”</p>
<p>“We can’t do much, but killing a dimensional creature shouldn’t be difficult. Furthermore, Liu Chengzhi is still familiar with the situation. There shouldn’t be any major problems. Go and prepare,” said Lu Yunxian in a tone that didn’t allow for doubts.</p>
<p>Right now, Lu Yunxian was the highest-ranking officer. Since he had already decided, no one doubted him. They went back to prepare to enter the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>Xu Wen also wanted to go, but Lu Yunxian rejected her request. Lu Yunxian wanted her to stay behind to take care of Zhou Wen, to ensure that nothing happened to him.</p>
<p>“Commander, just let me go. My healing abilities can reduce the number of casualties. Zhou Wen can just be taken off by the female soldiers at the medical corp,” Xu Wen requested once again.</p>
<p>“Stay behind to take care of Zhou Wen. That’s an order. If anything happens to him, you will be court-martialed. There’s absolutely no room for negotiation,” Lu Yunxian said firmly.</p>
<p>He had said it in a relaxed manner earlier, but he knew that the ancient battlefield was very dangerous. They would be placed in grave danger by heading in, and he didn’t want Xu Wen to take the risk.</p>
<p>Xu Wen opened her mouth but was at a loss for words. She was a soldier, so she could only obey Lu Yunxian’s orders. However, she felt extremely indignant.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was gaming in his room, but he wore the Truth Listener earring at all times, so he could clearly hear the sounds nearby.</p>
<p>When Liu Chengzhi returned, the place was a little far from where Zhou Wen bunked. Zhou Wen didn’t hear it, but when Lu Yunxian and the others prepared to set off, he heard the commotion.</p>
<p>When he came out to take a look, Lu Yunxian and the rest had already boarded their vehicles and set off. Two jeeps and a huge truck were driving out of the camp.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen realized what had happened. Seeing Xu Wen standing at the entrance of the camp, he walked over and asked, “Head Nurse Xu, what happened? Where are Commander Lu and the rest going?”</p>
<p>“Why are you asking so much? Do you dare to go to the ancient battlefield to rescue lives? Go back and play your game,” Xu Wen snapped.</p>
<p>Xu Wen believed that if it wasn’t for Zhou Wen, she wouldn’t have been left behind.</p>
<p>“Rescue lives in the ancient battlefield? Who are they going to rescue? Ouyang Lan or An Sheng?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business who’s being rescued.” Xu Wen didn’t wish to say much to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He knew how dangerous the ancient battlefield was, which was why the An family had invited so many Epic experts from outside. However, if Commander Lu and those low-ranking officers were to enter the ancient battlefield, it was basically equivalent to sending themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>“Head Nurse Xu, I believe you still don’t know that Ouyang Lan is actually my mother, right? I hope you can understand my feelings and tell me what happened,” Zhou Wen said when he saw that Xu Wen wasn’t willing to tell him what had happened.</p>
<p>“Who are you lying to? Madam Lan only has two children-Overseer and Miss An Jing. Do you think you’re the Overseer? Or Miss An Jing?” Xu Wen said with a pout.</p>
<p>“You should know about Ouyang Lan’s remarriage, right? I’m her new husband’s son. Who do you think I am to her?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Xu Wen looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.</p>
<h3 id='chapter265'>Chapter 265 Heading to the Ruins</h3>
<p>“If it wasn’t for my identity, why do you think An Sheng wants all of you to take care of me?” Seeing Xu Wen’s hesitation, Zhou Wen went against his conscience and said, “My relationship with Ouyang Lan is very good, just like a biological mother and son. My concern for her is definitely no less than the An siblings. Can you tell me what happened?”</p>
<p>Xu Wen hesitated for a moment. Believing that it wasn’t much of a secret, she recounted the entire incident to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen heard that, he turned and walked out of the camp.</p>
<p>Although Lu Yunxian was an Epic expert, he didn’t have many capable people under him. The low-level officers he had taken were basically at the Legendary stage. With their abilities, it was too difficult to deal with the dimensional creatures on the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>Their survival had nothing to do with Zhou Wen, but if they couldn’t retrieve the stone artifact, Ouyang Lan might very well die. It might even be possible that the former principal was also in the underground stone passageway, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to retrieve it.</p>
<p>“Hey, where are you going?” Xu Wen hurriedly chased after Zhou Wen when she saw him heading outside the camp.</p>
<p>“I’ll help Commander Lu and the rest retrieve the stone artifact,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Stop fooling around. You’re just a student. Why are you messing around?” Xu Wen hurriedly stopped Zhou Wen. Lu Yunxian wanted her to watch over Zhou Wen, so she couldn’t let him do anything rash.</p>
<p>“Head Nurse Xu, you are the highest commander of the medical corp and also the best doctor. Why didn’t you participate in this operation?” Zhou Wen asked Xu Wen.</p>
<p>Xu Wen snorted and said, “It’s all because of you. If it wasn’t for the fact that I had to stay and take care of you, I would have definitely gone. So you should stay here obediently and stop causing trouble.”</p>
<p>“Then are you really not going? The ancient battlefield is fraught with danger. As the best medical personnel here, how can you stay behind and watch helplessly as your comrades die without doing anything? Comrades who can clearly live but will have to die because you weren’t there. Can you really be at ease?” Zhou Wen stared at Xu Wen as he clearly enunciated each word.</p>
<p>Xu Wen’s expression changed slightly, but she still said, “Whatever you say is useless. We must stay in the camp and not go anywhere. Otherwise, I won’t be able to answer to Commander Lu, Adjutant An, and Madam Lan.”</p>
<p>“Commander Lu got you to protect me, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Xu Wen nodded.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say that I can’t leave the military camp, right?” Zhou Wen asked again.</p>
<p>“Well…” Xu Wen hesitated.</p>
<p>“Since he didn’t say that I’m not allowed to go, and he wants you to protect me, that means that you will be going wherever I go, right?” Zhou Wen added.</p>
<p>Xu Wen was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Then, do you want to go or not?” Zhou Wen stared at Xu Wen with a burning gaze.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t let you take the risk…” Xu Wen struggled internally.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the blood river to take a look. We won’t cross it. Waiting here is just too torturous. You wish to wait somewhere nearby, right?” Zhou Wen said with a sincere look.</p>
<p>“Well…” Xu Wen was still very hesitant.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I have to take a look. It’s up to you to decide if you want to go.” Zhou Wen walked around Xu Wen and walked towards the camp’s entrance.</p>
<p>Xu Wen gritted her teeth but didn’t stop Zhou Wen as she chased him out of the camp.</p>
<p>Xu Wen felt that a spoiled fellow like Zhou Wen, who stayed cooped up inside the encampment and ate supplementary tonics, definitely didn’t have the guts to enter the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>The main reason she agreed was that she was also feeling anxious. If she were to continue waiting in the encampment, she would feel too uneasy. In fact, she wanted to go more than Zhou Wen. His words had already shaken her resolve.</p>
<p>“How long do you think walking will take? Come on up.” Xu Wen summoned a white lion. It was extremely majestic and was even taller than a horse.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally wanted to summon his mount, but his mount wasn’t very fast. It wasn’t as fast as he ran, so it was useless.</p>
<p>Seeing Xu Wen’s white lion running quite quickly, Zhou Wen jumped up and sat behind her.</p>
<p>Xu Wen ordered the white lion to run at full speed and chased in the direction that Commander Lu and the rest had gone.</p>
<p>“Don’t go too fast,” Zhou Wen suddenly said to Xu Wen.</p>
<p>Xu Wen was slightly taken aback before she understood what Zhou Wen meant. If they ran too quickly and ended up catching up with Commander Lu and company, they would definitely be chased back.</p>
<p>Xu Wen grunted. When she saw the troops from afar, she slowed down a little.</p>
<p>Xu Wen steered the white lion in front while Zhou Wen continued gaming. Ghost Bride had found the tunnel and stone steps in the ruins.</p>
<p>However, there seemed to be some terrifying power inside that made Ghost Bride hesitate.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that Ghost Bride must have sensed something, but unfortunately, she couldn’t express it. Zhou Wen could only vaguely sense that she was afraid of something and didn’t dare enter the passageway.</p>
<p>Since Ghost Bride didn’t dare enter, Zhou Wen had no choice but to think of a way to enter. Ouyang Lan and the former principal might be trapped inside. Even if he didn’t enter in the future, he knew that An Sheng would definitely enter. If he could find out ahead of time what danger was inside, he could warn An Sheng so reducing their sacrifices and giving them a greater chance of rescuing Ouyang Lan and the former principal.</p>
<p>What kind of power does the beheading in the ruins? Zhou Wen had already restarted the game a few times and had thought of many methods, but he still couldn’t figure out what kind of power it was.</p>
<p>Even Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration couldn’t detect any problems in the ruins.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before turning Doctor Darkness into his companion form. He saw that Doctor Darkness’s body transformed into a beam of light that clung onto the blood-colored avatar like an illusion.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he realized that in the blood-colored avatar’s skill column, there were skills—Scalpel, Fight Poison With Poison, and Light of Penetration.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness’s soul state actually imbued his powers on the master, allowing the master to use them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to head to the ruins again. Soon, he encountered a Wangliang.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew how Doctor Darkness killed Wangliangs, so he activated Light of Penetration and shot a beam at it.</p>
<p>Under the Light of Penetration, the Wangliang’ body seemed to turn transparent</p>
<p>-all the meridians and organs within could be seen clearly. Zhou Wen immediately saw a tiny black bead rapidly flowing within the Wangliang. The bead was only the size of a rice grain and was extremely inconspicuous. It moved at an extremely fast speed, like a cardiograph. Furthermore, it didn’t have any pattern, making it difficult to capture its trajectory.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood how to kill the Wangliang.</p>
<p>With the Ghost Steps activated, Zhou Wen instantly appeared behind the Wangliang. With Scalpel, a white beam of light condensed into a scalpel and instantly pierced through the Wangliang’s body and struck the beating bead.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>As soon as the bead broke apart, the Wangliang’s body collapsed into a pool of black liquid that sprayed onto the ground. The game also gave the notification that he had killed an Epic Wangliang.</p>
<p>As long as I can understand the abilities and weaknesses of an Epic creature, it’s not impossible for me to kill them with my present strength. Zhou Wen increasingly felt the importance of knowing himself as well as the enemy.</p>
<h3 id='chapter266'>Chapter 266 Are You Nuts?</h3>
<p>Both banks of the blood river were two completely different worlds. On one side, the weather was perfect while on the other side, there was a bloody storm that stretched for thousands of kilometers. Mountains and rivers were dyed with blood, as though they were in hell.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen and Xu Wen arrived at the blood riverbank, Lu Yunxian had already led the officers across the river.</p>
<p>“Head Nurse Xu, why are you here?” A low-ranking officer who was staying behind quickly greeted Xu Wen when he saw her.</p>
<p>“It’s a little unsettling to stay in the garrison. Let’s just wait here for Commander Lu and the rest to return,” Xu Wen said as she sized up the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Although she felt that she shouldn’t cross the river and had to obey orders and take care of Zhou Wen, she couldn’t help but look inside the car, hoping to find the remaining custom raincoats.</p>
<p>Without the custom raincoat, one wasn’t able to move an inch in the blood rain. Upon contact with the raindrops, they would become lunatics. Entering would be suicide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the number of custom raincoats was limited. Ouyang Lan and An Sheng had taken two batches away one after another. There weren’t many left after that. Lu Yunxian and the others had only obtained about ten sets, so only about ten people had crossed the river. The others could only wait here to receive them.</p>
<p>Without any custom raincoat left, Xu Wen felt extremely disappointed. It was impossible for her to even think about crossing the river now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood by the blood river and looked at the blood rain with mixed emotions. Before he came to Zhuolu, he believed that he definitely wouldn’t enter the ancient battlefield. All he needed to do was game outside and provide some help.</p>
<p>But now, he had to cross the river and enter that terrifying place personally.</p>
<p>I hope there’s no need to use the words left behind by Teacher. Zhou Wen didn’t think it would be too dangerous. He had already gained a better understanding of the ancient battlefield in-game. As long as he didn’t enter the ruins, there wouldn’t be too much danger.</p>
<p>“Do you have any more raincoats left?” Zhou Wen asked the officer.</p>
<p>Xu Wen said, “The number of raincoats we have is too limited. There wasn’t enough for Commander Lu and the rest, so how can there be any left? Don’t think too much. Just wait here for Commander Lu and the rest to return. With Commander Lu and Adjutant An’s abilities, they will definitely be able to save Madam Lan and Old Mr. Ouyang and return safely with them.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stood by the blood river and looked at the other side of the river before saying slowly, “You’re right. Ah Sheng and company are both excellent. Perhaps they can return safely.”</p>
<p>With that said, Zhou Wen paused for a moment as the luster in his eyes gradually turned sharp. Then, he said, “Unfortunately, I’m a person who doesn’t like gambling. I can’t sit here and wait for the needle of a wheel of fortune to stop. I can’t watch the needle waver between luckiness and unluckiness. I want to control the needle and wheel and make them stop at the position I want.”</p>
<p>The more Xu Wen processed what he said, the more she felt that something was amiss. Just as her expression changed slightly and she was about to say something, she saw Zhou Wen run towards the blood river, his body wrapped in black armor. In a few steps, he reached the edge of the river bank and leaped up, flitting across the river.</p>
<p>Xu Wen and company were shocked. Without any hesitation, Xu Wen reached out and grabbed an umbrella beside her. At the same time, she summoned a strange bird that was shimmering with lightning. The strange lightning bird transformed into a pair of wings and landed behind her.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen was wearing armor, the armor couldn’t protect his entire body, so there would still be blood rain touching him. To Xu Wen, Zhou Wen’s actions were akin to having a death wish.</p>
<p>The lightning wings on Xu Wen’s back flapped as she instantly streaked across the sky like a bolt of lightning. She caught up with Zhou Wen who was about to enter the blood rain. She grabbed his shoulder and opened the umbrella to block the falling rain.</p>
<p>“Are you nuts?” Zhou Wen looked at Xu Wen in puzzlement.</p>
<p>It was impossible for the umbrella to block all the blood rain. Furthermore, Xu Wen was mainly using the umbrella to cover Zhou Wen’s body, so many blood rain droplets splattered onto her body.</p>
<p>Although she had already summoned her armor-type Companion Beast to protect her, she was unable to envelop her entire body with it. A few raindrops of blood splattered onto her cheeks.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t understand why Xu Wen would do that. She had nothing to do with him, and she didn’t even seem to like him. Yet, she had risked her life to rush over. This was something Zhou Wen couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“You are the one who’s nuts. Go back with me.” Xu Wen grabbed Zhou Wen and exerted her strength with her wings, trying to fly back to the other side.</p>
<p>However, she still underestimated the blood rain’s infectious ability. In an instant, her eyes turned red, as though they were about to drip blood. Her consciousness suddenly blurred as she nearly caused Xu Wen to fall into the blood river.</p>
<p>With just a tiny bit of rationality left, Xu Wen threw Zhou Wen across the river as she landed by the side of the river of blood. She stood motionless in the rain with an umbrella in hand, knowing that she couldn’t return.</p>
<p>“Just wait patiently for Commander Lu and the rest to come back. You’re not a child anymore. Don’t always give others trouble. No one can keep protecting you.” Xu Wen’s voice gradually turned hoarse, and her eyes gradually turned ferocious. Blood had already begun to flow out of them.</p>
<p>“B*stard… You b*stard…” When the officer on the other side saw this scene, he felt like tearing Zhou Wen apart as he roared angrily.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in the air as he looked at Xu Wen with an odd expression. He was an emotionally indifferent person, so he couldn’t understand why Xu Wen would do such a thing for a stranger she didn’t like. But at that moment, he didn’t want her to die.</p>
<p>As though stepping on empty space, his body circled around like a bird. In midair, he charged towards the opposite bank like an arrow, shooting towards Xu Wen, who was holding an umbrella.</p>
<p>When Xu Wen saw Zhou Wen returning in midair again, she wanted to say something, but her consciousness turned blurry as violent emotions filled her mind.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p>Xu Wen only wanted to kill and see blood. Any living thing in her eyes appeared filthy to her. It was as if only killing and blood could make her feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>She threw the umbrella in her hand and allowed it to fall to the ground. Pressing her palms together as the pair of wings behind her crackled with lightning, she struck out with both her hands as though she was enveloped by lightning. A lightning beam then shot towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>The officers on the other side watched as this scene unfolded, but they could not do anything. The distress drove them nuts.</p>
<p>From their point of view, Zhou Wen was definitely doomed facing such an attack from Xu Wen in midair. Even if he was lucky to not die from the attack, he would end up like Xu Wen the moment he landed in the blood river.</p>
<p>The azure lightning snaked at Zhou Wen as if it was about to swallow him.</p>
<p>However, in everyone’s line of sight, Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly blurred as he vanished into thin air, leaving the officers stunned.</p>
<p>By the time they saw Zhou Wen again, they realized that he was already standing on the other side of the river. He was standing behind Xu Wen, emitting a faint white light. He held onto the umbrella that was about to fall to the ground with one hand and holding something in his other hand. He then stabbed Xu Wen directly in the neck.</p>
<p>The red-eyed Xu Wen immediately turned limp as Zhou Wen held an umbrella in one hand and held Xu Wen in the other. He leaped into the air and returned to the opposite shore like a hawk.</p>
<h3 id='chapter267'>Chapter 267 Strange Person in the Rain</h3>
<p>“Don’t come over.” Zhou Wen shouted coldly as he stopped the officers who were rushing over. He placed Xu Wen, who was moaning in pain, on the ground and said, “Do you have water? Bring me some water.”</p>
<p>The officers looked at Zhou Wen, who was covered in blood, and their eyes looked odd and complicated. They had no way of connecting him to the former prodigal student.</p>
<p>“Yes.” One of the officers answered and quickly brought a water bottle over.</p>
<p>“Just throw it over and bring some more,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>The officer quickly threw the water bottle over and the other officers quickly went to get more water too.</p>
<p>Xu Wen felt as though her entire body was being stabbed by needles. She was so uncomfortable that she couldn’t say a word. However, her mind was a lot clearer. She watched as Zhou Wen used water to wash the blood rain from her face and hair before finally washing the blood rain from her armor. Then, he lifted her up and placed her on a clean patch of grass.</p>
<p>“She will recover in a while. Take good care of her.” Zhou Wen glanced at Xu Wen before standing up and flying across the river again.</p>
<p>Xu Wen endured the pain as she pressed her hands against the ground to support her upper body. Seeing Zhou Wen’s figure disappear into the blood rain, an inexplicable expression appeared on her face.</p>
<p>The officers surrounded her and asked, “Head Nurse Xu, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Xu Wen was still in great pain, but she could feel that her condition was improving</p>
<p>She didn’t know how Zhou Wen had done it. Up to this point, they had yet to come up with a method to effectively resist the blood rain. One could withstand the blood rain only if their physique was strong enough-at the Epic stage-coupled with some protective Primordial Energy Skills.</p>
<p>Once someone was infected by the blood rain, there was no proper treatment. As the head nurse, Xu Wen knew how terrifying the blood rain was.</p>
<p>However, not only was Zhou Wen able to ignore the virus in the blood rain, but he was also able to remove the blood rain’s virus from her body. This left her feeling incredulous. There was no way to connect Zhou Wen with the prodigal student who stayed cooped up all day gaming and consuming tonics.</p>
<p>Could it be that as long as one enters the An family, those who aren’t surnamed An will become strange? Another figure appeared in Xu Wen’s mind. It was a harmless-looking man who always wore a smile. Zhou Wen was extremely similar to the man she had met back then.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen quickly proceeded through the blood rain. He had to quickly catch up with Lu Yunxian and company and track them down to find that Chi. After hearing Xu Wen’s description, Zhou Wen knew that the entity that swallowed the stone artifact was definitely a Chi.</p>
<p>They were unable to see anything in the blood rain, but Zhou Wen could use Truth Listener’s powers to grasp his surroundings. Soon, he found Commander Lu and company.</p>
<p>However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, Commander Lu and company hadn’t gone far. They were proceeding forward very slowly.</p>
<p>Although they were wearing custom raincoats, the blood rain had affected their visibility. They didn’t dare move too quickly, afraid that they might bump into dimensional creatures. Once their raincoats were torn, they would die.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know where the Chi was, so he could only follow them patiently. Thankfully, there was the blood rain. Zhou Wen didn’t need to stay too far from them, nor did he need to hide himself too much. All he needed to do was follow them since no one could discover him in the blood rain.</p>
<p>With an umbrella in hand, Zhou Wen slowly proceeded through the blood rain while observing the situation ahead. If they encountered other dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen had to ensure their safety, to ensure that they could find the Chi that had swallowed the stone artifact.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian wore a heavy expression as he proceeded through the blood rain. Even at the Epic stage, he only had a visibility range of ten meters. He was blind to anything further.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it was as if they were in a dangerous forest. The blood rain around them was like a dense bush, and it was possible for a venomous snake to jump out of it at any time.</p>
<p>Even Lu Yunxian himself was terrified, let alone those Legendary officers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lu Yunxian felt a chill run down his spine as an ominous feeling arose in his heart. He immediately shouted, “Be careful. There might be an enemy attack.”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian believed in his intuition. This was something forged over the years while on the battlefield. Although it wasn’t necessarily accurate, it had saved his life many times.</p>
<p>The group looked around, but it was useless. The blood rain affected their vision, preventing them from seeing anything.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian tried his best to look forward, but no matter how he tried, the raindrops quickly blurred the scenes. He vaguely made out a figure walking in front of him. He took a careful look, but he couldn’t confirm the figure.</p>
<p>“Who’s that in front? Say something if you are human.” Lu Yunxian shouted, but no one answered him except for the sound of rain.</p>
<p>However, as the figure approached, Lu Yun finally saw it clearly. It was a strange person with black hair hanging low. He was drenched in the blood rain and his skin was stained with blood. It was certain that even if he was human, he was probably a monster now.</p>
<p>“That’s a ghost… a ghost…” Liu Chengzhi immediately shouted as he saw the figure, his voice filled with fear.</p>
<p>“Vanguard team, attack.” Lu Yunxian summoned his Companion Beast. It was a stone golem that could withstand the power of the blood rain.</p>
<p>The other officers also summoned the few Companion Beasts that could withstand the blood rain as they charged alongside the stone golem.</p>
<p>The few Companion Beasts used their various abilities to attack the strange person that was slowly walking through the blood rain. The Epic stone golem, in particular, struck the strange person’s head with a terrifying punch.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The strange person’s head exploded before his entire body exploded, splattering into black liquid.</p>
<p>The group of officers cheered, but halfway through their cheers, their faces froze. This was because the Companion Beasts that were stained with the black liquid appeared to be snow that made contact with burning charcoal as they emitted large amounts of white gas.</p>
<p>A few Legendary Companion Beasts instantly melted into a pool of liquid. The stone golem’s body was riddled with holes from the corrosion, and its arms were cracked apart. One of its legs corroded and broke off as it fell into the pool of blood.</p>
<p>Under the horrified gazes of the group, the black liquid once again coagulated into the black-haired person, who had half his face covered by black hair. He opened his mouth and gave them a silent and eerie laugh. It left everyone’s scalp tingling as they suffered goosebumps. They wished they could immediately turn around and flee.</p>
<p>However, as soldiers, although they were terrified, they still raised their weapons and launched their most intense attack on the strange person the moment they heard Lu Yunxian’s order.</p>
<p>The sword and saber beams criss-crossed as Lu Yunxian’s punch was as violent as a volcanic eruption. It was the most domineering strike under his Life Soul Fire General’s augmentation. It could even melt solid gold.</p>
<h3 id='chapter268'>Chapter 268 The Person Under the Umbrella</h3>
<p>The strange person’s figure rapidly moved like a wandering spirit amidst the attack. He appeared and disappeared randomly like a ghost, causing all the attacks to miss.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian’s domineering explosive punch created a ravine that was more than ten meters long, evaporating large amounts of blood, but it didn’t damage the strange person at all.</p>
<p>“Ah!” One of the officers retreated in shock. The strange person had appeared in front of him and his eyes were completely black without any white. He looked at him through his hair and left him horrified. He couldn’t help but scream and retreat.</p>
<p>However, the strange person’s hand had already grabbed at his neck, his hand like a ghastly claw.</p>
<p>“How dare you!” Lu Yunxian threw out a tempestuous punch as the flames roared out like a tiger.</p>
<p>However, the strange person’s figure disappeared in the blood rain. When he appeared again, he was behind the officer. His ghastly claws were just moments from grabbing the officer’s head.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone felt a chill rise in their hearts. They knew very well that with one death, it would only be a matter of time before all of them were wiped out.</p>
<p>If one couldn’t find a way to defeat the dimensional creature, they would easily be wiped out. The only way out was to escape.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian also knew this very well. Therefore, he had already prepared to give the order to retreat, hoping that as many of them could escape as possible. He would then hold back this terrifying dimensional creature alone. He was willing to sacrifice his life.</p>
<p>Just as the strange person’s claws were about to grab the young officer’s head, a bright beam of light shone from afar and landed on the strange person.</p>
<p>Under the light, the strange person subconsciously raised his hands to block his face. Then, he looked in the direction of the bright light.</p>
<p>“All of you, move back.” When a voice sounded, the officer finally reacted and rushed out of the strange person’s range.</p>
<p>The other officers, including Lu Yunxian, subconsciously retreated a distance.</p>
<p>Hum!</p>
<p>With a resonating hum, a Bamboo Blade streaked through the sky, tearing through the blood rain and stabbing straight into the strange person’s body. Then, the strange person’s body transformed into a pool of black liquid that scattered to the ground. The Bamboo Blade was left diagonally embedded in the land that was covered by the blood rain.</p>
<p>However, unlike before, the strange person didn’t revive again. Instead, he gradually mixed with the blood rain and seeped into the mud.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and company looked in the direction of the Bamboo Blade. They didn’t know who had saved them. However, Lu Yun found the voice rather familiar. He also seemed to have seen this strange Bamboo Blade somewhere before, but he couldn’t recall where.</p>
<p>Soon, they saw a figure walking across the pool of blood. That person was holding an umbrella in his hand, but he wasn’t wearing the heavy and bulky custom raincoat they were wearing. That person was only wearing ordinary black armor as he walked through the blood. His body had made contact with the blood, but he wasn’t infected by the blood rain’s virus. Lu Yunxian couldn’t help but sigh in amazement, thinking that the person holding the umbrella in front of him must be an extremely powerful Epic expert.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian noticed that the umbrella looked familiar. After some careful thought, he realized that he also had one. However, he had left it in the jeep and not brought it along. It would be useless in a place like this.</p>
<p>The person with the umbrella walked to the Bamboo Blade that was diagonally planted into the ground. He reached out to pull it out and sheathed it.</p>
<p>As his face was obscured by the umbrella, Lu Yunxian couldn’t see his face clearly. He gave a standard military salute and said, “Thank you for saving us, my friend. I wonder if you can leave a name. I, Lu Yunxian, from the Sunset Army’s Seventh Brigade, Third Battalion, am eternally grateful. I will definitely repay you someday…”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Lu Yunxian speak, the person looked up at him. The umbrella slightly tilted up, and Lu Yunxian finally saw the person’s face clearly. Then, he was completely stunned. His mouth was wide open, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Not only Lu Yunxian, but all the officers from the three camps widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at the face that was revealed under the umbrella. They were all dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The blood rain continued to fall, but apart from that, there was a dead silence.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, there’s not much time left. Let’s hurry up and find the dimensional creature that swallowed the stone artifact.” Zhou Wen walked forward with the Bamboo Blade in hand.</p>
<p>He originally didn’t want to show his face, but Lu Yunxian and the others were clearly no match against the Wangliang. In fact, Lu Yunxian’s strength wasn’t inferior to that of the Wangliang, especially with his fire powers being effective against it. However, in this boundless blood rain, his fire-elemental powers were greatly suppressed, while the Wangliang was greatly augmented. Just its ability to travel through liquid greatly increased its speed, preventing Lu Yunxian’s attack from being able to touch it.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, Adjutant An ordered me to take good care of you, and absolutely not allow you to step into the ancient battlefield.” The way Lu Yunxian addressed Zhou Wen was the same as before, but be it his tone or attitude, they were now completely different.</p>
<p>Soldiers obeyed orders and respected experts. In the past, they viewed Zhou Wen as a prodigal scion. Therefore, no matter how honorable Zhou Wen’s identity was, they didn’t treat him with any respect.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had come to the ancient battlefield alone and killed the dimensional creature that they were helpless against. He had even saved one of their comrade’s lives. These feats immediately earned their respect.</p>
<p>“But I’m already here, right?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Chengzhi and asked, “How far is it from where you encountered that dimensional creature?”</p>
<p>“There’s still about five kilometers left,” Liu Chengzhi answered subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, if it’s possible, let your subordinates return to the other side of the blood river. You, Liu Chengzhi, and I can then travel light and proceed at full speed. We have to use the shortest time to retrieve the stone artifact,” Zhou Wen said to Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Being in a place like this was no different from suicide for these Legendary officers.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, take us along. We are not afraid of death. We can scout the path for you.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, take us along. We can help.”</p>
<p>Before Lu Yunxian could say anything, the officers immediately cried out, showing their extreme agitation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He really didn’t understand what was going through these people’s minds. It was as if it was a glorious thing to send themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>Perhaps the saying is right. The kind of leadership determines the type of followers. Judging from how Xu Wen, Lu Yunxian, and the rest act, I can imagine what kind of leader they have. Zhou Wen suddenly felt that the man he never took seriously might be more terrifying than he imagined.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea how a leader could make a soldier be willing to die. At the very least, he couldn’t, nor did he want to do it.</p>
<p>“Immediately return to the blood river and make preparations for any rescued casualties. That’s an order.” Lu Yunxian knew that he had been too idealistic previously. Legendary officers and their Companion Beasts were useless here. The Primordial Gold firearms were almost useless. Letting them stay behind would be no different from sending them to their deaths.</p>
<p>He strictly ordered the officers to return the way they had come, leaving Liu Chengzhi and Zhou Wen behind. Lu Yunxian looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Young Master Wen, I have a question for you. Please answer me truthfully.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter269'>Chapter 269 Stone Chi</h3>
<p>“What?” Zhou Wen frowned.</p>
<p>“Did you plan on entering the ancient battlefield before you came to Zhuzhuo? Or did you decide on it at the last minute?” Lu Yunxian asked.</p>
<p>“Is there a difference if I already had a plan?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. If you had already made a plan, you would naturally have made a lot of preparations. It wouldn’t be as easy to die here. If it’s just a spur of the moment, I will send you back no matter what,” said Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>“I have indeed made a lot of preparations. It shouldn’t be that easy to die. Let’s go. We don’t have time to waste. We need to find the stone artifact and take it to the ruins as soon as possible.” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Chengzhi and said, “Lead the way. Just walk forward. If I don’t say stop, continue walking.”</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi nodded. Due to Zhou Wen’s arrival, the fear in his heart lessened significantly.</p>
<p>They had previously encountered the Wangliang, and many had died. However, Zhou Wen had easily killed one. This did plenty to assuage his fear.</p>
<p>The trio continued on. Although they were fewer in number, the atmosphere was not as oppressive as before.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian watched as Zhou Wen walked ahead with the umbrella open. He found it somewhat odd, having no way of connecting this Zhou Wen to the one he had known previously.</p>
<p>“Stop.” Lu Yunxian suddenly heard Zhou Wen’s voice and hurriedly stopped to look at him. Seeing Zhou Wen staring ahead, he traced Zhou Wen’s gaze and saw nothing but the blood rain.</p>
<p>“Liu Chengzhi, retreat now.” Zhou Wen walked in front of Liu Chengzhi and pulled out his Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>When the rain hit the blade, not a drop remained on it as they streaked straight down. Even in the rain, the Bamboo Blade remained untainted as it shimmered with a cold glint.</p>
<p>After a while, Lu Yunxian saw another strange person walk through the rain and approach them. It looked identical to the strange person they had met earlier. He couldn’t help but be put on alert as he gathered his strength to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately moved as his eyes shot out a light beam that shone down on the strange person’s body. In the next second, Zhou Wen’s figure had vanished. When he appeared again, the Bamboo Blade pierced through the strange person’s body, causing it to explode into a mass of black liquid. A dimensional crystal dropped as a result.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian glanced at Zhou Wen as he found it increasingly bizarre. He wondered if Zhou Wen really was a student at the Legendary stage. In this terrifying place where even an Epic stage expert was treading on thin ice, he seemed to be in control of everything. He could easily kill a dimensional creature, that even he was helpless against, with a swing of his saber.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue,” Zhou Wen said to Liu Chengzhi as he picked up the dimensional crystal.</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Master Wen.” Liu Chengzhi was a lot more spirited. After responding, he took large strides forward, the fear in his heart seemingly lessened.</p>
<p>During the rest of the journey, Zhou Wen and company didn’t encounter any dimensional creatures. There weren’t many dimensional creatures on the ancient battlefield to begin with, but every one of them was terrifying and had their own unique traits.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s deep understanding of them that he gleaned from the game as well as knowing the method to counter these dimensional creatures, the three of them would have long died.</p>
<p>After walking for more than five kilometers, they still didn’t see any signs of the Chi which Liu Chengzhi had mentioned. It was unknown if Liu Chengzhi had led them in the wrong direction or if that Chi had already gone somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Old Liu, how much farther do we have to go?” Lu Yunxian also felt that they had gone too far and asked.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi scratched his head and said, “We should have already reached the area where we encountered it, but for some reason, we didn’t see any traces of it.”</p>
<p>When Liu Chengzhi said that, Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian felt that something was amiss. If that Chi had really left this area, where could they find it when the ancient battlefield was so huge?</p>
<p>Besides, there wasn’t only one Chi on the battlefield. How would they know which one was the one that swallowed the stone artifact?</p>
<p>“Don’t walk any further. Let’s try to search the vicinity.” The ChiMeiWangliang that Zhou Wen encountered in the game all loitered in a fixed area. They didn’t wander off too far.</p>
<p>However, this was reality and not a game. No one knew if the Chi would remain here.</p>
<p>The three of them adjusted their direction slightly and searched the surrounding ruins. After searching in trepidation for a while, Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to find a Chi.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the Chi, Zhou Wen frowned and said to Liu Chengzhi, “Confirm if it’s that monster who swallowed the stone artifact you brought back.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had seen many Chi in-game. They were mostly identical in appearance, so there was no difference.</p>
<p>However, this Chi was clearly different from the ones Zhou Wen had seen. Typically, they were all in black-scaled armor. Although they looked strange, they looked like living beings.</p>
<p>The Chi in front of him was different. Its body was grayish-white and it looked like a stone sculpture. If it hadn’t slowly walked over, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t have believed it to be a living thing.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi couldn’t see it at first. Only when the Chi came closer did he finally see it clearly. His face was filled with puzzlement. “From the looks of it, it doesn’t seem wrong, but the one we saw looked like a living thing. Why does this one look like a stone statue?”</p>
<p>The moment Liu Chengzhi said that, the Chi roared as a gray flame rose from its body. Then, Zhou Wen and company felt the ground quake violently.</p>
<p>“No good. Quick, dodge.” Zhou Wen flew up and, at the instant his feet left the ground, stone spears pierced out from the ground.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Liu Chengzhi jumped up as well, dodging the sharp stone spears.</p>
<p>They did not have the ability to withstand the blood rain. If they were stabbed by the spears, even if they survived it, they would probably still be dead if their custom raincoats were damaged.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled. This Chi was somewhat different from what he had seen in the game. It even had different skills.</p>
<p>The Chi roared as it charged forward. As he didn’t know anything about it, Zhou Wen didn’t dare to forcefully fight it. He summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, hoping to test the strange Chi’s powers.</p>
<p>Although the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was only at the Legendary stage, it had the Life Providence of Golden Body and the Invulnerable Golden Power skill. Previously, it had been able to withstand two to three blows from a Chi in-game without dying.</p>
<p>Seeing the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior standing in its way, the Chi rolled its eyes and shot out two blurry gray beams of light that shot straight at it.</p>
<p>Seeing another skill he had never seen before, Zhou Wen immediately felt ominous. However, it was already too late for him to dismiss the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior. When the light landed, its body cracked like tempered glass. In the next second, it was reduced to fragments that fell all over the ground. It had been killed.</p>
<h3 id='chapter270'>Chapter 270 The Strange Chi</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen felt his heart wince in pain. Although the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior was only a Legendary pet, it was extremely rare. Furthermore, it was a tank. Zhou Wen had always used it to scout in-game, so with him dead, it was impossible for him to revive like in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s tattoo that represented the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior also vanished. It made Zhou Wen realize that this wasn’t a game, and he only had one life. If he died, that was it.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian let out a roar and struck out with an explosive flaming fist. The terrifying flames charged towards the Stone Chi like a ferocious tiger.</p>
<p>A light beam shot out from the Stone Chi’s eyes once again and collided with the flaming tiger. A violent explosion occurred in the air and the flaming tiger and light beam dissipated together.</p>
<p>Flames burst out from Lu Yunxian’s body, as though a flaming general had possessed him. He continuously released flames with his fists, each punch like a ferocious tiger pounce as they rushed towards the Stone Chi.</p>
<p>Although the light beam the Stone Chi shot out was powerful, the speed at which it shot was relatively slow. The time gap between shots was a little long, so it was unable to withstand the numerous flaming tiger punches.</p>
<p>Seeing that more than ten flaming tigers were about to hit it, it roared and the gray gas over its body condensed into a grayish-white stone dragon.</p>
<p>The stone dragon opened its mouth and took a deep breath before swallowing the flaming tigers. It didn’t even make a sound, as though its stomach was a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Although the power of the stone dragon Life Soul was terrifying, Zhou Wen had already seen it in-game. He wasn’t surprised, but instead glad to see something he knew.</p>
<p>At the very least, this strange Stone Chi still retained some of its powers and characteristics. It was not completely different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have any intention of helping Lu Yunxian in the battle against the Stone Chi. Instead, all he did was watch from the side.</p>
<p>After all, he was only at the Legendary stage. Before he figured out the Stone Chi’s strengths and weaknesses, even if he went up to help, it would not be of much use. It might even affect Lu Yunxian’s performance.</p>
<p>Sometimes, appropriate observation could be more efficient than direct combat. Zhou Wen waited patiently by the side for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian was indeed the commander of a battalion. His flaming powers were extremely tempestuous. Other than being a little slow, the other aspects were considered quite impressive amongst those at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the augmentation of the Flaming General Life Soul, Lu Yunxian kept striking out with the Flaming Tiger Fist without any signs of Primordial Energy depletion.</p>
<p>The man and Chi fought an intense battle, but the Stone Chi clearly held the upper hand. The stone dragon Life Soul on its body could devour all of Lu Yunxian’s flaming tiger punches with a single inhale. It looked like it was completely effortless.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the stone dragon wasn’t able to redirect the attacks like the Purple Air Bells. It just swallowed the attack; otherwise, it would have been even more terrifying.</p>
<p>The Stone Chi was unable to break through Lu Yunxian’s Flaming Tiger Fist and became a little irritable. It actually tried to charge at Lu Yunxian, slamming straight into the Flaming Tiger Fist. It ended up retreating from the blow, but its body didn’t suffer any damage. With a roar, it rushed over again.</p>
<p>The stone dragon swallowed and the light in the Stone Chi’s eyes shone out gray rays. It forcefully broke through the airtightness of the Flaming Tiger Fist and slammed into Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian hurriedly summoned a few Companion Beasts because his best stone golem had already died in the previous battle. Although the few that he could use weren’t bad, they weren’t as good as the stone golem.</p>
<p>The Stone Chi wreaked havoc as its gigantic claws ripped at him while sweeping its eye rays across. In moments, all the Companion Beasts that Lu Yunxian summoned were killed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed when he saw this. The Stone Chi hadn’t used the black smoke skill of ordinary Chi. This left Zhou Wen somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>When in-game, Zhou Wen used the Purple Air Bells to absorb the black smoke from the Chi before letting it have a taste of its own medicine.</p>
<p>The black smoke possessed powerful hypnotic powers that even the Chi couldn’t withstand. Therefore, Zhou Wen was able to easily kill the Chi.</p>
<p>However, this Stone Chi hadn’t released any black smoke skills the entire time. Zhou Wen had no way of absorbing it even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Now, all I can do is absorb the Stone Chi’s gray ray. Seeing that Lu Yunxian was no longer able to put up a fight, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait any longer. He summoned the Purple Air Bell and, with a flash, arrived beside Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>The Stone Chi’s ray was directed at Lu Yunxian, so when Zhou Wen appeared in front of him, he raised the Purple Air Bell to meet the incoming gray ray.</p>
<p>Immediately, he saw a blurry light shoot into the interior of the bell as though it had been slurped up like noodles.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Wen held the bell and shook it at the Stone Chi. A thick gray pillar of light spewed out from the bell’s mouth as it shot towards the Stone Chi.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The ray shot out from the Stone Chi’s eyes clashed with the pillar of light from the bell. However, it was shattered. Just as the light pillar was about to land on its body</p>
<p>The stone dragon Life Soul let out a roar as it opened its mouth and inhaled. It swallowed the pillar of light, averting any harm to the Stone Chi.</p>
<p>Indeed, it doesn’t work. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>Previously, when he used black smoke to deal with the Chi, if the black dragon Life Soul were to suck the black smoke, it too would fall into a slumber. Now, there were none of the benefits.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian took the opportunity to attack the Stone Chi, but his attacks failed to be effective.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied on his Purple Air Bell’s powers to absorb the Stone Chi’s rays as he joined forces with Lu Yunxian. All he could do was hold back the Stone Chi, but killing it was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Before long, Lu Yunxian’s punches began to weaken. Although he was augmented by Flaming General, his Primordial Energy consumption was just too high. He could not hold on much longer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen allowed Doctor Darkness to possess him as he used Light of Penetration to illuminate the Stone Chi, but the result left Zhou Wen alarmed. Under Light of Penetration, the Stone Chi’s body was covered in a gray blur that prevented him from seeing through anything.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Why can’t I see through it? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled.</p>
<p>Previously, when he was fighting Wangliangs and Chis, he could use the Light of Penetration to observe their bodies’ interior. But now, it was completely ineffective. It could only mean that this Stone Chi was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Could it be that this Stone Chi is the Chi that devoured the stone artifact? The stone artifact affected it, making it undergo such a strange mutation? Zhou Wen secretly guessed.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Stone Chi’s patience seemed to be completely worn out by the duo. It roared as the stone dragon emitted a dragon roar before spewing out a mouthful of gray smoke.</p>
<p>The gray smoke looked like the normal black dragon’s black smoke, but the color was a little different.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury of time to think. He raised the Purple Air Bell and sucked in the gray smoke as he saw it surge into the Purple Air Bell’s interior.</p>
<h3 id='chapter271'>Chapter 271 Stone Artifact</h3>
<p>When the gray smoke was sucked into the Purple Air Bell, Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>The metallic purple bell began to turn grayish-white as though its surface was covered in a layer of ash. Furthermore, it was rapidly petrifying and seemed moments from becoming a rock.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. He hurriedly shook the Purple Air Bell and spat out the gray smoke inside.</p>
<p>The gray smoke swept towards the Stone Chi, only to be sucked in by the stone dragon.</p>
<p>Unlike before, the gray smoke was ineffective against the stone dragon Life Soul. The stone dragon remained brimming with energy, but the Purple Air Bell in Zhou Wen’s hand was still gray. It didn’t recover from its original appearance after releasing the gray smoke.</p>
<p>There’s definitely something wrong with this Stone Chi. If it really turned into this because it swallowed the stone artifact, what is that stone object? How can it have such terrifying power? What did Ouyang Lan and company encounter in that stone cave? Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.</p>
<p>The Stone Chi let out a ferocious roar as it charged after Zhou Wen. Rays shot out from its eyes and thankfully, Zhou Wen’s movement technique was as fast as lightning, allowing him to duck the Stone Chi’s attack.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian hurriedly struck out his Flaming Tiger Fist to remedy the situation, but it was devoured by the stone dragon Life Soul. This resulted in the Stone Chi changing its target as it pounced towards Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian was wearing the raincoat, so he couldn’t use his body to block the attacks of the Stone Chi. If he did, his raincoat would definitely tear and that would spell certain doom for him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lu Yunxian had nowhere to retreat to, Zhou Wen hurriedly used Ghost Steps to appear behind the Stone Chi as he slashed at its neck with Bamboo Blade.</p>
<p>The stone dragon Life Soul that was wrapped around the Stone Chi’s body roared and spat out the gray smoke at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only retreat. The Purple Air Bell couldn’t withstand the gray smoke, much less him. He naturally didn’t dare to clash head-on with it.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian rolled on the ground in a sorry state before dodging the ray shot from the Stone Chi’s eyes. Instantly, the Stone Chi broke out into a frenzy, forcing Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian to flee.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi had not fully recovered from his injuries, and his Companion Beast had already been sacrificed. He didn’t have any combat strength, so all he could do was use his machine gun to shoot at the Stone Chi.</p>
<p>However, when the bullets mixed with Primordial Gold hit the Stone Chi, there was no effect at all. They bounced off it like billiard balls.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lu Yunxian could not hold on any longer and the Stone Chi was about to catch up with him, Zhou Wen summoned Ghost Bride and sent her over to release Yin Wind Claw at the Stone Chi’s back.</p>
<p>However, the effects of the Yin Wind Claw were very limited. Basically, they amounted to a mere scratch of an itch.</p>
<p>The Chi turned its head and shot a glance at Ghost Bride. A gray ray through Ghost Bride’s body, but it failed to cause any damage. However, Zhou Wen noticed Ghost Bride’s body trembling clearly. It was as though she had been struck by lightning and her aura had clearly weakened.</p>
<p>This Stone Chi is ridiculous! Zhou Wen was appalled when he saw that the Stone Chi could actually injure a ghost’s body.</p>
<p>Knowing that this battle only had two outcomes- life or death, Zhou Wen could no longer hesitate. He held the Bamboo Blade as a mysterious and powerful aura surged out of him. Sigh of the King descended upon him, and the immense power made his body float in midair. He could levitate without needing any external help.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian dodged the Stone Chi’s attack in a sorry state when he saw a bolt of lightning flash from the sky and shoot straight for the Stone Chi’s body. Then, he saw streaks of lightning interweave against each other as they shuttled back and forth through the Stone Chi’s body. It was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>As it was too fast, even the Stone Chi failed to react. By the time it reacted, by having the stone dragon Life Soul spew out the gray smoke, Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal had already ended.</p>
<p>After Transcendent Flying Immortal was done, Zhou Wen immediately widened his distance with Ghost Steps to dodge the rolling gray smoke. As his feet touched the ground, he quickly suppressed the Sigh of the King’s power once again.</p>
<p>Just that split moment of usage was enough to make Zhou Wen feel as though all his muscles had been ripped apart in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Stone Chi’s body shattered piece by piece, turning into a pile of rocks that scattered on the ground. Its body had actually been diced into a pile of rocks with Transcendent Flying Immortal.</p>
<p>Before Zhou Wen and company could rejoice, the rocks began moving again as though an invisible hand was building up toy blocks. They then pieced the rocks back together, restoring the lively and energetic Stone Chi.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Liu Chengzhi instantly felt despair. The Stone Chi was incomprehensibly strong. There was almost no loophole to speak of.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes flashed like lightning as they shimmered with a calm luster.</p>
<p>When the Stone Chi was cleaved apart by Transcendent Flying Immortal, Truth Listener’s powers allowed him to piece together a projection of whatever he heard in his mind. At that time, Zhou Wen realized that there was a strange triangular stone in the Stone Chi when it was being diced up.</p>
<p>The stone was different from the rocks that made up the Stone Chi. Although it was triangular in shape, there was a curve at the edge. In the middle, there was a circular hole that looked ancient and mysterious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the Stone Chi was resurrected, it seemed like it had once again gathered the rubble with it at the center.</p>
<p>“Liu Chengzhi, is the stone artifact you brought back a triangular piece of rock with a circular hole in the middle?” Zhou Wen shouted as he dodged the Stone Chi’s attacks.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Liu Chengzhi was stunned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was now certain that the Stone Chi had mutated into this strange abomination thanks to the stone artifact.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he used Sigh of the King once more, risking the damage to his body. As the terrifying power descended upon him, Zhou Wen felt his bones groan in pain as though they would suddenly break at any moment. His already tearing muscles even began to crack into bloody patterns.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen endured the pain and once again used Ghost Steps, appearing beside the Stone Chi like a ghost.</p>
<p>However, this time, the Stone Chi was prepared… The moment Zhou Wen appeared, the stone dragon Life Soul spewed out a mouthful of gray smoke at him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Purple Air Bell that seemed to be covered in dust as he sucked the gray smoke into it. However, this completely petrified the bell. Before Zhou Wen could shake it, cracks began to appear on its body as it shattered and was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Transcendent Flying Immortal! Releasing the bell, Zhou Wen drew his saber and used Transcendent Flying Immortal, transforming into a blur that criss-crossed around the Stone Chi as he constantly struck it.</p>
<p>With the sharpness of Bamboo Blade, the terrifying power of the Sigh of the King, and the dominance of Transcendent Flying Immortal, he once again split apart the Stone Chi’s body.</p>
<p>At the instant the Stone Chi’s body shattered, a cold glint flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes as he threw out the Bamboo Blade in his hand. It manifested into a cold beam as it tore through the rubble and struck away a stone piece.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s figure flashed with the use of Ghost Steps, arriving in front of the Bamboo Blade instantaneously. As he grabbed the Bamboo Blade, he pressed down on the stone piece.</p>
<h3 id='chapter272'>Chapter 272 Killing the Stone Chi</h3>
<p>“Pfft!” When Zhou Wen pressed down on the stone, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood. He had used the Sigh of the King for too long and his internal organs had been torn apart. He was already suffering from severe internal bleeding.</p>
<p>If it were any ordinary person, they would have been dead, but Zhou Wen held on. He looked at the shattered stone that manifested the Stone Chi. If the Stone Chi wasn’t dead, the three of them would be doomed. Zhou Wen was powerless to continue fighting.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Liu Chengzhi stared intently at the pile of rubble. The entire world seemed to quieten down at that moment as the three of them could almost hear their rapidly-beating hearts.</p>
<p>After the silence continued for a while, Liu Chengzhi was a little unsure, but he said hopefully, “It’s not… It’s not moving… It really seems to be dead…”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen exhaled as he felt the pain in his body. It made him feel like his skin was being ripped off, but he still held onto the stone with one hand.</p>
<p>When he first pressed down on the piece of stone, Zhou Wen could still sense it throbbing and struggling a few times. However, it quickly calmed down, as though it was a lifeless object.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, your raincoat…” Zhou Wen had just heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Liu Chengzhi exclaim.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Liu Chengzhi and saw his horrified expression. He had his finger pointed at Lu Yunxian as his fingers trembled nonstop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked in the direction of his finger and saw that Lu Yunxian’s custom raincoat had torn at his waist. Although the opening wasn’t large, the blood rain was already dripping in.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian didn’t know when the raincoat had been torn apart during the intense battle. The color in his face drained as his pupils gradually turned red.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’m afraid I can’t accompany you any further. I have let down Adjutant An and failed to complete the mission he assigned me. I even brought you into the ancient battlefield. However, I beg you to take the stone artifact to the ruins and hand it over to Adjutant An. I’m sure you can do it.” As Lu Yunxian spoke, his eyes became increasingly bloodshot. His breath also became heavier.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’ll make a move now. I hope I can still be a member of the Sunset army in my next life.” Chaos began to rule Lu Yunxian’s consciousness as bloodthirst overwhelmed his intelligence. He knew that he didn’t have much time left. Unwilling to become a rabid monster, he raised his fist that had gathered flames and was about to smash himself in the head.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Zhou Wen endured his pain as he ordered Doctor Darkness to leave his body and charge at Lu Yunxian. At the same time, he activated his surgical skills.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian did not listen to Zhou Wen. He did not wish to die like a rabid dog.</p>
<p>However, his fist did not land on his head. Dr. Soul’s scalpel was faster as it stabbed into his neck, causing his body to stiffen and become motionless.</p>
<p>At the same time, Doctor Darkness came in front of Lu Yunxian. A syringe appeared in his hand as he stabbed into his blood vessel, injecting the poison into his body.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian felt the excruciating pain in his body. He could not help but let out a cry, but the blood color in his eyes gradually faded away as he slowly returned to normal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen propped himself up. With the stone artifact in one hand, he picked up the umbrella that he had thrown into the rain with the other. After shaking away the blood rain on it, he opened it. He then stood in front of Lu Yunxian and sheltered him with the umbrella.</p>
<p>“Do you still have any armor-type Companion Beasts? Can they first block the damage from the rain?” Zhou Wen asked Lu Yunxian as he unsummoned Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian’s consciousness had mostly recovered. He could feel that the virus that had invaded his body was being expelled by the pain.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any armor left, but I still have a Companion Beast that should be able to remedy the situation.” Lu Yunxian looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Back when An Sheng ordered him to protect Zhou Wen, he had never imagined such a day would come. He never expected so many things to happen between him and Zhou Wen, making him feel as if he was in a dream.</p>
<p>“Then quickly fix it. My body is very weak, so I’m afraid there’s no way for me to fight again. If we encounter a dimensional creature again, I’ll be relying on you,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian gritted his teeth and nodded at Zhou Wen. Then, he summoned a Companion Beast. It was a snake that transformed into a strange leather belt. He wrapped it around his waist, perfectly blocking the hole on his raincoat.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen staggered before he collapsed into the muddy ground that was covered in blood. The damage to his body was too serious. Despite switching to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it was still difficult to completely recover in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra’s restoration is still lacking. If only I could have Li Xuan’s Immortal God of Combat body, that would allow me to quickly recover from this injury. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, are you alright?” Liu Chengzhi hurriedly came forward to help Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Let him rest for a while.” Lu Yunxian spoke, but his pupils suddenly constricted as his eyes widened.</p>
<p>Liu Chengzhi struck Zhou Wen’s head with his palm, and the purple light from his palm flashed with a ghastly glow. His aura was not inferior to Lu Yunxian’s, and it was even more demonic and powerful.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian couldn’t figure out how Liu Chengzhi, who had yet to recover from his injuries, could produce such terrifying strength. Even in perfectly good condition, he wouldn’t have such strength, let alone when he was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lu Yunxian knew that Liu Chengzhi likely cultivated a wind-elemental Primordial Energy Art, but his palm was clearly not wind-elemental.</p>
<p>There was no time for Lu Yunxian to think further. Liu Chengzhi was too close to Zhou Wen, so there was no way for him to dodge the strike. Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s body was too weak.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Lu Yunxian extended his hand, hoping to use his arm to block Zhou Wen’s strike.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen was faster than Lu Yunxian. He raised the stone artifact in his hand and parried Lu Yunxian’s arm, causing Liu Chengzhi’s palm to land on the stone artifact.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>A blurry light emitted from the stone artifact. The purple light on Liu Chengzhi’s palm shattered as he retreated a few steps due to the recoil. Standing amid the rain of blood, he stared at Zhou Wen with an odd expression.</p>
<p>The raincoat covering his palm had torn, and his unshielded palm was exposed to the blood rain. However, the blood rain had failed to penetrate his body.</p>
<p>“You are not Liu Chengzhi, who exactly are you?” Lu Yunxian stared at Liu Chengzhi and asked.</p>
<p>Although Liu Chengzhi was also an Epic, he was only considered average among them. Even Lu Yunxian couldn’t fend off the blood rain with his bare body, much less Liu Chengzhi.</p>
<p>“Hehe… I’m Liu Chengzhi…” Liu Chengzhi’s expression and voice became strange. It was clearly a man’s body, but his demeanor and voice were that of a woman’s.</p>
<h3 id='chapter273'>Chapter 273 Paper Slip</h3>
<p>“You are the Mei, the succubus.” Sitting in the rain of blood, Zhou Wen suddenly stared at Liu Chengzhi after some thought.</p>
<p>There were three types of monsters among the ChiMeiWangliang, but despite seeing the Wangliang and Chi, Zhou Wen hadn’t seen the Mei. Now, Liu Chengzhi didn’t look like a normal human in any way.</p>
<p>“Hehe… You’re really smart… You actually saw through my identity. What a pity that I failed to kill you despite having such a good opportunity.” As Liu Chengzhi spoke, his body trembled strangely. A strange purple smoke drifted out of his seven orifices.</p>
<p>The purple smoke gradually gathered together, transforming into a blurry purple figure. However, the figure was enveloped by the purple smoke. Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian could only see a woman’s figure, but they couldn’t see what she looked like.</p>
<p>After the purple smoke completely wafted out, Liu Chengzhi’s body collapsed. He no longer had an aura that a living person should have. He was obviously a dead person, and his body was rapidly rotting.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see through your identity previously, but I found it a little strange. Why was it only you who managed to escape? From my point of view, you weren’t equipped with the possibility of escaping. Besides, I’m born with a cold personality, so it’s hard for me to trust anyone. I’m wary of anyone,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“I see. I imagined that you had long seen through me considering how you could call out my name,” the purple figure said with a giggle.</p>
<p>“Why did you possess Liu Chengzhi’s body and trick us here?” Zhou Wen only wanted to stall for time so that his body could recover a little more.</p>
<p>The Mei in front of him might be more difficult to deal with than Stone Chi. Although the Stone Chi was strong, its intelligence wasn’t high. In contrast, the purple figure was full of tricks.</p>
<p>“That Chi was lucky to have swallowed the stone artifact that Liu Chengzhi and the others had brought out. By the time I discovered it and rushed here, it had already begun to evolve and I was no longer its match. Therefore, I could only think of a way to lure you humans here and hope that both of you would suffer a deadly outcome. However, I didn’t expect that you humans only had such a pittance of strength left. I was originally a little disappointed, believing that my chances were null. I never expected a human like you to appear. It was quite a pleasant surprise.”</p>
<p>As the Mei spoke, she gave a coquettish laugh and said to Zhou Wen charmingly, “I still have to thank you for helping me kill the Stone Chi and retrieve the stone artifact. The power in your body sure is potent. It even makes me feel fear. It’s truly amazing. Unfortunately, your body is too weak. It’s impossible for you to withstand such a potent force. If you still wish to use it, your body will explode from that force even without me raising a finger. Your body is on the edge of breaking down. You can no longer fight me. If you were to offer the stone artifact to me with both hands, I will spare your lives and allow the two of you to leave Zhuolu alive.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, leave now. I’ll stop her,” Lu Yunxian stood in front of Zhou Wen and said with a burning gaze.</p>
<p>The Mei curled her lips disdainfully. “The potency of your flames have been reduced to less than 70% of its original might in the Lord of the Rain’s Baneful Blood Rain. Furthermore, you’ve just been injured and you don’t even have half your full combat strength. I only need a moment to kill you. Where can a person whose body is about to collapse run?”</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve planned everything,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at her. Although he believed that one could change their destiny, he had to admit that ever since he obtained the Bamboo Blade, his luck had really changed drastically. He had been in danger several times.</p>
<p>“I was luckier than my plan called for. Since you aren’t willing to hand over the stone artifact, I have no choice but to pull it out from your fingers when you are dead.” The Mei saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts as a purple light suffused her body and she walked towards him.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian gathered his strength and punched out with Flaming Tiger Fist. However, the Mei extended her hand and pressed the top of the flaming tiger’s head with her slender palm. The flaming tiger instantly extinguished as though it was a pricked bubble.</p>
<p>“As I said, your combat strength is less than 50%. Killing you will be too easy,” said the Mei as she walked.</p>
<p>“It won’t be difficult for you to obtain this stone artifact, but can you tell me what it is before I give it to you?” Zhou Wen asked as he held the stone artifact.</p>
<p>“There’s no harm in telling you. In the Zhuolu battle years ago, there was a clash between two dimensional life-forms. The stone artifact was the holy object of one side,” said the Mei.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the Zhuolu battle between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou? They are all humans. How did they involve dimensional life-forms?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“They are human, but what they represent aren’t just humans. Otherwise, how could two mere humans invite so many terrifying dimensional creatures to participate in the battle?” said the Mei indifferently. “The two of them are merely representatives of different dimensional life-form factions in the mortal world. The dimensional life-form represented by the Yellow Emperor is a race that treats stones as holy. And the dimensional creature represented by Chiyou treats metal as holy. The stone artifact you have is one of the holy artifacts that Yellow Emperor obtained from the stone-elemental dimensional life-forms.</p>
<p>“According to what I know from legends, ChiMeiWangliang were creatures that stood on Chiyou’s side. If the legend is right, what use does the Yellow Emperor’s stone artifact have on you?” Zhou Wen tried to stall for time, but his injuries were too serious. It was impossible for him to recover so quickly.</p>
<p>As he spoke to the Mei, his mind raced in search of a chance for survival.</p>
<p>However, no matter how he racked his brains, the situation was just as the Mei had said. He was already in a hopeless situation and there was no possibility of him defeating her.</p>
<p>He no longer had the ability to fight, and Lu Yunxian was no match for her. The only useful combat strength he had left was Doctor Darkness. However, his combat abilities were not strong to begin with. He was more geared towards functionality than combat.</p>
<p>The Mei had also witnessed the abilities of Doctor Darkness. If she lacked confidence dealing with Doctor Darkness, she wouldn’t have taken action.</p>
<p>“It’s useless to stall for time. However, there’s no harm in telling you. That stone artifact is extremely beneficial to any dimensional life-form.” As the Mei spoke, she walked over and grabbed Zhou Wen’s head with her hand that had a purple halo.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian immediately took action while Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness. He wanted to use the scalpel to fix the Mei in place.</p>
<p>However, when Dr. Soul’s scalpel stabbed into her body, it pierced straight through. It did not work on her. Instead, Lu Yunxian was sent flying by the Mei’s purple halo as he fell into a pool of blood. The situation looked extremely bad.</p>
<p>Teacher! I can only rely on you to save me now. Zhou Wen was already at the end of his rope. Apart from using the Sigh of the King to risk his life again, he couldn’t think of any other solution. He couldn’t help but think of the tiny box Wang Mingyuan had given him before he left.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen remembered that there was a paper slip written by Wang Mingyuan in it. He didn’t know what was written on it, but hoping to make a Hail Mary effort, Zhou Wen hurriedly pulled out the box from the chaos space and opened it. He took out the slip and saw the words written on it.</p>
<p>“Kneel and beg for mercy!” Zhou Wen nearly spewed a mouthful of blood when he read the words.</p>
<h3 id='chapter274'>Chapter 274 Kneel and Beg for Mercy</h3>
<p>Teacher, this joke isn’t funny at all. You are killing me. Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry nor did he feel angry. He never expected Wang Mingyuan to pull his leg, so he was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>If kneeling to beg for mercy was useful, humans wouldn’t die in dimensional zones. After all, there were more people who cherished their lives than people who cherished their pride.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen felt as though he had reached the end of his rope. Although he had the stone artifact in hand, it didn’t have the ability to initiate an attack. Even if he were to feed it to a Companion Beast, it wouldn’t be effective. If there was an effect, it would require an evolutionary process that wasn’t instantaneous.</p>
<p>In his current situation, he was probably minutes away from being killed by the Mei. He didn’t have the luxury of time.</p>
<p>Why don’t… I kneel down and beg for mercy… Teacher wouldn’t be pulling my leg, right? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but have this thought come in his mind. Wang Mingyuan didn’t seem to have any reason to prank his student. Perhaps, it might really work.</p>
<p>However, the Mei didn’t give Zhou Wen time to finish his thoughts. She had already attacked with the strange purple halo. Zhou Wen hurriedly blocked with the stone artifact.</p>
<p>The stone artifact was tiny, while the strange purple halo seemed to blot out the sky. It was impossible for it to be effective at blocking.</p>
<p>When the purple halo dawned on him, he saw a blinding blur in front of him. He could even see the Mei within the purple halo reaching out to grab his head. The palm was inches away.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen thought he was doomed, he suddenly saw the purple halo in front of him converge. And the Mei in front of him seemed to come under the influence of a powerful magnet on the ground. Her body sank down as she knelt on the ground with a thud, sending blood splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared blankly at the Mei kneeling in front of him, at a loss.</p>
<p>The Mei knelt on the ground with both hands pressing down on the ground. Her knees and hands sank into the mud as her body trembled. She seemed to be using all her strength to prop herself up, but she just couldn’t.</p>
<p>Her head seemed to be attracted by an invisible magnetic force as she slowly sank into the ground. No matter how hard she struggled, she could not lift her head up.</p>
<p>The Mei let out a terrifying scream as purple gases rose from her body. She struggled to get up, but she was unable to move. The invisible force was so strong that she could only bow her head.</p>
<p>Did the stone artifact show its powers? This was the first thought in Zhou Wen’s mind, but he immediately rejected the idea.</p>
<p>The stone artifact was still the same as before. It did not produce any energy fluctuations at all. Unless an attack was directed onto it, it wouldn’t have any reaction. The Mei’s attack had yet to touch it, so how could it have unleashed such a powerful force?</p>
<p>If it could really produce such powerful strength to protect others, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to kill the Stone Chi so easily.</p>
<p>But if it’s not the stone artifact… that leaves only… No way… Zhou Wen turned his gaze to the paper slip in his hand.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary piece of white paper with the words “kneel and beg for mercy” written on it. As Wang Mingyuan liked calligraphy, the words were written with a brush. They were elegant with quite a flair. Each stroke contained a charm, making it a rare piece of excellent calligraphy that was in no way inferior to famous calligraphers. Even Zhou Wen, who didn’t know much, could tell that the calligraphy was beautiful.</p>
<p>However, no matter how beautiful the words were, they were just words written on ordinary paper with normal ink.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the piece of paper in his hand and immediately discovered something strange. Although it was ordinary and without any luster to it, none of the blood that rained down stained the piece of white paper at all. It was as though the raindrops automatically avoided it.</p>
<p>It can’t be… Teacher… He wasn’t pulling my leg? Zhou Wen instantly felt like he had gone from hell back to heaven. He turned the piece of paper in his hand to read the words on it, hoping to see if they emitted supreme radiance to suppress the Mei in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen turned the paper around and realized that the words on the paper were still the same. There was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>However, when he pointed the four words at him, the Mei immediately lost her restraints. She leaped up from the ground, giving Zhou Wen a fright.</p>
<p>The Mei didn’t expect the invisible force on her body to suddenly vanish. Her struggles immediately bore fruit as she flew into the air.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly aimed the words ‘kneel and beg for mercy’ at the Mei in the sky. Immediately, he saw the airborne Mei attracted to the ground by a powerful magnetic field. With a loud thud, she fell to the ground and landed on her knees with her hands pressed to the ground. She sprawled across the mud that was covered in blood and took on the kneeling posture.</p>
<p>Teacher, I love you! Zhou Wen wished he could hug the paper slip and kiss it a few times. He never expected Wang Mingyuan’s words to have such an effect.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen shouted at Lu Yunxian, “Commander Lu, what are you waiting for? Quickly kill her!”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian was also stunned by what had just happened. He widened his eyes as he looked at the Mei kneeling in the pool of blood. With Zhou Wen’s shout, he immediately snapped out of his daze and gathered all of his strength. The Flaming General Life Soul erupted as he struck out with his Flaming Tiger Fist, slamming it at the kneeling and powerless Mei.</p>
<p>The Mei was unable to defend herself and, just as the Flaming Tiger Fist was about to strike her, a trace of panic flashed in her eye. She slammed her head into the blood and shouted, “Spare me, great lord!”</p>
<p>In the next second, the invisible force field that was suppressing the Mei seemed to disappear. The Mei’s figure charged into the sky and avoided Lu Yunxian’s Flaming Tiger Fist.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! When Zhou Wen saw this, he couldn’t help but curse. He wondered about his teacher’s reliability. He could dish out a suppression, but the enemy would be fine once they begged for mercy? What was the point?</p>
<p>With the Mei liberated, wouldn’t he be in a hopeless situation again? Zhou Wen felt like he was about to go crazy from Wang Mingyuan’s antics.</p>
<p>“Hehe, how dare you receive my kowtow? You are dead.” The Mei laughed weirdly in midair, her voice filled with bone-chilling hatred.</p>
<p>Having reigned supreme in the dimensions for so many years, she had kowtowed before, but that was to supreme rulers. How could she bow to a weak human like Zhou Wen? From her point of view, it was the worst insult she had ever experienced.</p>
<p>With a terrifying purple halo, the Mei streaked across the void like a demonic purple beam, lunging straight at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, when the purple halo arrived in front of Zhou Wen, there was another loud thud. The Mei’s figure emerged from the purple beam as she found herself kneeling in the blood.</p>
<p>“I…” Zhou Wen had no idea how to describe his feelings.</p>
<h3 id='chapter275'>Chapter 275 Another Companion Egg</h3>
<p>Lu Yunxian made a prompt decision and immediately attacked the kneeling Mei.</p>
<p>The Mei’s eyes were filled with indignation and humiliation, but she had no choice but to kowtow once more and shout, “Spare me, great lord!”</p>
<p>With a shout, the Mei lost her restraints and flew into a retreat once again, turning into a purple mist; thus, avoiding Lu Yunxian’s Flaming Tiger Fist.</p>
<p>This time, the Mei didn’t charge over as anger, resentment, indignation, and other emotions mixed together. She glared fiercely at Zhou Wen before quickly escaping amid the blood rain. Soon, she disappeared.</p>
<p>“Just you wait, I’ll be back.” A charming voice drifted from the blood rain, gradually becoming indiscernible.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat in the pool of blood as he gasped for air. What had happened moments ago had been too intense. It made his heart palpitate and relax repeatedly. He felt his blood pressure was so bad that his blood vessels were about to burst.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, what kind of treasure is that? Why is it so strange?” Lu Yunxian looked at the piece of paper in Zhou Wen’s hand and the words on it with an odd expression.</p>
<p>“How would I know?” Zhou Wen folded the piece of paper and placed it back into the box.</p>
<p>He did not tell Lu Yunxian that the piece of paper was given to him by Wang Mingyuan. According to what he knew, although Wang Mingyuan’s theoretical knowledge could be said to be a grandmaster of a generation, his cultivation level only placed him as an ordinary Epic.</p>
<p>Yet, by just writing those words, he was able to suppress such a terrifying Epic creature. It made the Mei have no choice but to kowtow and beg for mercy. How was this an ordinary Epic level? It was simply terrifying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to let others know of this matter. Furthermore, he had no idea why Wang Mingyuan’s words possessed such extraordinary power.</p>
<p>As for why Wang Mingyuan only restrained without killing, leaving the opponent a chance of survival, Zhou Wen could only guess that Wang Mingyuan probably didn’t want him to abuse the power in those words. Therefore, he left the words “beg for mercy,” allowing a restrained creature to have a chance of survival.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know how powerful the words were, but against an ordinary Epic creature, it could be considered another life-saving charm. It was extremely important to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, let’s go.” Zhou Wen endured the pain and stood up from the mud.</p>
<p>“Can you still walk?” Lu Yunxian rushed forward to support Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“I have to. The principal is still waiting for the stone artifact to save his life. I have to take it over.” Zhou Wen got Doctor Darkness to carry him.</p>
<p>“The principal?” Lu Yunxian was first taken aback, momentarily unable to figure out who Zhou Wen was referring to.</p>
<p>“The missing old Mr. Ouyang. I believe Madam Lan should be trapped with him.” Zhou Wen couldn’t forget saving the former principal. Others were secondary, so he blurted it out without paying attention.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian did not think too much about it as he nodded and said, “Madam Lan and Old Master Ouyang might be trapped in the passageway. Let’s rush over now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had little combat strength and was weak, but he wasn’t too worried. At present, there were only three dimensional creatures —Chi, Mei, and Wangliang-on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness had an effective advantage over Wangliang, and he still had a Purple Air Bell that was effective against Chi. With that paper slip on him, he wasn’t afraid of the Mei.</p>
<p>At least they would not be in too much danger before they arrived at the ruins.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen was most worried about was not finding An Sheng and company at the ruins. If An Sheng and company had entered the ruins, it would be useless even if he held the stone artifact. He would probably have to enter by himself.</p>
<p>“Hold on.” Zhou Wen called out to Lu Yunxian and got Doctor Darkness to carry him towards the dead Stone Chi.</p>
<p>Due to the intense battle just now, Zhou Wen hadn’t checked to see if the Stone Chi had dropped anything.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian had forgotten about the matter. Seeing how Zhou Wen wasn’t able to take action, he hurriedly walked over and moved the rocks aside to see if there were any crystal-like objects inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lu Yunxian’s eyes lit up. Beneath a rock was a gray stone egg. It was about the size of a fist, like a gray frosted cobblestone.</p>
<p>“A Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian were delighted.</p>
<p>With the Stone Chi so powerful, the Companion Egg it dropped wouldn’t be weak as long as Zhou Wen’s luck wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, keep the Companion Egg well. This Companion Egg is no trifling matter. In the future, it will definitely be of great help when you hatch it after advancing to the Epic stage.” Lu Yunxian had seen the might of the Stone Chi and knew that the Companion Beast was no trifling matter.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded and took the Companion Egg before letting Doctor Darkness carry him on their journey.</p>
<p>It was dark, and in the midst of a rain of blood, Lu Yunxian walked ahead while Doctor Darkness followed behind with an umbrella in one hand to shield Zhou Wen from the rain.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held his cell phone and looked at the Stone Chi egg. Indeed, there was information about it.</p>
<p>Mutated Stone Chi: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Stone Beast Ghost</p>
<p>Life Soul: Petrified Dragon’s Son</p>
<p>Strength: 40</p>
<p>Speed: 34</p>
<p>Constitution: 40</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 40</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Stone Laser, Earthly Spear Formation.</p>
<p>Companion Form: Stone Armor</p>
<p>It was a powerful Companion Beast with three of its stats reaching the limit of the Epic stage at 40 points. It also possessed two offensive skills. Furthermore, with its Life Providence and Life Soul, unless one encountered a nemesis, they were considered top-grade Companion Beasts at the Epic stage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhou Wen’s current Primordial Energy was insufficient for him to incubate such a top-grade Epic Companion Beast. All he could do was put it into the chaos space.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lay on the back of Doctor Darkness and took out his cell phone to continue gaming. With Doctor Darkness shielding him from the elements, he was rather comfortable.</p>
<p>With his attention focused on the game, the pain was greatly alleviated for him.</p>
<p>What Zhou Wen wanted to do now was to find the source of the beheading power in the ruins and come up with a solution to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If An Sheng and company had really entered the ruins, he could only take the stone artifact in. If he couldn’t find the source of the beheading power, he wouldn’t be able to enter at all. Even if he rushed in recklessly, he would only be sending himself to his death. It was meaningless.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian walked for quite a while and, noticing that Zhou Wen wasn’t speaking, he turned to look at him. He realized that Zhou Wen was being carried on Doctor Darkness’s back while he gamed fanatically. He couldn’t help but marvel inwardly, As expected of Young Master Wen. I would never be able to game with such a relaxed mindset in such a place. It’s no wonder he has such achievements at such a young age.</p>
<p>The human psyche was a very strange thing. When one decided that someone wasn’t good, then, no matter what he did, it was not good. However, once one had decided that the person was outstanding, one would feel that whatever he did was good and would come up with thousands of explanations.</p>
<p>The present Lu Yunxian was a perfect example. No matter what Zhou Wen did, he found it extremely sublime and profound.</p>
<p>I hope Ah Sheng hasn’t entered the ruins yet. Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.</p>
<h3 id='chapter276'>Chapter 276 Realmwind</h3>
<p>Since Ghost Bride didn’t dare enter the underground tunnel, Zhou Wen could only let her circle the interior of the ruins.</p>
<p>The entire ruin consisted mainly of broken stone walls and pillars in an area spanning a radius of more than ten kilometers. There was no dimensional creature to be seen. Even the blood rain’s scale reduced significantly.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride had already searched the ruins several times, but Zhou Wen still failed to discover the root of the problem. When he sent Companion Beasts in, all of them were beheaded apart from Ghost Bride.</p>
<p>It’s impossible that there aren’t any clues. Since Ouyang Lan and Ah Sheng can enter, it means that they must have discovered the source of the beheading power. Zhou Wen repeated, again and again, allowing his Companion Beasts to enter one after another. Then, he scrutinized how they were beheaded, hoping to find clues.</p>
<p>It was true that nothing could be seen with his eyes, but after repeatedly listening with Truth Listener, Zhou Wen finally discovered the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Every time Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast was beheaded, he would hear a faint sound.</p>
<p>The sound was not produced from the severing of flesh and bone during the beheading. Instead, it was an extremely concealed sound that sounded like a breeze.</p>
<p>However, it would be strange if that was the wind. As the ruins were very strange, even the blood rain outside suddenly stopped wafting in. Blood rain descended slowly like snowflakes, with no signs of a wind blowing.</p>
<p>However, when the pets were beheaded, Zhou Wen heard the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>After letting the Gold-Armored Beast enter the ruins again, Zhou Wen closed his eyes and listened attentively with Truth Listener’s powers.</p>
<p>As the Gold-Armored Beast walked, something suddenly lopped off its head, but there was nothing there.</p>
<p>Wind… It’s indeed a wind… Zhou Wen suddenly widened his eyes as the blood-colored avatar looked at the Gold-Armored Beast’s corpse in the ruins.</p>
<p>At the instant the Gold-Armored Beast was beheaded, Truth Listener’s abilities had allowed him to capture traces of the wind. However, the wind that appeared out of nowhere did not come from the outside world. It was as if it had suddenly appeared beside the Gold-Armored Beast’s neck, chopping off its head.</p>
<p>Wind can’t be generated for no reason, but no wind blew from the outside towards the Gold-Armored Beast. Where did the wind come from? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.</p>
<p>“Commander Lu, do you know how winds are formed?” Zhou Wen suddenly looked up and asked Lu Yunxian who was ahead of him.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian thought for a moment and said, “According to the scientific explanations from the past, wind is a natural phenomenon caused by the flow of air. Under normal circumstances, the movement of the wind is facilitated by the heat of the sun. The temperature on the surface rises due to the sun’s rays, causing the temperature of the air above the surface to expand and rise…”</p>
<p>After explaining how winds were formed, Lu Yunxian said, “I wasn’t a stellar student in school, so I only remember this. Young Master Wen, is what I said correct?”</p>
<p>“I’m a lousier student.” Zhou Wen fell into deep thought after hearing Lu Yunxian’s words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t sense any abnormality in temperature while inside the ruins. Furthermore, the blood rain poured straight down, so there weren’t any signs of airflow. He really couldn’t figure out how the wind could appear out of thin air.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Lu continued, “But in this era, there are many things that cannot be explained by science. Speaking of the wind, I do recall something. When Madam Lan was watching the blood rain, she said that the blood rain might be the Baneful Blood Rain produced by Chiyou’s subordinate, Lord of the Rain. And equal to him, is another mighty god also subordinate to Chiyou named Wind God. He was proficient in the wind. Madam Lan said that he possesses a wind force known as Realmwind.”</p>
<p>“What’s Realmwind?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked as he realized something.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Lu’s words reminded him that Wind God and Lord of the Rain were of equal ranks. The entire ancient battlefield was enveloped by the blood rain, but he did not feel the power of the wind.</p>
<p>The wind that appeared out of nowhere in the ruin might have something to do with Wind God.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m not too sure either. I’ve only heard Madam Lan’s comments.” After a pause, Battalion Commander Lu continued, “Wind is the result of the flow of air. However, this is in regards to one world. If two different worlds have a passageway open up, then the air in the two worlds will flow as well. Wind God possesses this ability that’s known as Realmwind. As for how Wind God does it, or if he and Realmwind even exist, it eludes me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was in thought as he felt that Commander Lu’s words had inspired him greatly</p>
<p>The wind couldn’t have been generated out of thin air, but in the ruins, wind had appeared out of thin air. It could be explained if the wind was generated from the connection between different worlds.</p>
<p>Could it be that the beheading in the ruins is secretly done by Wind God? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he thought about it. For a legendary figure like Wind God, there was no need for him to resort to such tiny tricks. Just a casual blow from him would probably be enough to kill countless Epic experts.</p>
<p>If it isn’t Wind God, it would have to be a dimensional creature with similar Realmwind powers. It would definitely be hidden in the ruins. As long as I can find it and kill it, I can safely enter the ruins. But how can I find it? Zhou Wen felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride had already searched the ruins several times, but she had not found anything. It was very likely that the wind-elemental creature hid in the dark, making it difficult to find its location.</p>
<p>If only Banana Fairy were here. She’s also of the wind element. She should be able to achieve a certain effect. Zhou Wen glanced at the chaos space and saw that the tornado was still swirling.</p>
<p>As for the Goddess of Wind’s Protection, the necklace was no longer effective after Banana Fairy ate the gem. In fact, it did not even have the ability to imbue immunity to wind-elemental powers.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen experimented the entire way and encountered two Wangliang en route. They were killed by Doctor Darkness, so they didn’t encounter any more trouble. The Mei had vanished as though she had really escaped.</p>
<p>When the two arrived in front of the ruins, they saw several tents, as well as people in custom raincoats patrolling.</p>
<p>The prowler was first taken aback when he saw Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian. Then, he walked over and asked, “Zhou Wen, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Zhao Xin, where’s An Sheng?” Zhou Wen recognized Zhao Xin and couldn’t help but feel delighted. Since Zhao Xin was still here, An Sheng and company might not have entered the ruins yet.</p>
<p>“Adjutant An has gone into the ruins with the rest. They have been in there for almost a day. Young Master Wen, it’s best you go back quickly. It’s too dangerous here,” Zhao Xin said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen frowned and continued asking, “Isn’t there a terrifying beheading power in the ruins? How did An Sheng and company enter?”</p>
<h3 id='chapter277'>Chapter 277 Testing</h3>
<p>“It’s indeed very strange. In the beginning, we sent quite a number of Companion Beasts in, but every one of them had their heads beheaded. Only two of them managed to survive. Adjutant An said that it’s called Wind of Space, and it’s a powerful wind generated by the exchange of air between two different spaces. As it comes and goes without a trace, one will find it difficult to withstand it unless they are completely without flaw.”</p>
<p>Zhao Xin paused for a moment before continuing, “Adjutant An finally thought of a way and got two Epic experts, who are proficient in spatial powers, to be responsible for disrupting the spatial order, so that the Wind of Space cannot be formed quickly. After trying it out, we realized that this method is indeed effective. It’s just that the two of them can only protect limited areas, so we can’t send everyone in. Me and two others could only stay guard here and await Adjutant An’s return.”</p>
<p>“Did An Sheng say which part of the ruins he’s taking the rest to?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Adjutant An didn’t say anything. He only said that he wanted to search for Madam Lan and Old Master Ouyang in the ruins. He didn’t tell us exactly where he went.” Zhao Xin shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the distant ruins and felt a little worried. Although he knew that there was indeed a power similar to Realmwind in the ruins, Zhou Wen didn’t have spatial powers, nor did he have the ability to stop the Realmwind. Even if he knew its traits, he was still unable to withstand them.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Zhao Xin.</p>
<p>“I have something here that needs to be given to An Sheng. It might be of help towards rescuing Madam Lan. Do you have any way of contacting him?” Zhou Wen asked vaguely when he saw the other two Epic experts who had stayed behind come out. However, he didn’t mention the stone artifact and made a vague comment.</p>
<p>“There’s too much interference here. Communication devices are useless. Unless they come out, I’m afraid there’s no way to contact them,” said Zhao Xin.</p>
<p>When the other two saw Zhou Wen, they were immediately alarmed. They pointed at him and said, “You aren’t wearing a raincoat. How are you not infected by the virus?”</p>
<p>Zhao Xin was taken aback when he heard that. Only then did he realize that Zhou Wen was only wearing ordinary armor without a raincoat.</p>
<p>Looking at the shape of his armor, it was impossible to cover all his body parts. He would definitely be tainted by the blood.</p>
<p>“I have a way to counter the blood rain, so don’t worry about me. Leave a tent for me. I need some rest,” Zhou Wen said. He needed to wait for his injuries to recover and be combat-fit before he could think of a way to deal with the Realmwind. If not, he would be sending himself to his death.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin pointed at one of the tents and said, “That’s Adjutant An’s tent. Just stay in his.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he entered immediately.</p>
<p>The tent was clean and tidy, and there was even a small battery-powered lamp. Beside it were some books and a small incense burner.</p>
<p>An Sheng actually hadn’t minded taking so many things to such a place. Zhou Wen found a spot to sit down as he circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to heal his injured body before he continued gaming.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company led Lu Yunxian into another tent and said with a smile, “Commander Lu, it must have been hard on you to bring Zhou Wen to such a dangerous place. You must have suffered a lot on the way, right?”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian glanced at Zhao Xin and company and said coldly, “This is my duty. And without Young Master Wen, I wouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>The three of them were taken aback. Zhao Xin looked at Lu Yunxian and asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>However, Lu Yunxian did not answer and only said, “All of you, get ready. When Young Master Wen recovers, we will follow him into the ruins to look for Adjutant An.”</p>
<p>The three of them looked at Lu Yunxian as though they were looking at a lunatic. Zhao Xin licked his lips and said, “I know that you members of the Sunset army are famous for being fearless even in the face of death, but do you know how terrifying the spatial wind in the ruin is? Do you know how many powerful Companion Beasts died when we first probed the area? That’s not a place anyone can enter as they please.”</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen will think of a way,” Lu Yunxian said indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company exchanged looks. They felt that Lu Yunxian must have a screw loose. What kind of solution could one come up with for such a place? Without the ability to control the Wind of Space, entering meant having a death wish. There was no other way.</p>
<p>No matter how smart Zhou Wen was, he didn’t have spatial powers. Furthermore, he was at the Legendary stage. How could he safely enter the ruin?</p>
<p>Due to the difference in opinion, Zhao Xin and company decided to ignore Lu Yunxian and minded their own business.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t manage to come up with any solutions either. Despite knowing the traits of Realmwind, the knowledge didn’t help in restraining it.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen only came up with the solution of using Ghost Steps to dodge at the instant the Realmwind was generated, preventing them from hitting him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen had tried several times in-game and the difficulty was extremely high. The spot where the Realmwind appeared almost clung to his skin, and a 0.01 second delay in his reaction time meant him dying. He barely managed to dodge once or twice every ten times. Even so, luck played a factor.</p>
<p>Ghost Steps was very fast, but that was referring to speed. Zhou Wen’s reaction speed wouldn’t increase because of the Ghost Steps, so his reaction speed was clearly insufficient against the sudden Realmwind.</p>
<p>I have to be able to dodge the Realmwind. How can I react faster and avoid the Realmwind safely? Zhou Wen constantly experimented in-game.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was fully focused on his experiments in-game. When Zhao Xin and company delivered his meal, they smiled without saying a word when they saw Zhou Wen sitting there gaming on his phone.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s usage of his phone was nothing out of the blue to them, nor did they find it amiss. However, they found it amusing when they connected such actions to Lu Yunxian’s words.</p>
<p>When they returned to the tent that the four of them shared, they saw that Lu Yunxian was still making preparations, as though he really was prepared to set off for the ruins.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin couldn’t help but laugh, “I say, Commander Lu, Zhou Wen is still gaming. I don’t think he will be able to head to the ruins anytime soon. You should rest for a while.”</p>
<p>“We will be going,” Lu Yunxian said calmly.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin didn’t say anything further in response to Lu Yunxian’s stubbornness. He lay on the mat and took out his cell phone. He also found a game to play.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he really liked gaming, but that he was under too much pressure in such a place. If he didn’t find something to do, he was afraid that he would go crazy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly honed his ability to react at the precipice of life and death. He needed to make a perfect plan to enter the ruins. Not a single mistake could be made.</p>
<p>In the game, he could afford death if he made a mistake. He could respawn with a drop of blood, but in reality, he only had one life. If he died, that was it—there were no second chances.</p>
<p>What can I do to ensure perfection and make zero mistakes? Zhou Wen soon discovered that with his own reaction, it was impossible for him to make no mistakes even if he practiced to the extreme.</p>
<p>There would always be one or two mistakes every ten attempts because the speed of the Realmwind had exceeded the reaction limits. No matter how well Zhou Wen did, it was impossible for him to always exceed his usual limits and avoid the Realmwind’s attack.</p>
<h3 id='chapter278'>Chapter 278 Banana Fairy Evolution</h3>
<p>If my reaction can’t be perfect, then I have to think of a way to predict when the Realmwind will appear. Zhou Wen knew that unless he advanced to the Epic stage, it would be impossible for him to completely avoid all the Realmwind attacks.</p>
<p>It’s already too late for me to react when Truth Listener hears the sound of the Realmwind. But what can I do to discover where it comes from? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Eyes were definitely out of the question. It was impossible to see the Realmwind. Using one’s body to feel it would be even more ridiculous. When the Realmwind touched his body, it was the moment he was beheaded.</p>
<p>What should I do? How do I predict the moment when the Realmwind appears? Zhou Wen repeatedly tried, but the outcome wasn’t ideal.</p>
<p>Hence, he removed Truth Listener’s companion form and allowed it to play in the tent. He was accustomed to the convenience that Truth Listener had given him. The sudden loss made Zhou Wen feel like he was blind. Although he could still see with his eyes and hear with ears, he still found it awkward, as though something was missing.</p>
<p>Indeed, I can’t rely too much on a Companion Beast. Otherwise, it will greatly affect my own powers. Zhou Wen took a deep breath and calmed his mind before he once again controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter the ruins.</p>
<p>Truth Listener climbed onto Zhou Wen’s shoulder and scanned its surroundings. When its gaze landed on Zhou Wen’s pocket, its eyes suddenly lit up. With a leap, he jumped into the pocket like a diving athlete.</p>
<p>The pocket contained the stone artifact that Zhou Wen had retrieved.</p>
<p>The monkey-like Truth Listener landed on the stone artifact and used its claws to touch the stone artifact a few times before sticking out its tongue to lick it. As though it wasn’t satisfied, it opened its mouth wide and swallowed the stone artifact.</p>
<p>Its petite body wasn’t even as large as the stone artifact, but it managed to swallow the entire stone artifact with the only clue of its actions: the tiny bump on its abdomen. It was unknown how it managed to do it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was now completely immersed in the game. Furthermore, he had just lost Truth Listener’s listening ability and Doctor Darkness and Truth Listener were guarding the tent. He would know immediately if there was any commotion, so he didn’t think too much about it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen never expected Truth Listener to actually commit embezzlement by swallowing the stone artifact that he had painstakingly retrieved. Then, with four legs raised, Truth Listener collapsed into Zhou Wen’s pocket.</p>
<p>The golden fur on its body gradually turned into a grayish-white stone color that resembled stone. Its entire body rapidly petrified. In a few seconds, it turned into a mini monkey stone sculpture.</p>
<p>However, the change to Truth Listener’s body did not end. It produced a substance similar to a stone pulp from its body. The liquid gradually wrapped around its body and soon, Truth Listener turned into an egg-shaped rock.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no idea of the astonishing changes happening in his pocket. Otherwise, he would definitely have stopped Truth Listener. After all, the stone artifact was key to saving Ouyang Lan and the former principal. He simply couldn’t afford to lose it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen constantly battled as he sensed the impact of the Realmwind on his life. Without Truth Listener’s ability to support him, the blood-colored avatar’s death rate soared once again. Sometimes, it wouldn’t even survive once in ten times.</p>
<p>However, under the stimulation of death, Zhou Wen, without Truth Listener’s support, seemed to vaguely grasp something, but he was unable to confirm it.</p>
<p>As the drops of blood vanished, Zhou Wen’s senses became sharper and sharper. It wasn’t like Truth Listener’s pure sense of hearing. His eyes, nose, ears, and even his skin became more sensitive under the pressure of death. His overall senses were greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to take a step forward. And at the spot where he stood, a stone pillar was sliced off by an invisible Realmwind that appeared out of thin air before it collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>I succeeded! Zhou Wen was delighted. He seemed to have figured out something, but he still needed to prove it with repeated successes.</p>
<p>Over and over again, Zhou Wen constantly dodged the wind. The chances of him being injured by the Realmwind decreased as he finally grasped the key to dodging it.</p>
<p>I’ve finally done it. Zhou Wen was delighted. He wanted to summon Truth Listener back and try to see if he could better predict the appearance of the Realmwind with it.</p>
<p>However, after two summonings, he failed to sense Truth Listener returning to his ears. He could not help but look around. All he saw was Doctor Darkness standing silently in a dark corner, but there was no sign of Truth Listener, nor could he sense where it was.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling puzzled, Zhou Wen’s expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly reached into his pocket and touched it, his expression turning ashen.</p>
<p>The stone artifact was triangular in shape, and the stone that he was touching was clearly shaped like an egg.</p>
<p>He hurriedly took out the stone in his pocket. Indeed, it was a stone egg the size of a fist. However, it emitted the aura of Truth Listener.</p>
<p>I was careless. Why didn’t I guard against this thief!? Zhou Wen regretted his decision.</p>
<p>The situation was very obvious. Truth Listener must have swallowed the stone artifact to cause such a change. Perhaps, it was evolving.</p>
<p>If it was only an ordinary treasure, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been unwilling to part with it no matter how precious it was. He wouldn’t have minded Truth Listener swallowing it since it was his main combat pet.</p>
<p>However, this item might very well be used to save the former principal and Ouyang Lan’s lives. Now that Truth Listener had devoured it, Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p>Smashing the stone egg and see if the stone artifact remains inside? It was naturally infeasible.</p>
<p>I can only take the stone egg in to give it a try. The stone egg should possess the power of a stone artifact. It might be able to replace the stone artifact’s effects. Zhou Wen had no choice but to rely on a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>This time, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He directly placed the stone egg into the chaos space, but when he saw the scene in the chaos space, he couldn’t help but feel delighted</p>
<p>The hurricane that had been spinning around had already weakened. It was getting thinner and thinner as though a wind egg was suspended in the air.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A green light emitted from a crack in the wind egg. Wearing a green robe, Banana Fairy flew out and floated through the air like a fairy in the wind.</p>
<p>She had grown a lot taller, and her every move seemed to have an invisible wind supporting her. It made her clothes dance in the wind, as though a hairdryer was blowing her at all times.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy has finished evolving? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. This was considered the best news in recent times.</p>
<h3 id='chapter279'>Chapter 279 Divine Wind Immortal</h3>
<p>Previously, the banana leaf was only the size of a palm but now it was the size of a normal fan. Banana Fairy had also grown to the size of a doll as she sat on the banana leaf. She fluttered about like a little princess in the wind.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen released her from the chaos space, Banana Fairy flew around him looking very happy.</p>
<p>“Finally.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and Banana Fairy flew over from the banana leaf and landed on Zhou Wen. He immediately felt a breeze surround him, making him cold.</p>
<p>After rubbing Banana Fairy’s head, she transformed into a green stream of light and fused with Zhou Wen’s body, turning back into a banana leaf tattoo.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen dripped a drop of blood on his phone and respawned the blood-colored avatar. He looked at Banana Fairy’s new attributes.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy: Epic (Evolvable)</p>
<p>Life State: Great Yin Spirit Root.</p>
<p>Life Soul: Divine Wind Immortal</p>
<p>Strength: 41</p>
<p>Speed: 41</p>
<p>Constitution: 41</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 41</p>
<p>Talent Skill: Grand Yin Wind</p>
<p>Companion Form: Fan</p>
<p>The attributes were as Zhou Wen expected. They were twice the value of 20 plus 1. Zhou Wen didn’t know what the extra 1 point was for, but he had a nagging feeling that this additional one point wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>The skill was still the single Grand Yin Wind, making Zhou Wen feel a little disappointed. He originally wondered if a new kill would be learned after she evolved, but in the end, she remained with a single skill.</p>
<p>The Great Yin Spirit Root Life Providence didn’t change, but the greatest change to Banana Fairy’s transformation was the addition of a Life Soul. The Divine Wind Immortal undoubtedly had strong effects on the wind element. As for the actual effects, he had to test it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen opened the Zhuolu instance dungeon, hoping to test the power of the Banana Fairy after it evolved.</p>
<p>Soon, he encountered a Wangliang. With a wave of his hand, Banana Fairy appeared in front of him while sitting on a banana leaf. When she saw the Wangliang charging at them, she immediately puffed up her cheeks and pouted her mouth, blowing right at the Wangliang.</p>
<p>An invisible cold wind suddenly blew as the Wangliang’s body was sent flying by the wind. It tumbled far away in the air, and at the same time, its body rapidly froze into an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Wangliang’s body flew for an unknown distance before shattering in the air, raining down ice shards. Even the Wangliang bead inside its body shattered, causing it to die. A dimensional crystal dropped on the ground.</p>
<p>She’s amazing. Is this the suppression that absolute strength brings? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. Having such wind powers made her the strongest Epic creature Zhou Wen had ever seen. Few creatures of the same level could withstand one fanning of hers.</p>
<p>On Banana Fairy’s body, there was an indiscernible wind that flowed. As the wind flowed, Zhou Wen could vaguely see a transparent woman’s figure. She looked like a deity and was likely Banana Fairy’s Life Soul, Divine Wind Immortal.</p>
<p>Originally, Banana Fairy could only use the Grand Yin Wind once and her Primordial Energy would be depleted. However, with the Divine Wind Immortal, Zhou Wen discovered that Banana Fairy’s Primordial Energy was rapidly recovering. It didn’t take long before she could use Grand Yin Wind again.</p>
<p>In that case, Banana Fairy will have a chance of continuously doing battle. Zhou Wen was delighted. Now that Banana Fairy was his strongest combat power, it was much safer to traverse the ancient battlefield with her.</p>
<p>He extended his hand and Banana Fairy transformed into a jade-like fan that landed in his hand. The fan was about the size of a normal fan, unlike the mini-fan from before. It fit perfectly in his hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen examined the banana fan formed by Banana Fairy. It was entirely jade-like and cool to the touch. On the surface of the fan, there was a lady’s portrait. It looked different from the previous banana fan.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if the banana fan would have the same potent effects as Banana Fairy. After all, Banana Fairy had 41 Primordial Energy points, and he only had 21. If he used the Grand Yin Wind skill, there would definitely be a difference in strength.</p>
<p>As he continued forward, he soon ran into a Chi. Zhou Wen used it as an experiment and saw the black dragon Life Soul spew out black smoke. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t use the Purple Air Bell.</p>
<p>Wherever the wind reached, the black smoke was blown back, striking the Chi. Then, it was swept away by the wind.</p>
<p>The black smoke immediately made the Chi fall into a deep slumber. The Grand Yin Wind from the banana fan also caused layers of ice to form outside its body.</p>
<p>However, when Zhou Wen used it, his Grand Yin Wind was indeed much weaker than the Banana Fairy’s. It wasn’t able to directly freeze and shatter the Chi’s body, only managing to send it flying far into the distance.</p>
<p>But even so, Zhou Wen was satisfied. He was only at the Legendary stage. To send an Epic creature like the Chi flying hundreds of feet away using the Grand Yin Wind and freezing it into an ice sculpture was already remarkable.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see if Banana Fairy can resist the Realmwind in the ruins. Zhou Wen rushed to the ruins at full speed. He encountered another Chi on the way and easily slew it. It was effortless.</p>
<p>After arriving outside the ruins once again, Zhou Wen got Banana Fairy to take her original form and enter the ruins with the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept observing his surroundings. He was already very sensitive to the Realmwind. Even without Banana Fairy by his side, he was confident that he could dodge Realmwind’s attacks.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen still wanted to see how Banana Fairy would respond to it.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly felt a minute spatial fluctuation. He knew that it was a sign that a Realmwind was about to appear. Without any hesitation, he dodged, but he didn’t pull Banana Fairy along.</p>
<p>The wind was like a blade as it slashed at Banana Fairy’s neck. However, she didn’t seem to notice it as she sat on the banana leaf and swayed.</p>
<p>It can’t be? How can the wind-elemental Banana Fairy have such a slow reaction towards the Realmwind? Zhou Wen found it strange, but in the next second, his mouth gaped open.</p>
<p>The Realmwind that approached Banana Fairy suddenly spun like an invisible wind blade as it swirled around Banana Fairy’s body, causing the surrounding space to ripple.</p>
<p>With a wave of Banana Fairy’s hand, the Realmwind automatically landed in her palm as though it was a whirling blade that was being controlled by her. It kept spinning until Banana Fairy flicked it, sending it flying off.</p>
<p>Kacha!</p>
<p>A distant stone pillar was sliced apart by the Realmwind. Blood spewed out from it while a strange scream sounded.</p>
<p>“Little Banana, you’re really awesome.” Zhou Wen wished he could summon Banana Fairy over and hug her, planting a deep kiss onto her cheeks.</p>
<p>With Banana Fairy by his side, he was free to enter the ruins. He no longer needed to worry about the terrifying Realmwind.</p>
<h3 id='chapter280'>Chapter 280 Realmwind Insect</h3>
<p>A notification of him killing an Epic Realmwind Insect popped up in-game. Zhou Wen walked towards the stone pillar that had been sliced apart by the Realmwind and saw a hole in the middle. Hidden in it was something that resembled a cricket, but it was more than a foot long. However, it had been halved just like the stone pillar.</p>
<p>So this is what’s causing all the problems inside the ruins. Zhou Wen didn’t expect that an insect like this would have such destructive power.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have Banana Fairy. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy to find it. Zhou Wen got Banana Fairy to continue searching for the Realmwind Insects in the ruins. He planned on killing a few more to confirm whether Banana Fairy could completely repress the Realmwind Insects.</p>
<p>However, Banana Fairy’s performance was better than Zhou Wen had imagined. As long as the Realmwind appeared and wasn’t too far from her, it would be controlled by her and become her weapon. She easily found the Realmwind Insects that were hiding in stone columns or walls while releasing Realmwind. All of them were slain.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>When he killed the sixth Realmwind Insect, Zhou Wen heard a familiar chime and a crystal dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the crystal. It resembled an ant’s egg and was the size of a chicken’s egg. There was the shadow of a Realmwind Insect inside. It was clearly a Primordial Energy Crystal with the name Realmwind Insect Crystal.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Realmwind Insect’s Primordial Energy skill is? It can’t be Realmwind, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself as he got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Realmwind Insect Crystal, hoping to see what skill he would receive.</p>
<p>However, the system popped up a notification: ‘Requires 21 Strength and 9 Wind stats to absorb the Realmwind Insect Crystal. Insufficient Wind stats. Cannot be refined and absorbed.’</p>
<p>It actually needs a Wind stat? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He had an inkling what it was—it was probably similar to the Poison stat he had obtained from his previous absorption.</p>
<p>Epic Primordial Energy Skills seemed to have all sorts of requirements, unlike in the past where he could just master one if he so wished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had killed quite a number of Wangliang, but he only had one Poison crystal drop. The later ones were all four basic stat crystals. It was obvious that special stat crystals didn’t have high drop rates, likewise for the Wind stat crystal. It wasn’t easy to have one drop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the Realmwind Insect Crystal and felt dismayed. If he left it on the ground, it might be gone in a respawn, but he couldn’t absorb it even if he held it in his hand. There was no inventory in the game.</p>
<p>If only there was a Chaos Bead in the game. Zhou Wen had no choice but to hold onto the Realmwind Insect Crystal and wander the ruins killing all the Realmwind Insects.</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen expected, a few basic stat crystals dropped, but not a single Wind stat crystal dropped. The drop rate was rather low.</p>
<p>However, this also had to do with the rarity of Realmwind Insects. Zhou Wen and Banana Fairy toured the ruins and only found 17 Realmwind Insects. They couldn’t find any more Realmwind Insects no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>However, once the instance dungeon was refreshed, the Realmwind Insect Crystal in the blood-colored avatar’s hand disappeared along with the refresh. Its drop rate was similarly low, making Zhou Wen reluctant to waste such an opportunity.</p>
<p>It’s such a waste letting it be deleted in the refresh. I’ll make a trip to the ruins in real life and kill the Realmwind Insects to see if they can drop Wind stat crystals. Zhou Wen made up his mind-he was going to hunt Realmwind Insects in real life.</p>
<p>With Banana Fairy around, as long as he didn’t enter the underground tunnel, there shouldn’t be any danger. He could also take a look and see if An Sheng and the rest were still inside the ruins.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t entered the tunnel, he could meet up with them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that they had already entered the underground tunnel. It was highly likely that he had to go down the tunnel as well.</p>
<p>After packing his things, Zhou Wen left the tent. He planned on informing Lu Yunxian and the others to remain while he made a trip to the ruins.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company were chatting when they saw Zhou Wen coming over. Zhao Xin asked casually, “With your serious injuries, why aren’t you resting in the tent? Just shout if you need anything.”</p>
<p>“My injuries are much better. I want to go into the ruins to take a look. Stay here. If An Sheng comes back, tell him not to enter the ruins again. Wait here for me.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company widened their eyes. Previously, Lu Yunxian had mentioned that Zhou Wen would definitely head to the ruins, but they didn’t believe him. Now, they had no choice but to believe him.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, there’s the strange spatial wind in the ruins. It’s useless even if you go. You will just suffer a pointless death,” said Zhao Xin.</p>
<p>“I’ve already thought of a way to deal with spatial winds. You don’t have to worry about me.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting them go, so he didn’t stay any longer and walked away.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’ll go with you.” Lu Yunxian was already prepared, so he chased after him.</p>
<p>The remaining three looked at each other. Finally, it was Zhao Xin who said, “Let’s go and take a look outside the ruins. If they die in the ruins, we might be able to find a way to collect their corpses.”</p>
<p>“Brother Zhao, do you think Zhou Wen has really thought of a way to crack the spatial wind?” asked another person.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? Adjutant An couldn’t even crack it, and Zhou Wen doesn’t cultivate in wind-elemental Primordial Energy Arts, and he’s only at the Legendary stage. How can he possibly succeed?” Zhao Xin wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>“If Zhou Wen really cracked it, should we follow him in?” the person asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to happen, so why are you thinking so much? Let’s go take a look first.” Zhao Xin then put on his raincoat and the three of them left the tent together.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the ruins, Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian had already entered. Thankfully, the blood rain inside the ruins was lighter, allowing them to see their figures clearly.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, Battalion Commander Lu, we’re here to receive you. Call for help if you need anything.” Zhao Xin didn’t dare enter the ruins as he shouted to Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen ignored him. He had persuaded Lu Yunxian against following him, but Lu Yunxian refused to return. All Zhou Wen could do was let follow him into the ruins.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Realmwind Insects are located in the same spots as in-game? Zhou Wen looked at a stone pillar. If the location was the same, he could directly go up to kill the Realmwind Insects without waiting for them to release the Realmwind.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Zhou Wen clenched the hilt of his Bamboo Blade and slowly approached the stone pillar. Regardless of whether they were in the same position as the game, there was no harm in trying</p>
<h3 id='chapter281'>Chapter 281 Young Overseer</h3>
<p>When Lu Yunxian saw Zhou Wen grip his hilt, he believed that Zhou Wen had discovered an enemy. He hurriedly circulated his Primordial Energy Art and looked around warily.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company tensed up as well. Although Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian entered on their own accord, absolving them of any fault if they ended up dying, no one was willing to see their own kind beheaded in such a strange place.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s figure vanished as he appeared in front of a broken stone pillar like a ghost. With sabers tightly gripped with both hands, he slashed at the stone pillar in front of him as a sanguine arc beam slashed out.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The stone pillar was split into two by Zhou Wen’s saber. The cut was as smooth as a mirror, but blood spewed out from the cut. Lu Yunxian and the other three were stunned.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, is this the source of the strange spatial wind in the ruins?” Lu Yunxian asked as he walked up to take a look at the Realmwind Insect’s corpse.</p>
<p>As Zhou Wen rummaged through the corpse of the Realmwind Insect, he nodded. “That’s right. There should be more than one. Don’t go too far away from me, lest something happens.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Realmwind Insect did not drop a crystal or a Companion Egg.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen led Lu Yunxian forward, Zhao Xin and company wore odd expressions outside.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhao, that punk, Zhou Wen, wasn’t bullsh*ting. Even Adjutant An failed to find the dimensional creatures in the ruins. Yet, he managed to find them. It looks like he’s really capable. Should we go in?” one of them asked Zhao Xin.</p>
<p>“What are we going in for? To send ourselves to our deaths? If there’s one, who knows how many of them there are? If they make a mistake, they’ll still die in there. Since Adjutant An got us to stand guard here, we’ll wait here for them. Why should we risk our lives?” Zhao Xin said as he walked back. However, Zhou Wen’s slash kept surfacing in his mind. He couldn’t help but mumble, “That punk is a little odd.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t expect the location of the Realmwind Insects to be identical to the ones in the game. He didn’t give the Realmwind Insects a chance to use Realmwind, killing them within their stone crevices.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian followed Zhou Wen and watched as he charged forward as though he was a prescient god. The Bamboo Blade saw blood every time it was unsheathed. It killed the strange insects hidden in the rocks. The way he looked at Zhou Wen became odder.</p>
<p>He had also seriously observed his surroundings, but he didn’t notice anything abnormal. It was impossible for him to know where the Realmwind Insects were hidden. Yet, Zhou Wen struck with his saber with zero hesitation, decisively killing every Realmwind Insect.</p>
<p>The ruin, that was originally enveloped in horror, seemed to become less terrifying because of the youth in front of him. In Lu Yunxian’s eyes, Zhou Wen seemed to emit light and warmth, illuminating this land of terror.</p>
<p>This feeling… is so familiar… I’ve experienced it before… Lu Yunxian couldn’t help but be reminded of the past when he charged into a dimensional zone with An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>At that time, An Tianzuo was probably a little older than Zhou Wen. He was almost twenty. Back then, An Tianzuo had already been the head of the An family for several years and was known by everyone in Luoyang. They addressed him as “young overseer.”</p>
<p>However, An Tianzuo back then wasn’t as accepted as he was now. Even the An family had many members against him.</p>
<p>Once, a new dimensional zone appeared in Luoyang’s south district, causing a large group of citizens to suffer a calamity. An Tianzuo wanted to send men to suppress the dimensional zone in the south, but because of the clan’s obstruction, only a small number of soldiers were sent.</p>
<p>An Tianzuo had no choice but to personally lead the troops into the dimensional zone. Back then, Lu Yunxian was not a battalion commander, but a mere section commander. They had four sections that followed An Tianzuo into the perilous dimensional zone where they encountered many bizarre dimensional creatures.</p>
<p>The reinforcements that should have arrived didn’t get there on time.</p>
<p>Back then, many soldiers had already given up hope. They thought that they would definitely die in battle. Even Lu Yunxian had thought the same.</p>
<p>However, it was that young man who held a revolver in one hand and a large sword in the other; he led them through the dimensional zone, storming a bloody path through the dimensional beast horde and led them out.</p>
<p>At that time, An Tianzuo was like the youth in front of him, emitting light and heat like the sun.</p>
<p>After that battle, many of the surviving soldiers and low-ranking officers, like Lu Yunxian, later became the bedrock of the Sunset army. They were also very loyal to An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>The first thing An Tianzuo did when he returned to Luoyang was to rush to the residence of the An family’s elder, An Huaishan, who had violated the military order. He then personally slew all the men who were above sixteen years of age.</p>
<p>That night, the An family’s blood flowed like a river. The man who used to be like the sun had his military uniform covered in blood. He was like the devil that made it impossible for anyone to approach him. Only a handsome youth followed behind him, carrying a gunny sack on his back walking to the martyrs’ cemetery.</p>
<p>They walked all the way, blood dripping from the gunny sack. When they arrived at the warriors’ tomb in the dimensional zone, the handsome youth opened the cloth bag and bloody heads rolled out, stunning everyone.</p>
<p>An Huaishan’s family-from An Huaishan to his 16-year-old grandson-and all the men who had been part of the military were beheaded. All their heads were here, and they were hung in front of the mass grave to honor the deceased warriors.</p>
<p>After that, An Tianzuo took control of the An family’s power one step at a time. The Sunset army also gradually became synonymous with An Tianzuo.</p>
<p>It’s been so many years… I’ve never seen anyone like him again… Lu Yunxian looked at Zhou Wen with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the environment they had grown up in, this youth and An Tianzuo had completely different personalities, but when they put their mind to doing something, they were surprisingly similar. It was as if they could do anything they wanted. They exuded a blinding radiance that was fatally attractive to others.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slashed open the stone pillar with his saber. A Realmwind Insect had its body cleaved apart, causing a rhombic crystal to roll out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the crystal. The crystal was transparent and flawless, and there seemed to be wind swirling within it. It was obvious that it was different from an ordinary crystal.</p>
<p>Could this be a wind stat crystal? Zhou Wen hurriedly picked it up before secretly snapping it with his phone.</p>
<p>‘Wind Crystal: 11.’</p>
<p>The information displayed on the phone delighted Zhou Wen as he secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>If there were only 17 Realmwind Insects in real life, with him already killing 13, he would have to give up on the Realmwind Insect Crystal in-game if the wind stat crystal didn’t drop.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, he immediately absorbed the Wind Crystal. He felt a faint breeze enter his body, and his attributes had an additional wind element with a value of 11.</p>
<p>Having reached the requirements needed to absorb the Realmwind Insect Crystal, Zhou Wen chose to absorb it. The crystal immediately turned into transparent wind that permeated the blood-colored avatar’s body, forming a new Primordial Energy path and circulation in his body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter282'>Chapter 282 Boomerang Wind</h3>
<p>‘Absorbed Realmwind Insect Crystal. Attained wind-elemental Primordial Energy Skill: Boomerang Wind.’</p>
<p>It’s not Realmwind? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He had already seen how powerful it was, so he had been hoping that it would be Realmwind, but to his dismay, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Scrutinizing the Boomerang Wind’s information, he found that it was a passive wind-elemental Primordial Energy Skill that couldn’t be used actively. It had to meet certain conditions before it could be used.</p>
<p>Boomerang Wind: Requires saber aura-type Primordial Energy Skill to trigger, creating a wind with a boomerang effect.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Boomerang Wind effect was, but thankfully, he knew a saber aura-type Primordial Energy Skill. It was the Astral Slash Blade that he had obtained from the Mutated Demonized General. He had fused it with two other skills to form the Demonic Astral Wheel. Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it could still be considered a saber aura-type Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Since I’ve learned it, I might as well give it a try. Zhou Wen continued walking forward until he reached a Realmwind Insect’s hiding spot. As he drew his saber, he used Demonic Astral Wheel. A sanguine arc slashed out from the Bamboo Blade like a razor blade, slicing the stone pillar into two and killing the Realmwind Insect inside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sheathed his saber and was about to head over to check the corpse of the Realmwind Insect to see if there were any crystals inside when he saw a sanguine beam flash. The Astral Slash Blade he had slashed out had flown back, but thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted fast enough and ducked in time. Otherwise, he might have been hit by his own Primordial Energy Skill.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The Demonic Astral Wheel slashed at the stone wall behind Zhou Wen, splitting the stone wall in half before it vanished.</p>
<p>So this is the boomerang effect? That’s quite interesting. Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. Typical Primordial Energy Skills were uncontrollable once they were slashed out.</p>
<p>But with Boomerang Wind, it gave him the possibility of controlling the Demonic Astral Wheel he had slashed out.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, your saber aura is so strange. It’s similar to the legendary Cyclic Saber Aura, but it’s also different. Cyclic Saber Aura achieves victory through artifice. The saber aura is elusive because of the curved trajectory it takes, but the destructive force is lacking. But for yours, it’s extremely domineering while being bizarre. It really catches one off guard. If I hadn’t seen it, I would never expect the saber aura to return. There’s a high chance of me being heavily injured or even dying,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“I’ve only just learned it and haven’t mastered it well. Sorry for making a fool of myself,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then you have to practice properly. Such a technique is often very effective on the battlefield.” Lu Yunxian said seriously, “Combat on the battlefield emphasizes a one-hit kill. Everyone will fight with all their might, but to have a slash suddenly appearing behind them is not something many will be able to dodge.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded. “We’ll talk about it later. It’s more important to find An Sheng and the rest now.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was rather familiar with the interior of the ruins and had deliberately taken a detour to kill the Realmwind Insects. Now that he had obtained the Wind Crystal, he stopped taking the detour and headed straight for the entrance to the passageway.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, could that be the underground entrance Liu Chengzhi… no… the Mei mentioned…” Lu Yunxian said as he pointed at a dilapidated building.</p>
<p>The structure was squarish like a stone box with only one empty side. From there, they could see a stone staircase leading underground</p>
<p>On both sides of the stone steps, there were two strange stone statues. The statue on the left had a tiger-like body, but on its back was a pair of wings. On the right was a bird-like statue, but on its head were two ox-like horns.</p>
<p>“It should be here.” Zhou Wen obviously knew that this was the entrance to the underground tunnel. He had been here many times in-game, but he just never entered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed that he didn’t see An Sheng and company. As such, he had no choice but to enter the passageway to find them.</p>
<p>I wonder if this item can be used as a replacement for the stone artifact? Zhou Wen looked at the stone egg in the chaos space and felt somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’ll go in and take a look.” Lu Yun said first.</p>
<p>“Don’t go in now. It’s dangerous here. It doesn’t matter if we fall in, but if we lose the stone artifact, it won’t be worth it,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do?” Lu Yunxian asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait for a day or two. If An Sheng doesn’t come out, we’ll enter.” Zhou Wen needed time to understand the situation in the underground tunnel, or he would be courting death.</p>
<p>After all, he was only at the Legendary stage and his cultivation level wasn’t strong enough. He could not barge in forcefully like An Sheng and Ouyang Lan. If an accident happened, he might not be able to handle any unexpected situations.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian followed Zhou Wen’s lead. Since Zhou Wen had said so, he had no objections.</p>
<p>“Stay guard here and wait for An Sheng and the rest to come out. I’ll clean up the rest of the insects in the ruins to prevent them from encountering any trouble after they come out,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave. However, he suddenly heard a strange noise from the underground tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen cocked his head to the side to listen. The sound was like a train moving on steel tracks. It sounded rhythmic, as though a train was running underground. The sound grew louder, giving the feeling that a train might rush up the pitch-black stone steps at any moment.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that Truth Listener is evolving. Otherwise, with its abilities, I could tell what was going on inside. Zhou Wen was already beginning to miss Truth Listener’s ability. It could resolve many problems.</p>
<p>“If I remember correctly, this place doesn’t have any train networks. There shouldn’t be any trains here. Could there be something similar to a train in the myths?” Lu Yunxian listened for a while and also heard the sound resembling a train.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say a word. In this era, he wouldn’t find it unbelievable to have a spaceship fly out from underground.</p>
<p>The two of them stared at the stone steps warily. It was pitch-black inside, like the mouth to a hell fiend. They could not see anything except the rumbling noises that grew in intensity. It was as if a train was coming out.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian looked at each other before they retreated to the side. They stood on both sides of the passageway-at least they wouldn’t be hit by a train if it really rushed out.</p>
<p>As the sound approached, Zhou Wen was almost convinced that a train was about to rush out. He could even see the flickering lights of a train in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Is there really a train down there?” Lu Yunxian saw the light as well and couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s a train, but it’s coming out soon. Be careful.” Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness and got him to possess him. Then using Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration, he looked into the dark passageway.</p>
<h3 id='chapter283'>Chapter 283 Strange Underground Vehicle</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes illuminated like two miniature floodlights, shooting out two light beams into the dark tunnel. Although the main purpose of this skill was to see through things, viewing things in the darkness wasn’t too difficult either. The only limitation was that it could only view things that were close by, not something too far away.</p>
<p>The sound of a train in the darkness wasn’t far from the exit. With a glance, Zhou Wen’s expression immediately changed.</p>
<p>There was actually a vehicle in the dark tunnel. It came up from the bottom, it wasn’t a train but a strange vehicle made of stone and wood.</p>
<p>The design of the vehicle looked ancient. It was a square-shaped horse-drawn carriage. However, the vehicle didn’t have any horses or other creatures pulling it. At the front of the carriage was a human-shaped puppet. It stood at a stand at the front of the vehicle, both hands holding onto a crank. Its body moved up and down as it rhythmically rotated the stone crank.</p>
<p>With the rotation of the stone crank, the strange vehicle moved up the stone steps. The stone wheels collided with the edge of the stone steps, producing loud thuds. It moved at a rather slow speed.</p>
<p>Beside the puppet was a wooden rod with a stone lamp hanging from it. The light that Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian saw earlier was emitted from the stone lamp.</p>
<p>Apart from the puppet, there were no other creatures to be seen. It was as if the puppet was driving the vehicle.</p>
<p>The puppet was strange. It looked human, but its face was flat without any facial features, making it look very bizarre.</p>
<p>rre.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen only took a few looks before the strange stone carriage reached the mouth of the entrance. It then slowly came to a stop.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian sized up the strange vehicle warily, but after the carriage left the stone path, it stopped moving. The puppet on it seemed to have used up all its energy. It stopped there and kept the pose of rotating the crank.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian leaped up, but he didn’t approach the vehicle. He only wanted to jump up to see what was inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>“Lu Ning!” After Lu Yunxian reached a certain height, his gaze fell on the back of the vehicle and he screamed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also flew up to look inside. He saw that there was only a woman lying there. She looked like she had passed out. Apart from that, there was nothing else. It was empty inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kind of knew the woman-Lu Ning who had come with An Sheng. Zhou Wen had a deep impression of her, especially her Snow Fox. It had powerful ice elemental powers, making Zhou Wen envious.</p>
<p>“I’ll go see if she’s dead.” Lu Yunxian said as he prepared to jump onto the strange vehicle.</p>
<p>“Don’t go yet.” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the vehicle was a little strange. He stopped Lu Yunxian and used Demonic Astral Wheel to suck at the vehicle.</p>
<p>The unconscious Lu Ning was immediately sucked out by him and she flew towards Zhou Wen’s palm.</p>
<p>With Liu Chengzhi having served his lesson, Zhou Wen was a lot warier. He didn’t touch Lu Ning; instead, he retracted his strength, causing Lu Ning to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if she was dead or not, but she did not react at all when she fell to the ground. She just lay there motionless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen first used the Light of Penetration to look at Lu Ning and discovered that her heart was still beating. Her bodily functions seemed normal.</p>
<p>However, the strange thing was that inside her body, there were many extremely slender worms that looked like snakes squirming along her veins. It looked abnormally terrifying</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had an inkling that the reason Lu Ning was unconscious was probably because of these worms.</p>
<p>The worms were like strands of hair that squirmed through the blood vessels. Even her heart and organs were filled with them.</p>
<p>“She’s still alive and doesn’t seem to be injured. Her heart is also beating. For some reason, she’s unconscious,” Lu Yunxian said as he checked Lu Ning’s body.</p>
<p>“Her raincoat has been torn, so she can’t avoid the blood rain here. It’s not convenient to treat her here. Take her back to the tent first. We can ask her what happened inside when she’s awake.” Seeing that there were no signs of the hair-like worms drilling out of her body, Zhou Wen got Lu Yunxian to wrap Lu Ning in a rainproof cloth he had brought along. Lu Yunxian then piggybacked her out of the ruins.</p>
<p>When Zhao Xin and company saw Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian coming out unscathed and bringing someone back, they were quite surprised.</p>
<p>“Lu Ning! What happened to her?” Zhao Xin was shocked when he saw Lu Ning.</p>
<p>He knew Lu Ning’s might. Her ice-elemental Primordial Energy Art was considered top-notch at the Epic stage. With the help of many excellent-grade Companion Beasts, not many people could defeat her.</p>
<p>Now that Lu Ning had been brought back by Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian in a coma, it meant that the situation below wasn’t looking good.</p>
<p>“What happened? How’s Adjutant An and the rest?” Zhao Xin asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. When we arrived at the entrance of the underground tunnel, we happened to see her come out. We will have to wake her up before we can figure out what happened underground,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>“Let me try. I have an Ivy Companion Beast with good healing abilities.” As Zhao Xin spoke, he summoned a plant-type Companion Beast.</p>
<p>The green vine wrapped around Lu Ning’s body like a snake, its sprouts crawled across Ning’s face and reached into her nostrils, mouth, and ears, producing some liquid that resembled water.</p>
<p>The liquid had decent healing properties. Even a severely injured person would be able to temporarily awaken.</p>
<p>However, despite Zhao Xi making the green vines produce the liquid, he failed to wake Lu Ning.</p>
<p>“Strange… If she’s only injured, the Rejuvenation Juice would still be effective even if her brain has been injured. Why isn’t she reacting at all? Could she have been hypnotized?” Zhao Xin asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>The others did not have any treatment abilities. They looked at each other, but there was nothing they could come up with.</p>
<p>“Don’t let your Companion Beast waste its energy. Let it rest for a while. It might be needed later,” Zhou Wen said to Zhao Xin.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, do you have a solution?” Zhao Xin had changed his mind and called him Young Master Wen like Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try. It’s a last-ditch effort.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he flicked his wrist. A strange energy condensed in his hand, forming a metal syringe.</p>
<p>Walking to Lu Ning’s side, Zhou Wen’s eyes stared at Lu Ning like a floodlight. At the same time, he injected the syringe into Lu Ning’s arm.</p>
<p>When he was in school, he had learned about injections, but it was limited to the basics. Furthermore, it was only theory with no practicals. Zhou Wen was only trying to see if Doctor Darkness’s poison could kill the strange worms inside Lu Ning’s body.</p>
<h3 id='chapter284'>Chapter 284 Operation</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen pushed the syringe in very slowly because he didn’t know how much poison was needed to kill the worms. If the dosage was too high, he might poison Lu Ning to death. He couldn’t be too reckless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen had experienced the poison himself in-game, so he knew at what concentration it would be fatal. Although it was by his own standards, Lu Ning was at the Epic stage, so she likely could endure more than he could.</p>
<p>As the poison slowly entered Lu Ning’s body, Zhou Wen carefully observed her reaction to see if there was any change in the strange worms due to the poison.</p>
<p>If they struggled too hard, he feared that they might damage Lu Ning’s body. When that happened, Lu Ning’s body would be riddled with holes. Even if the worms were poisoned to death, it would be useless.</p>
<p>However, with how serious Lu Ning’s situation was, he could only take the risk and give it a try. If he didn’t get rid of the worms, she would die sooner or later anyway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the worst situation that worried everyone didn’t happen. After the poison was injected into Lu Ning, her body started to twitch violently, but it did not wake her up.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company looked at Lu Ning worriedly, but Zhou Wen continued to inject more of the poison without any expression. He carefully controlled the amount.</p>
<p>It looked like Lu Ning was in great pain, but it was the result of the poison acting up, not because of the strange worms.</p>
<p>The poison flowed through her bloodstream. It was excruciating, but very effective. After absorbing the poisoned blood or being corroded by the poison, the worms quickly stopped squirming.</p>
<p>Before long, all the worms in Lu Ning’s body had been killed, but it didn’t ease Zhou Wen’s furrowed brows. After the worms died, their corpses remained in Lu Ning’s body. This might lead to a blockage, causing problems.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t remove the hair-like worms, death was a certainty for Lu Ning. It was obvious that she had not fully recovered from her persistent coma.</p>
<p>But to extract such thin worms from so many tiny blood vessels, and with so many of them in her organs, even the best surgeon in the world wouldn’t be able to cut open her blood vessels and organs to extract the worms, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>As though sensing Zhou Wen’s thoughts, Doctor Darkness informed him with a strong thought, as though telling him that he could do it.</p>
<p>This left Zhou Wen somewhat astonished. Although every Companion Beast had their own will, most of them didn’t have much of a mind of their own. Up to now, Zhou Wen only had four Companion Beasts that could clearly express their thoughts:</p>
<p>Truth Listener, Banana Fairy, Ghost Bride, and Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness was born from the Dead Man Tree. It might be extraordinary. Zhou Wen was a little worried. If Doctor Darkness really gained complete sentience in the future, would he turn back into that crazy doctor?</p>
<p>He summoned Doctor Darkness and he walked to Lu Ning, his slender fingers holding a scalpel.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and company looked at Doctor Darkness who was holding the scalpel like a puppet. They knew that it was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, but they didn’t know why he had summoned one.</p>
<p>To have a Companion Beast operate on humans? This was not something they would have come up with even in their wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Indeed, many Companion Beasts possessed powerful healing abilities that could even revive those on the brink of death. However, they were manifestations of dimensional power, and surgery was a professional technique that was completely different from simple powers.</p>
<p>In the next second, Doctor Darkness completely overturned their understanding of Companion Beasts. The scalpel in Doctor Darkness’s hand flashed as it sliced through Lu Ning’s blood vessels. Then, with a syringe in hand, he injected the poison into her blood vessels. The entire process was so fluid that it was harrowing</p>
<p>If not for the fact that there were no medical equipment, they might even feel like they were watching the most outstanding doctor in an operation theater.</p>
<p>As the poison entered her body, Lu Ning’s body convulsed once more. Then, at the spots where the blood vessels had been cut open, blood slowly flowed out. The hair-like strange worms flowed out with them.</p>
<p>Zhao Xin and the rest were shocked when they saw the strange worms. They could not help but exclaim, “What the heck are those?”</p>
<p>After Doctor Darkness was done, he returned to Zhou Wen’s side. Zhou Wen was depressed as he thought, You are just leaving it like that? If she continues bleeding, she will die from excessive blood loss despite your removal of the strange worms.</p>
<p>“I want her alive,” Zhou Wen said to Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness didn’t have the ability to answer. All he did was send a thought to Zhou Wen, as though he was saying that he was only responsible for extracting the strange worms.</p>
<p>He’s still so toxic after becoming a Companion Beast. It’s no wonder he’s called Doctor Darkness. Zhou Wen had no choice but to say to Zhao Xin, “Use your Ivy to help Lu Ning. Don’t let her bleed out.”</p>
<p>When Zhao Xin heard this, he summoned the Ivy again, letting it secrete the Rejuvenation Juice to nourish Lu Ning’s injured body.</p>
<p>The Rejuvenation Juice was rather effective. When all the strange worms had finally flowed out of the wounds, Lu Ning didn’t die from excessive blood loss. Instead, she woke up.</p>
<p>“Alright, stop her bleeding.” Zhou Wen had used Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration to keep an eye on her the entire process. Seeing that all the strange worms had flowed out, he immediately got Zhao Xin and the rest to stop her bleeding.</p>
<p>The openings that Doctor Darkness had sliced were tiny. At first, it was the effects of the venom that caused the blood to flow out. When the effects of the poisons reduced, the blood would stop flowing once all the strange worms were purged. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel at Doctor Darkness’s control over the poison.</p>
<p>“Lu Ning, how do you feel? Can you speak?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw Lu Ning open her eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Ning’s eyes couldn’t focus in the beginning. It took her a while to recover. After identifying Zhou Wen and company, her face revealed a look of puzzlement as she struggled to sit up and asked hoarsely, “Why am I here?”</p>
<p>“It was Young Master Wen who rescued you. You aren’t aware, but you were unconscious when you were brought back. Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast showed its prowess and extracted the strange worms from your body…” Zhao Xin said as he looked at the strange, hair-like worms that coiled together on the ground. He couldn’t help but shiver.</p>
<p>The thought of so many worms entering a body made him shudder.</p>
<p>Lu Ning’s expression changed when she saw the strange worms. She seemed to finally regain complete consciousness and became angry. “Lord Alcohol and those b*stards didn’t come to help Adjutant An in a search and rescue operation. After we arrived at the underground battlefield, they suddenly revealed their true colors. They attacked us, sending us down a fault.”</p>
<h3 id='chapter285'>Chapter 285 Underground Tunnel</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were shocked when they heard that. Lu Yunxian hurriedly asked, “Lu Ning, make yourself clear. What happened?”</p>
<p>Lu Ning recounted everything that had happened. After following the marks left behind by Ouyang Lan, they found the entrance to the underground tunnel. Then, An Sheng led the rest in.</p>
<p>However, not long after they entered, the entrance to the passageway suddenly closed. A large amount of black liquid seeped out from the crevices in the rocks.</p>
<p>When they took a closer look, it wasn’t a liquid but worms that resembled strands of hair. The number of worms was immeasurable like a tidal wave. The moment the worms touched their bodies, they entered through their pores, quickly knocking them unconscious.</p>
<p>If one had too many worms in one’s body, it would be fatal.</p>
<p>The passageway couldn’t be opened, and they still needed to rescue Ouyang Lan. An Sheng could only order them to retreat deeper underground. After traveling for some time, they finally escaped the worm tide and found a strange underground temple.</p>
<p>Just as An Sheng gave the order to explore the temple, Lord Alcohol and the rest suddenly launched a sneak attack on An Sheng and Lu Ning. An Sheng was caught off guard and was thrown down the fault where the worm tide was everywhere. Although Lu Ning put up a resistance, she was outnumbered. She too was thrown down the fault.</p>
<p>Lu Ning only remembered that she had fallen into the worm tide and fainted. She thought she was dead for sure, so she never expected to see Zhou Wen and company when she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian frowned after hearing that. “Don’t you know that when you came out, you were in a strange vehicle?”</p>
<p>“What vehicle?” Lu Ning frowned.</p>
<p>With Lu Ning truly unaware of this, Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian were puzzled. From what Lu Ning said, it was naturally impossible for Lord Alcohol and the rest to be magnanimous and rescue her. There was something fishy about all of this.</p>
<p>“Lu Ning, can you draw a map for me of places you walked past and the things you encountered?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we were constantly on the run back then. I can remember the general direction, but not the path. I do remember some special landmarks.” Lu Ning took a pen and paper and wrote some fragmented information.</p>
<p>“Have a good rest. We’ll think of a way to rescue them.” Zhou Wen took the information and prepared to return to game. He planned on following Lu Ning’s route first.</p>
<p>Lu Ning shook her head and did not say anything. They only had a few people left, so how could they go in to rescue the rest? Furthermore, An Sheng had already fallen into the sea of worms. The chances of survival were slim.</p>

<p>Zhou Wen didn’t believe that a person like An Sheng would die so easily. Furthermore, the former principal was probably inside. He had to go in, no matter what.</p>
<p>After returning to his tent, Zhou Wen switched on the mysterious phone and entered the Zhuolu instance dungeon, arriving at the entrance to the underground tunnel.</p>
<p>The game didn’t have the strange vehicle. Zhou Wen looked at the information Lu Ning wrote and directly controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter the tunnel.</p>
<p>The tunnel was dark and damp, and the stone steps were covered with moss. On both sides of the tunnel were partially dug out artificial stone walls. He could tell that this was supposed to be an underground cave, but it was slightly widened.</p>
<p>Not long after he entered the passageway, he heard a loud bang. The passageway’s entrance was blocked by a stone door, and the passageway turned dark.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was somewhat unused to the darkness. Without Truth Listener’s ability, just his vision alone was insufficient. He couldn’t see anything in the darkness.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Zhou Wen still had Doctor Darkness to rely on. He activated Light of Penetration, and immediately Zhou Wen’s eyes shot out light beams, allowing him to see everything within ten meters.</p>
<p>This glance made Zhou Wen’s scalp tingle. He saw that there were many cracks on the stone walls. Countless strands of the strange hair-like worms were gushing out from the cracks, just as Lu Ning had described-they resembled black liquid.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the banana fan and fanned at the surrounding hair-like worms. Wherever the wind passed, the worms were immediately blown away. Slamming into the mountain wall, they turned to crushed ice and died.</p>
<p>‘Killed Legendary creature, Blood Threadworm… Killed Legendary creature, Blood Threadworm… Killed Legendary creature, Blood Threadworm…’ With one flap of the fan, the system’s notification flooded the screen.</p>
<p>They are only at the Legendary level? Zhou Wen was slightly disappointed. He didn’t expect such strange worms to only be at the Legendary stage. However, they were still very impressive for drilling into the body of an Epic expert and causing her to enter a coma.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, level suppression isn’t absolute. The power of these Blood Threadworms is rather special and with such copious numbers of them, it’s no wonder even Epic experts have to avoid them. When Zhou Wen saw that the Blood Threadworms were surging over at him like a tidal wave, he didn’t waste his Primordial Energy any further. He immediately ran deeper into the passageway.</p>
<p>Lu Ning slept for more than ten hours and used some Primordial Energy Crystals. When she woke up again, she looked much better.</p>
<p>When Lu Yunxian saw Lu Ning sit up, he suddenly asked her, “Lu Ning, would you dare to enter the underground tunnel again?”</p>
<p>“If Adjutant An is already dead, what’s the point of us entering again?” Lu Ning sighed. “Now that I think of it, we were desperately running for our lives after we entered the tunnel. I didn’t realize it back then, but on second thought, we were led by Lord Alcohol and the rest the entire time. They were familiar with the underground world from the very beginning. They aren’t here to save Madam Lan. They have hatched a plot.”</p>
<p>“No matter what motives they have, I don’t believe Adjutant An will die so easily. Furthermore, Young Master Wen will definitely go in to reinforce Adjutant An. But we don’t understand the situation inside too well. If it’s possible, I hope that you can follow us into the underground tunnel,” Lu Yunxian said. There were certain things that Zhou Wen didn’t need to do, but he needed to make plans.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen? Do you mean Zhou Wen? I know he has great potential, but he’s only at the Legendary stage. In such a terrifying place, even we can’t protect ourselves. What can he do?”</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian didn’t elaborate. He looked at Lu Ning and asked, “Then are you still willing to enter the underground tunnel again? Just think of it as doing it for Adjutant An.”</p>
<p>Lu Ning gaped and was about to say something when she suddenly heard a clunking sound coming from the ruins. It sounded like a bell, but it did not sound like it was a result of metal colliding. It was more like the sound of stones colliding</p>
<p>Zhou Wen also heard the noise and immediately connected it to the strange vehicle. Furthermore, from the direction of the sound, it seemed to be coming from the entrance to the underground tunnel.</p>
<h3 id='chapter286'>Chapter 286 The Strange Vehicle Sets Off</h3>
<p>When Zhou Wen came out, Lu Yunxian and company had already walked out of the tent and were looking in the direction of the ruins.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, should we go take a look?” Lu Yunxian asked Zhou Wen. Clearly, he had also determined that the noises came from the strange vehicle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen nodded. “It’d be good to take a look.”</p>
<p>He was very curious about the strange vehicle too. In the game, he didn’t see the vehicle, despite entering the tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was very curious as to where the strange vehicle had come from. Was it brought in by someone or something that was originally from the underground tunnel?</p>
<p>Seeing Lu Yunxian follow Zhou Wen into the ruins, Lu Ning, who hadn’t recuperated from her injuries, hesitated for a moment before following them.</p>
<p>“How did you resolve the spatial winds?” Lu Ning rode a huge Snow Fox behind them. She didn’t see Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian use any means to interfere with the spatial wind, so she couldn’t help feeling puzzled.</p>
<p>When she had entered with the others previously, they had sacrificed quite a number of Companion Beasts to find a way to interfere with the spatial wind. However, it was only a stopgap measure; the spatial winds still appeared.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen has already killed the dimensional creature that uses the spatial winds. There shouldn’t be any spatial winds anytime soon,” said Lu Yunxian.</p>
<p>Lu Ning found it unbelievable. She looked suspiciously at Zhou Wen, finding it hard to believe that this youth could do something so unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, the reality forced her to believe it. She didn’t encounter the spatial wind again despite having been inside the ruins for some time.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he walked forward silently. Soon, the three of them arrived in front of the underground tunnel.</p>
<p>As expected, the strange vehicle that emitted the sounds was parked in the tunnel. However, it suddenly started moving again when they approached. The wooden puppet standing in front of the vehicle started to move its arms, turning the crank. The strange vehicle began to creak, producing a loud clang with every revolution of the crank.</p>
<p>The wheels of the strange vehicle moved slowly, but this time, it didn’t move forward, but backward as though it was returning to the ruins.</p>
<p>“This is the strange vehicle you were talking about? Did I come out lying on it?” Lu Ning asked as she looked at the strange vehicle that was slowly retreating.</p>
<p>Read more chapter on vipnovel.com</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lu Yunxian said, “You came out on it. You were the only one.”</p>
<p>“What power is driving it?” Lu Ning looked at the puppet on the strange vehicle, as if she wanted to know if it were alive.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen and I had checked before. The vehicle is a dead object. There are no signs of living creatures on the puppet, but we didn’t discover any fuel or similar items. We have no idea what principle is behind the driving force. We originally imagined that it had expended its energy source, but from the looks of it, that isn’t the case,” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>Seeing that the strange vehicle was slowly retreating and about to enter the underground tunnel, Zhou Wen looked at Lu Ning and asked, “Lu Ning, you were brought out by the vehicle while unconscious. Then, could you have fallen into the strange vehicle?”</p>
<p>“I really don’t know. I was struck off the fault by Lord Alcohol and the rest and fell into the tide of Blood Threadworms. I lost consciousness very quickly. I really don’t know what happened next.” Lu Ning shook her head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the strange vehicle that was about to retreat into the tunnel with a frown.</p>
<p>In the game, he had already entered deep underground with the information given by Lu Ning. However, Lu Ning’s information only had a few landmarks and didn’t come with detailed directions or path identifiers. Hence, Zhou Wen had no choice but to find a path himself.</p>
<p>However, the underground world was massive. He had spent more than ten hours in it without finding the temple that Lu Ning mentioned.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t have the opinion that Lu Ning was lying to him because the roads inside were complicated, as though they had been changed artificially. He walked for a long time and realized that there were many instances when he would circle back to a spot he had passed previously. This spot wasn’t fixed, but despite walking for more than ten hours in-game, Zhou Wen still failed to walk past it.</p>
<p>“I remember you mentioning that you fell to a fault layer underground. That was inside the temple, right?” Zhou Wen asked Lu Ning.</p>
<p>“That’s right. As soon as we entered the temple, we were ambushed by Lord Alcohol and the others, and we were struck down the fault layer,” Lu Ning said.</p>
<p>“If I were to deduce that you fell into this strange vehicle and triggered some mechanism, allowing it to take you out, then if we were to ride this vehicle, would it take us back to the fault layer where you dropped?”</p>
<p>“I really don’t know, but it’s too dangerous,” Lu Ning smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s too dangerous.” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“Although it’s very dangerous, this might be the best solution. Lu Ning also said that she was led by Lord Alcohol and the rest. Since they know the path and we don’t, we might not be able to find the temple if we just head down. Lu Ning came out on this strange vehicle, and since she was able to come out safely, it implies that the strange vehicle’s interior is safe. Our only way of going straight to the temple is by taking the strange vehicle in,” Zhou Wen said.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another sentence that Zhou Wen didn’t say. He had played the game for more than ten hours and was quite familiar with the underground world. He had a way to deal with the few dimensional creatures inside. What was most troublesome was that he couldn’t get out of the maze-like area. The strange vehicle in front of them seemed to be the only hope.</p>
<p>“But that’s just speculation. What if the strange vehicle takes us to a more dangerous place?” Lu Yunxian said.</p>
<p>“We know nothing about the interior, so everything inside is dangerous for us.” Zhou Wen saw that half of the vehicle had entered the tunnel and didn’t hesitate anymore. He walked over briskly and jumped into the carriage and said to Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning, “Head back to the camp and wait for me. I’ll head on to take a look.”</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen could continue waiting and find a way out in the game, he didn’t know how long that would take. Perhaps a day or two, maybe a week or so, or even a month or two. He was afraid the former principal couldn’t afford to wait for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that he would be trapped inside. With his understanding of the underground world, he knew that there were a few relatively safe spots inside. Furthermore, his chaos space also had plenty of daily necessities. He wouldn’t be in danger even if he was trapped for a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had his phone. After entering the tunnel, he could have the blood-colored avatar follow the path. If any accidents were to happen, he could find a safe place to continue exploring in game.</p>
<h3 id='chapter287'>Chapter 287 Underground Starry Sky</h3>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I’ll go with you.” Lu Yunxian rushed over and jumped onto the vehicle.</p>
<p>Lu Ning was still hesitating, but when she saw that the strange vehicle had already tilted and was about to slide into the underground tunnel, she gritted her teeth and let the Snow Fox rush her to the strange vehicle.</p>
<p>Lu Ning jumped onto the strange vehicle just as it slid down.</p>
<p>Cha-chuff… Cha-chuff… Cha-chuff…</p>
<p>The strange vehicle entered the tunnel, and like a roller coaster, it suddenly sped up and dived deeper underground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company hurriedly grabbed the edge of the carriage and saw the scenery behind them rapidly retreating. The strange vehicle charged forward as though it was charging through the criss-crossing caves, but it seemed to have a fixed trajectory.</p>
<p>The puppet moved its arms, pushing the crank wildly; its body moving up and down like a sewing machine at full speed.</p>
<p>“Hold tight. Don’t get thrown out.” The strange vehicle was too fast, and it didn’t slow down when it made turns. Zhou Wen and company nearly flew out due to the shift in their center of gravity.</p>
<p>The three of them grabbed onto the edge of the carriage as their bodies floated up. They waited for the bend to pass before slamming into the back of the carriage. Before they could heave a sigh of relief, the next bend was up.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian were fine, but Lu Ning had yet to recover. These jolts made her expression change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lu Ning was not a pampered child. She had traveled across the League as a mercenary hunter, hunting countless dimensional creatures. She had experienced many battles and had encountered situations many times more difficult than she was in now. This wasn’t enough to throw her into a panic.</p>
<p>After a while, the slope of the cave slowed down and the speed of the strange vehicle slowed down.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company could finally sit safely in the carriage without being flung around.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian held onto the edge of the carriage and stood up. He looked outside and saw stone walls and tunnels. Looking around, he soon realized that he couldn’t even tell which direction they were facing.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I don’t even know where I’m heading to now.” Lu Yunxian looked at Zhou Wen helplessly.</p>
<p>“Lu Ning, look around. Do you remember this place?” Zhou Wen asked Lu Ning.</p>
<p>He knew the direction and had even memorized the route of the strange vehicle. His focus allowed him to remember everything even under harsh conditions. This was not something the average person could do.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t say this out loud. Instead, he asked Lu Ning.</p>
<p>Lu Ning’s face was pale. She stood up, with the help of the carriage’s sides, and looked around. After a while, she said, “There are no obvious landmarks here. It’s the same as the average cave. I don’t know if I’ve been here before.”</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhou Wen agreed. There weren’t any special characteristics here other than stone walls and forks everywhere. Furthermore, with their poor eyesight, they only had a visibility of less than twenty meters from the illumination of the stone lamp at the front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, their eyes lit up. They saw a starry sky appear in the darkness in front of them. In the pitch-black night sky, countless stars shimmered.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company quickly discovered that it wasn’t the night sky but a type of ore on the dark stone walls. It was similar to mica which gave off fascinating lights.</p>
<p>The vehicle traveled in the dark cave, and with the scattered ores looking like stars, it felt like they were flying in the starry sky. It was so beautiful that it made one’s soul feel liberated.</p>
<p>“Not good. When we came here, we passed similar places. Beside those strange light-emitting ores are strange Epic creatures. They resemble bats but do not have sonar skills. Their eyes will shoot out light beams. Once contact is made, the body will melt like snow. It’s extremely terrifying,” Lu Ning said.</p>
<p>“How many did you meet earlier?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the top of the stone tunnel.</p>
<p>“We met three in total, but we didn’t encounter them together. Otherwise, there might have been casualties,” Lu Ning said.</p>
<p>“Then you might want to be mentally prepared now,” Zhou Wen said with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Lu Ning and Lu Yunxian couldn’t see clearly, but Zhou Wen could see using Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration. There were white bat-shaped dimensional creatures hanging from the ceiling. He had no idea how many there were since he couldn’t count them all.</p>
<p>Just as Lu Ning was about to ask him what he meant, she heard the flapping of her wings. A large swath of white bats swooped down from the ceiling like a thick layer of white cloud. Countless bats had flown over.</p>
<p>When Lu Ning saw this, the last of the color in her face drained. Just the number of bats flying over numbered at least a hundred. And this was limited to what she could see. She had no idea how many more she couldn’t see in the darkness.</p>
<p>When they first came, they had taken quite a lot of effort to kill a white bat. Now, to have so many bats charging at them, it could be said that they had just been passed the death sentence.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Zhou Wen prepared for combat. Lu Yunxian didn’t know how powerful the white bats were, but Zhou Wen did. However, he wasn’t afraid. He had already seen these white bats in-game.</p>
<p>The light beams produced by the white bats’ eyes were indeed powerful, but Zhou Wen had his ways of dealing with them.</p>
<p>Seeing large swaths of bats fly over, Zhou Wen held the banana fan and waved it at the bats. An invisible Grand Yin Wind gushed out, sending the white bats flying.</p>
<p>Lu Ning summoned the Snow Fox and was about to fight to the death when she saw Zhou Wen standing in front of the vehicle, holding an extremely beautiful fan in his hand. He gently fanned the white cloud-like bats.</p>
<p>The white bats suddenly seemed to be swept away by an invisible force. They flew out and slammed into the stone ceiling, their bodies shattering from the impact. One by one, they smashed loudly into the surrounding stone walls and stone steps around them.</p>
<p>Lu Ning looked at Zhou Wen in a daze, unable to believe her eyes. The might of the fan had actually killed nearly a hundred white bats. It was truly astounding. She found it unbelievable that it was the work of a Legendary student like Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>She could accept it if that had been done by a top-notch Epic expert. Yet, Zhou Wen, a Legendary, was able to produce such might. She found it surreal.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. The banana fan was a top-notch Epic and the white bats also had their weaknesses. They were extremely fast and most Epic experts would find it difficult to injure them. Together with their terrifying eye beam skills, they were indeed tough to deal with.</p>
<p>However, the white bat’s weakness was that its Constitution was too low. It was the weakest among Epic creatures with about 20 points. It was not much stronger than a Legendary. It couldn’t withstand the Grand Yin Wind and could not avoid its huge area-of-effect attack. It could be said that the banana fan was its nemesis.</p>
<h3 id='chapter288'>Chapter 288 Strange Vehicle Adventure</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen watched as large numbers of white bats landed in the tunnel in fragments behind him. There were also some crystals, and he couldn’t help but feel wistful.</p>
<p>The strange vehicle continued to move forward. He didn’t know what the consequences would be if he left it, so he didn’t attempt to pick up the crystals. He could only watch as the strange vehicle left the spoils untouched.</p>
<p>Despite him killing a large group of bats, there were still large numbers that didn’t fear death as they charged forward. Looking at the white shadows flying above them, it made one’s scalp tingle.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had just used the Grand Yin Wind and his Yuan Qi hadn’t recovered when he saw large swaths of white bats rush down. His expression changed slightly as he clenched his Bamboo Blade and prepared to engage the white bats in melee combat.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning summoned their Companion Beasts to prepare for battle. The carriage was too small, so they could only summon Companion Beasts in their companion form-as armor or weapons-to aid them in battle.</p>
<p>When a large horde of white bats charged down, Zhou Wen was just about to draw his saber when there was a humming sound. All the white bats above retreated. None of them continued charging as they circled the ceiling of the cave.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company were stunned as they looked ahead. They didn’t know when the puppet began holding a strange musical instrument. It was likely made of stone; flat with a few holes on it. It was rather crudely made.</p>
<p>However, just as the white bat was about to charge down, the puppet placed the stone musical instrument in front of its face. Its face was a wooden board without any facial features. It was unknown how it blew, but it produced a humming sound.</p>
<p>The moment the sound emitted, the white bats immediately retreated again. They hovered above them, but none had the courage to swoop down again.</p>
<p>The strange vehicle moved through the bats, but they didn’t encounter any more attacks from them. They safely moved forward.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen… Don’t tell me that the puppet is alive…?” Lu Yunxian looked at the puppet with his mouth agape. He thought it was a mechanical object. Who knew that there would be such a development?</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at the puppet as well. The puppet stood in front, no longer moving its arm. However, the strange vehicle continued to move forward at a constant speed. The crank was also spinning autonomously.</p>
<p>The puppet stood there, holding the stone musical instrument as it looked forward into the distance. However, without any facial features and eyes, what was it using? It was extremely bizarre.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen found it odd, but since it was beneficial to them, he didn’t have any intention of attacking the puppet. He was just worried about where the strange carriage would take them.</p>
<p>The scenery in front of them suddenly broadened as the white bats that filled the sky scattered. Zhou Wen and company looked past the scattered white bats and saw a blue sky.</p>
<p>Unlike the cave from before, this place was actually a huge and boundless space. It was impossible to see the end of this space at a glance. In the distance, one could even see the sea and islands. Above them was a blue sky.</p>
<p>However, the blue sky was a little too blue. It was like a sapphire. Zhou Wen looked carefully and realized that it really was a sapphire.</p>
<p>A gigantic sapphire formed the sky of the underground space by occupying the entire area above.</p>
<p>There were no suns or stars. The sapphire emitted a faint blue light that illuminated the entire underground space. At the same time, everything in the underground space had a blue hue.</p>
<p>In the next second, the strange vehicle landed on the blue ocean. Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was an ocean, but he just couldn’t see the water body’s end. All he saw was deep blue seawater.</p>
<p>The strange vehicle cruised over the sea surface. Its stone wheels were rolling across the surface as though it was traveling on flat ground. They dragged out two white waves on the surface of the sea in its wake.</p>
<p>“What’s that underneath?” Lu Yunxian pointed at the seawater beside him in horror.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Ning looked at the surface of the sea and saw a huge shadow, as though a behemoth was swimming under the strange vehicle.</p>
<p>All they could see was a gigantic shadow, nothing else. Furthermore, the shadow was gradually expanding.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>The seawater erupted like a volcanic eruption as it sprayed hundreds of feet into the sky. Huge waves formed as the seawater struck the strange vehicle. However, the strange vehicle appeared imperturbable. This didn’t stop the seawater from pouring into the carriage, drenching them.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen and company weren’t in the mood to care about the seawater. The three of them widened their eyes as they stared at the sea by the side of the war wagon.</p>
<p>A huge creature that looked like it was carved from obsidian extended half its body from the sea. Its body was perfect and gorgeous. Its black obsidian-like scales shimmered and every inch of its body seemed to be exquisitely carved. Even if one were to observe the titanic body with a magnifying glass, one wouldn’t be able to find any crudeness or flaws.</p>
<p>The huge body that was like a hill exuded an exquisite and majestic feeling.</p>
<p>“Dragon… That’s a dragon… a dragon carved from obsidian…” Lu Yunxian stammered as he pointed at the creature that had stretched half its body out of the sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t look too good either. The development seemed to exceed his expectations. Regardless of whether the terrifying creature in the sea was a dragon or not, he could tell from its aura that it was a terrifying existence. It might even be stronger than the white dragon in Dragon’s Well.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A series of crashing waves sounded as the seawater around the strange vehicle churned. Copious amounts of seawater surged over, knocking Zhou Wen and company off their feet.</p>
<p>However, their gazes were never on the strange vehicle’s interior, but outside. Black dragon heads emerged one after another. One… Two… Three…</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen saw the ninth black dragon extend its head out of the sea, he felt numb.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The nine creatures carved from obsidian roared at the strange vehicle, sending sonar waves at them. Even the seawater turned into tumultuous waves as a result of the sonar waves. They surged at the puny strange vehicle from every direction.</p>
<p>“We’re doomed!” Lu Yunxian’s expression changed drastically. Such terrifying creatures and such terrifying sound waves implied that they had no way of escaping the calamity.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen held the banana fan tightly as he prepared for death. Even though he knew he wasn’t a match for these entities, he couldn’t just sit back and do nothing.</p>
<p>“Hum!” The strange sound from the stone musical instrument echoed in front of the carriage. The sound wave dispersed the churning sonar waves and tsunamis at the same time, preventing them from getting close to the strange vehicle.</p>
<p>The nine black dragons stared at the strange vehicle covetously, but none of them lunged forward. They only watched as the strange vehicle slowly drove towards the other side of the sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company’s hearts raced. After the strange vehicle left the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen looked back and saw the nine obsidian-like dragons roaring at the sky as though they were venting their anger.</p>
<p>And beneath the sea, Zhou Wen discovered that the lower half of their bodies were connected, like a black mountain that had sunken into the sea. Only then did he realize that it wasn’t nine dragons, but a monster with nine heads.</p>
<h3 id='chapter289'>Chapter 289 Returning to the Bat Cave</h3>
<p>The strange vehicle raced across the sea while the puppet remained in front, staring into the distance, motionless like a statue.</p>
<p>“Is this how I came back?” Lu Ning asked. Her face looked puzzled. She couldn’t imagine what she had experienced while she was unconscious.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen leaned against the back of the strange vehicle, playing games on his phone.</p>
<p>He wanted to see if he could control the blood-colored avatar to take the same path.</p>
<p>Although he knew that it was useless even if the blood-colored avatar walked over, successfully passing the cave of white bats, it was impossible for him to cross the underground sea with the nine-headed dragon guarding it.</p>
<p>However, there wasn’t much to do in the strange vehicle. Lu Ning was resting while Lu Yunxian was observing the situation ahead. Since he had nothing else to do, Zhou Wen began grinding the instance dungeon.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sat at the back, and there was only the sea behind him. In front, Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning couldn’t see what he was playing.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to move forward at full speed. Soon, large groups of Blood Threadworms surrounded him. Zhou Wen didn’t have the patience to deal with them. He ignored them and ran at full speed. When his Primordial Energy filled up, he killed all of them, letting them rain crystals. However, he no longer had any use for Legendary crystals.</p>
<p>As for the Blood Threadworm eggs that dropped, Zhou Wen would pick them up and incubate them.</p>
<p>The Blood Threadworms were not strong, but if there were a lot of them, things were different. Even Epic stage experts had to avoid them.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had hatched quite a number of Blood Threadworms. He planned on trying to see if they were of any use. If they were useful, he would keep them and not feed them to his pets.</p>
<p>Where can I find a speed-type mount? I run with my legs all the time and it expends my Primordial Energy, but I can’t do anything about it. Zhou Wen used his Primordial Energy to increase his speed and ran for a while before having to recover his Primordial Energy. This was quite tiring, so he thought of how he needed a mount.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally had something extraordinary about him, being called a genius among geniuses by the former principal. His divergent thinking abilities and memory far exceeded that of ordinary people. He remembered the complicated routes that the strange vehicle took, despite its fast speed and quickly arrived at the cave of white bats.</p>
<p>Looking at the ores that looked like stars in the cave, Zhou Wen suddenly wondered if he could dig out these ores in-game.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, he gave it a try. It was not difficult to dig the ores. The blood-colored avatar shattered the rocks beside the ore, digging out a translucent milky-white crystal.</p>
<p>‘Obtained Primordial Crystal. Weight: 21 grams, Primordial Crystal Purity: 0.12’</p>
<p>This crystal is actually something that the game acknowledges. But what’s the use of Primordial Crystals? It can’t be used to make weapons that can kill dimensional creatures like Primordial Gold, right? Zhou Wen was astonished.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no storage space in-game. Even if he knew that the Primordial Crystals were useful, he couldn’t take them away.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any storage-type Companion Beasts. If they exist, I have to get one. Otherwise, it’s such a pity to waste so much good stuff. Zhou Wen had heard of such a Companion Beast, but he had never seen it. He also had no idea where they dropped.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t wait for the white bats to attack after entering the bat cave. He attracted the attention of the nearby white bats over.</p>
<p>There wasn’t any strange vehicle in the game, so if he were to be surrounded by the bats, he would definitely die. Therefore, Zhou Wen planned on killing them along the way and let them drop their items.</p>
<p>If he was lucky, he might even have a white bat drop as a mount. They flew at extremely fast speeds and were rare flying pets. Zhou Wen was very interested in getting one.</p>
<p>The only worry was he couldn’t hatch an Epic Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured a horde of white bats and with the fan, he sent them flying. Their bodies turned into ice sculptures in midair, shattering upon collision with the stone walls.</p>
<p>Seeing dozens of white bats being destroyed by a single attack and having plenty of crystals drop excited Zhou Wen greatly.</p>
<p>It would be great if all Epic creatures can be killed as easily as these white bats, Zhou Wen thought greedily.</p>
<p>It was a pity that it was not easy to find such weak Epic creatures. Furthermore, there were few places with Epic creatures appearing in huge hordes. In some smaller dimensional zones, Epic creatures usually appeared alone. Even in a super dungeon, like Zhuolu, it was rare to encounter one.</p>
<p>After scanning the battlefield, he discovered that the crystals produced by the white bat were mostly Speed Crystals. Epic crystals were very useful, but Zhou Wen’s absorbing was useless, nor could he take them away. He felt as if he had lost a winning lottery ticket as he looked at the floor of crystals.</p>
<p>A storage Companion Beast. I must get a storage Companion Beast, Zhou Wen screamed inwardly.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen lured and killed countless white bats along the way. Although he didn’t keep a careful count, he estimated he killed at least 400-500 of them. The crystals that dropped were all basic stat crystals.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Upon hearing a rather unique chime, Zhou Wen looked at the pile of white bat corpses and his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Among a few crystals, there was a crystal that glowed blue. The words on it were different from the rest.</p>
<p>Poison: 13… Overjoyed, Zhou Wen he hurriedly got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Poison Crystal. After absorbing it, his Poison stat reached 13 points.</p>
<p>A Poison stat allowed Zhou Wen to have a decent poison resistance. Furthermore, some special Epic Primordial Energy Skills had special requirements towards his stats.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought that if he could obtain a Primordial Energy Skill that came with the Poison element in the future, the Poison stat would definitely be useful.</p>
<p>Seeing that the white bats dropped Poison Crystals, Zhou Wen felt energized and continued charging forward. He kept luring and culling large numbers of them.</p>
<p>When he was less than halfway through the bat cave, Zhou Wen lured a large group of white bats and fanned them, sending them all to their deaths.</p>
<p>However, one of the bats flickered and vanished as though it had teleported. When it appeared again, it had passed the Grand Yin Wind and appeared in front of the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the white bat was different from the others. It was bigger and its color was different from the whiteness of the normal white bats. It looked as though it was carved from milk-white jade, and its eyes were like two shining diamonds.</p>
<p>In the next second, a beam shot out from the white jade-like bat’s eyes and headed straight for the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly used Ghost Steps to dodge its attack and began engaging in combat with it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter290'>Chapter 290 White Shadow of Poison</h3>
<p>The white bats’ speed was already surprisingly fast, but the jade-white bat was ludicrously fast. It wasn’t inferior to the Ghost King. Furthermore, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t just purely a difference in speed because it could now use the skill to pass through Great Yin Wind without suffering any damage.</p>
<p>Could this jade-white bat really be capable of spatial teleportation? Or is it the legendary instantaneous transmission? Zhou Wen was astonished as he constantly controlled the blood-colored avatar to circle around the jade-white bat.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness and Ghost Bride helped by the side, but the jade-white bat was too fast. They were unable to injure it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. He saw the jade-white bat phase into existence on a spot before him. After deducing its location, he suddenly raised his palm and chopped down the Demonic Astral Wheel.</p>
<p>The sanguine wheel of light spun furiously as it slashed at the jade-white bat.</p>
<p>The jade-white bat flapped its wings and easily dodged the Demonic Astral Wheel. However, when it continued charging at Zhou Wen, it grunted.</p>
<p>The Demonic Astral Wheel boomeranged back and landed on the jade-white bat’s back at an even faster speed.</p>
<p>CV</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy wasn’t enough to severely injure an Epic creature, but the jade-white bat was the type of Epic creature with high Speed but weak Constitution.</p>
<p>With the Demonic Astral Wheel hitting its back, the spinning blade beams immediately left a long gash on its back as blood splattered.</p>
<p>This attack caught the jade-white bat by surprise. Its body deviated from its trajectory and lost control for a moment.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness stabbed out with the scalpel in his hand. The scalpel in the Life Soul’s hand almost overlapped with his scalpel, stabbing into the bat’s chest, staggering it in midair.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate and made Banana Fairy take her true form. She puffed up her cheeks, turning her face chubby. Then, she blew at the jade-white bat.</p>
<p>The jade-white bat was frozen in place by the scalpel and couldn’t move. It was sent flying by the Great Yin Wind. Its body rapidly turned into an ice sculpture in the air before smashing into the wall and shattering to pieces.</p>
<p>Ding! Zhou Wen heard another special chime of something dropping. He hurriedly looked over and saw a milky-white egg drop on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was instantly overjoyed. I’m really lucky today. I’m getting whatever I’ve been wishing for.</p>
<p>However, on second thought, Zhou Wen felt a little nervous. He didn’t know if he could hatch a complete Epic Companion Egg.</p>
<p>Regardless, Zhou Wen first got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Companion Egg and checked its attributes.</p>
<p>White Shadow of Poison: Epic</p>
<p>Life Providence: Bone Corroding</p>
<p>Life Soul: Shadow of Darkness</p>
<p>Strength: 27</p>
<p>Speed: 40</p>
<p>Constitution: 24</p>
<p>Primordial Energy: 32</p>
<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Flash, Poison Ray, Claw of Poison</p>
<p>Companion Form: Arm Wings</p>
<p>After seeing the White Shadow of Poison’s attributes, Zhou Wen finally understood why this fellow was able to pass through the Grand Yin Wind. It didn’t teleport, but its Shadow of Darkness Life Soul could temporarily let it take on a shadow form.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the wind was, it was impossible for it to blow away the shadow. The White Shadow of Poison in an incorporeal shadow form was nearly invulnerable.</p>
<p>However, White Shadow of Poison could only enter a shadow state for a short period of time. Coupled with the speed-boosting Flash skill, it appeared as if it had completed teleportation.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gained a rough idea of its three skills, but White Shadow of Poison’s Companion Form left him somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Flying-type Companion Beasts were mostly winged Companion Beasts, and most of them had wings as their companion form. However, this was the first time Zhou Wen had heard of arm wings.</p>
<p>Looking at the White Shadow of Poison’s information, especially the information on the companion form, he saw a pair of white bat wings appear on the phone screen.</p>
<p>However, unlike ordinary wings, the upper part of the wings was not an ordinary skeleton frame, but a bat’s claws.</p>
<p>The arm wings could be considered wings and could also be considered a pair of arms. It was indeed very strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully looked at the White Shadow of Poison’s wings and discovered that they were indeed very ordinary, but extremely useful. They could be used as wings, allowing it to fly faster, and it could also be used as a pair of arms that were rather agile. When in combat, they could launch an attack that caught the enemy by surprise.</p>
<p>Good stuff. I just don’t know if it can be fully hatched. Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to use such a high-leveled Companion Egg as food. He gritted his teeth and prepared to hatch it.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t incubate it blindly. He first held onto the Companion Egg to grind a few white bats and picked up a few Primordial Energy Crystals. Placing them beside the blood-colored avatar, he made the blood-colored avatar sit on some and held two Primordial Energy Crystals in hand. Only then did he choose to hatch the egg.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhou Wen felt his Primordial Energy drain out of his body. He couldn’t even replenish his Primordial Energy with Dao Body. At this moment, the two Primordial Energy Crystals in the blood-colored avatar’s hands showed their effects. They kept injecting the blood-colored avatar with Primordial Energy. Likewise with the Primordial Energy Crystals under him. However, they were not absorbed as quickly as the Primordial Energy Crystals in his hand.</p>
<p>Although he had the dual replenishment stemming from his Dao Body and Primordial Energy Crystals, hatching a Companion Egg required too much Primordial Energy in a short period of time. The expenditure couldn’t keep up with the supply provided, making Zhou Wen feel physically drained.</p>
<p>After enduring for more than twenty seconds, just as Zhou Wen thought the blood-colored avatar was about to explode, the Companion Egg finally turned into a white beam and fused into the blood-colored avatar.</p>
<p>At the same time, a white bat tattoo appeared on Zhou Wen’s back. Clearly, the incubation had been successful.</p>
<p>I succeeded! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly looked at the White Shadow of Poison’s attributes. They were still the same. It remained at the Epic stage and didn’t drop in level. Its attributes were exactly the same as before.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen anxiously summoned the White Shadow of Poison before riding on its back and rode it deeper into the bat cave. Indeed, he was traveling much faster this way.</p>
<p>With the help of the White Shadow of Poison, Zhou Wen’s grinding speed increased. Along the way, he had another Poison Crystal and a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal drop.</p>
<p>The Poison Crystal only had 9 points, so it was useless for Zhou Wen with his 13 Poison stat. However, Zhou Wen loved the Flash Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. He absorbed it immediately, learning Flash at the Rank 6. It was a wing-required flying skill that greatly augmented his flight speed.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had the White Shadow of Poison, so he used it with great skill and verve.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t in a rush to scout ahead, Zhou Wen would have spent a few months here grinding and having more good stuff drop.</p>
<p>After passing the bat cave, Zhou Wen finally saw the endless underground sea. He couldn’t help but look deep into the sea, searching for signs of the nine-headed dragon.</p>
<h3 id='chapter291'>Chapter 291 Totem?</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned the White Shadow of Poison, getting it to fly higher and cling towards the sapphire sky. He hoped to avoid the nine-headed dragon and successfully pass through the underground sea.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen kept staring at the surface of the sea but didn’t discover the terrifying shadow. Suddenly, a blue light flashed on the screen and the screen turned black. The blood-colored avatar died mysteriously.</p>
<p>What was that? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at his phone. He only knew that the item wasn’t from the nine-headed dragon but from the sapphire sky.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we came on the strange vehicle. Otherwise, crossing the underground sea would have been extremely difficult. Just as Zhou Wen was about to restart the game, he heard Lu Yunxian, who was in charge of observing upfront, shout, “Land ahoy!”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Ning stood up and saw that in the direction the strange vehicle was heading, a silver beach had indeed appeared. The sand there was whiter than any sand that Zhou Wen had seen before, like snow.</p>
<p>The strange vehicle touched shore and the wheels left two deep tracks on the beach as it continued forward.</p>
<p>As soon as they crossed the sea, a white desert appeared in front of him. It was as white as snow.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the strange vehicle would continue on for a little while-at least an hour or two-just like how it was in the underground sea.</p>
<p>However, just as Zhou Wen sat down and was about to take out his phone to continue challenging the instance dungeons, he heard Lu Yunxian’s voice. “Young Master Wen, what do you think is that?”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen, who hadn’t even gotten comfortable, had no choice but to get up again. He looked deep into the desert and saw a flag-like object sticking out from the sand in the distance.</p>
<p>The reason it only looked like a flag was that the flag shaft was bent. It looked like a snake that had not lifted its body up straight. There was a piece of animal hide hanging on the top, black and tattered. Its shape resembled enlarged pants, ones that hadn’t been washed for centuries.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze and vaguely saw a symbol on the thing that looked like a pair of pants. However, without Truth Listener, his vision was clearly inferior to Lu Yunxian’s and Lu Ning’s.</p>
<p>Lu Ning’s expression changed slightly as she said in a strange voice, “I think I’ve seen the symbol on the flag before when Lord Alcohol took me into that stone temple.”</p>
<p>“What kind of symbol is it? Are you sure it’s the same?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>Lu Ning looked at it for a while longer, and when the vehicle got closer, she said, “There’s no mistake about that. It’s that symbol. It’s a triangular anchor. There’s also a long-haired woman’s side profile drawn on it. As the symbol looks very weird, I took a few more glances back then. It left quite a deep impression on me.”</p>
<p>A ship anchor with a woman’s side profile? Alarmed, Zhou Wen never expected to see it in such a place, having seen them before.</p>
<p>“Yes, although I don’t know who invented ship anchors or who the inventor is, according to history, it can’t have appeared recently. There must be large ships built before an anchor is needed. In Zhuolu myth, there are no stories with huge shops. So to have an anchor appear there naturally left a deep impression on me,” Lu Ning added.</p>
<p>“Could it have been carved after someone went in?” Lu Yunxian pondered.</p>
<p>“I had such thoughts too, but the pattern was specially engraved on a stone monument. Furthermore, the stone looked like it has been ravaged by thousands of years of history. It was rather indiscernible, so I doubt it was newly carved onto it. On second thought, it hasn’t been a century since the dimensional storms happened. The Zhuolu battlefield only appeared in recent years, so who could have entered the stone monument so early? Besides, it has to share the same architectural style as the stone temple. Even the materials and dating have to be uniform. That’s quite impossible,” Lu Ning said.</p>
<p>“It’s really quite impossible.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly, but his eyes remained fixed on the fluttering ragged pants. At that moment, he could tell that it was a piece of very tattered animal skin, but the anchor symbol was rather complete. Other than the difference in size, the anchor and the woman with the side profile were identical.</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this woman anchor symbol? If this pattern existed in ancient times, then who’s its owner? The woman on the anchor? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly, but he had no answers.</p>
<p>The bent flag shaft was not a snake but a black ancient vine that looked curled.</p>
<p>“What’s that under the flag?” Lu Yunxian said while staring at the bottom of the vine flag.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen could only see a blob of grayish-black shadows, as though it was someone sitting there with a cloak draped over him.</p>
<p>When the strange vehicle got closer to the flag, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t a cloak. It was just a strange robe made of animal hide. It looked like a cloak due to the covering of the head.</p>
<p>As for the creature in the beast-hide robes, it was unknown what it was. All that was left were bones. The bones were crystalline and had a clear and flawless look. It formed a stark contrast to the crude hide.</p>
<p>Creak!</p>
<p>When they were less than ten meters away from the flag, the strange vehicle screeched to a halt. The puppet turned around and turned its face at the skeleton in the animal hide. It bent its back slightly as if it was giving a bow.</p>
<p>Why did it stop just like that? Zhou Wen looked around in puzzlement. There was a white desert around him. He didn’t see any stone temple, nor was there a fault cliff or Blood Threadworms. It didn’t look like the place Lu Ning had mentioned.</p>
<p>Lu Ning was also confused. The three of them waited for a while. When they realized that the vehicle had no intention of continuing and the puppet had stopped moving, they jumped out from the back of the vehicle. They approached the skeleton and looked at it and the vine flag.</p>
<p>There were no words on the ragged vine flag. The only thing there was the anchor symbol. There was nothing special about it.</p>
<p>“This is the Zhuolu battlefield. Do you think this vine flag is the flag of a particular race during the war?” Lu Yunxian asked.</p>
<p>Lu Ning shook her head slightly. “Although there are many different versions of the myth, some say that the Yellow Emperor race’s totem is that of a bear or dragon. The Chiyou race was said to be insects, bulls, or birds. Regardless of the version of the myth you subscribe to, their totems shared something in common. They were basically living beings, nothing dead, much less an anchor.”</p>
<p>“What you said makes sense. At that time, it should have been a period of nature worship. There shouldn’t be any artificial totems like anchors.” Lu Yunxian found his thoughts ridiculous.</p>
<p>As they were studying the area, the skeleton, that was motionless like an inanimate object, suddenly stood up. It gave the three of them a fright as they quickly retreated to summon their Companion Beasts and warily stared at it.</p>
<h3 id='chapter292'>Chapter 292 Don’t Speak</h3>
<p>“Are you willing to become my race’s representative? My race will bestow you with supreme brilliance, an eternal brilliance, turning you into an immortal existence.” The skeleton held the vine flag in one hand and stood above the white sand. Although it was only a skeleton, its supercilious stance left one reeling. It was as though it had millions of formidable soldiers under its command, all capable of flattening the world once the order was given.</p>
<p>Two white flames burned in the skeleton’s eye sockets, resembling eyes as they stared straight at Zhou Wen, who was standing between Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning.</p>
<p>Once the skeleton spoke, Zhou Wen felt a sense of disgust and contempt rise up from his body. It was none other than the Sigh of the King</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning looked at Zhou Wen and the skeleton in shock. They didn’t know what was going on. Despite all their knowledge, they had no idea what a representative implied.</p>
<p>However, the brilliance that ignited over the skeleton resembled a god’s descent into the world. The ordinary flag burst into a blinding radiance. It was like a blinding sun.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, I once heard that the six heroes became heroes after obtaining the heritage of powerful creatures. Could it be that there are similar opportunities here?” Lu Yunxian said to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen knew that this place was likely the same as the Holy Temple in the Holy Land. It could inherit the bloodline powers of a race, but the Sigh of the King didn’t give him a good feeling, so he didn’t plan on accepting the offer.</p>
<p>“What race are you from?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to refuse as he asked the skeleton.</p>
<p>This rare chance of seeing the anchor symbol and learning that it belonged to some race made Zhou Wen want to ask the skeleton which race the symbol belonged to.</p>
<p>“Your soul tells me that you’re not willing to become my race’s representative. What a pity… A pity…” As the skeleton spoke, the light on its body and flag faded.</p>
<p>The skeleton slowly sat back on the ground just like in the beginning. It leaned against the vine flag and lowered its head, returning to its lifeless state.</p>
<p>Can you not be so straightforward? Can you at least answer a few of my questions? Zhou Wen felt depressed. The answer was right in front of him, but he couldn’t crack the mystery. He had the urge to agree to the skeleton to get the answer.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>As the skeleton returned to its dead silence, the strange vehicle chugged on again. The puppet moved the crank, causing the strange vehicle to move again.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and company hurriedly jumped onto the strange vehicle. They didn’t know where they were, so they had to rely on the strange vehicle to find their way.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian worried that the strange vehicle would leave the ruins, but it didn’t retreat. It continued to drive deeper into the desert.</p>
<p>The desert wasn’t as big as they imagined. In less than half an hour, it had already driven out of the desert and entered an endless mountain range.</p>
<p>The underground mountains were not very tall. The highest was only a few hundred meters, its peak almost reaching the sapphire sky.</p>
<p>As the strange vehicle entered the mountainous region, Blood Threadworms reappeared. Moreover, there were more than had previously been seen in the tunnel. There were patches of rocks seemingly covered in black blood everywhere. In fact, they were crawling with Blood Threadworms.</p>
<p>When the Blood Threadworms discovered them, they crawled over but the puppet didn’t even need to play the stone musical instrument to scare them from approaching any further. They gathered on both sides of the vehicle like spectators watching a motorcade, parting a path for the strange vehicle to pass.</p>
<p>The terrain on the mountain became more and more complicated. The vehicle even drove into the belly of a mountain. With the changes in the strata, Zhou Wen felt that the vehicle was still moving down.</p>
<p>Lu Ning observed the cliffs and tidal-like Blood Threadworms and said with some hesitation, “I think I have some memory of this place. It’s like I’ve been here before. However, I didn’t pay too much attention to the situation down there since we were walking on the cliff up above, so I can’t be certain.”</p>
<p>Just as she said that, Lu Ning’s eyes lit up and she pointed ahead. “No mistake about it. This is it. This is the valley of the fault before entering the temple. That stone pillar is the path to the stone temple. On the other side is the stone temple.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian looked over and indeed saw a stone pillar on the cliff ahead. The stone pillar wasn’t the same as the stone walls beside it. It was grayish-white and eye-catching. Its shape was angular, making it obvious that it had been carved.</p>
<p>“If this strange vehicle doesn’t stop when we pass by the stone pillar, should we get off? We have to make a choice now,” Lu Yunxian said to Zhou Wen and Lu Ning.</p>
<p>“If we get off here, we can enter the temple directly. We can find the fault that Adjutant An fell into.” Lu Ning obviously agreed to get out of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian looked at Zhou Wen who said after some thought, “Finding An Sheng is more important. Let’s get off here.”</p>
<p>Since their original target was the fault inside the temple, they could get there directly from here. There was no need for them to continue riding the vehicle.</p>
<p>Seeing both of them agree to alight, Lu Yunxian nodded slightly. When he reached the stone pillar, he used flames to open a path, burning the Blood Threadworms on a nearby mountain wall. Then, the three of them climbed up the pillar and soon arrived at the top.</p>
<p>Indeed, they saw a stone temple built against a mountain. It was like half a temple growing from the mountain wall. Zhou Wen saw an anchor sculpture at the top of the temple. The woman with the side profile was carved on the front of the anchor</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have the time to carefully examine the ship’s anchor sculpture because, in front of the stone temple, Lord Alcohol and about a dozen people had summoned all sorts of Companion Beasts. They appeared to be preparing for battle, staring at something beyond the temple doors.</p>
<p>As they didn’t move or make any noise, Zhou Wen and company hadn’t noticed them until they arrived at the top.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and company charged up the stone pillar, Lord Alcohol and company immediately looked in their direction. Instantly, the atmosphere turned tense.</p>
<p>Lu Ning stared at them and said coldly, “Lord Alcohol, you heartless bast*rd. You betrayed and plotted to harm Adjutant An despite all the benefits he gave you. Aren’t you being too ruthless?”</p>
<p>When Lu Ning said that, the expression of Lord Alcohol and company changed drastically as they gaped their mouths, as though they were saying something. However, Zhou Wen wondered if there was something wrong with his ears—he couldn’t hear anything. They kept opening and closing their mouths, and from the shapes of their mouths, it felt like they were repeating two words.</p>
<p>Don’t speak! Zhou Wen lip-read and connected it to the anxious looks written all over the faces of Lord Alcohol and company. He immediately had an ominous feeling as he hurriedly pulled Lu Ning to stop her from speaking</p>
<p>Lu Ning also realized that something was not right. She had long shut her mouth and stopped talking, but she heard a loud rumbling coming from the temple as if it was thunder.</p>
<h3 id='chapter293'>Chapter 293 Echo</h3>
<p>The voice grew louder, as if lightning was approaching rapidly.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the sound came out of the stone temple, it was like a thunderclap exploding above everyone’s heads. Zhou Wen felt his ears buzz as though his head was about to split open. His eyes, nose, ears, and mouth bled. He couldn’t hear anything for a moment.</p>
<p>The other people were in no better situation than Zhou Wen. Some of them had already spewed out blood. Even their Companion Beasts were affected. Their expressions turned ghastly as some of them were clearly injured.</p>
<p>However, Lord Alcohol and company covered their ears and remained motionless.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t dare move when he saw the situation. The sound was odd, but the thunderclap that happened above him nearly knocked him unconscious. Who knew what the consequences would be if he continued talking.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought of retreating to the other side of the stone pillar. If he did, he could shout and use that terrifying sound to easily finish off Lord Alcohol and the rest.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol kept staring at Zhou Wen and company. Seeing the change in Zhou Wen’s eyes, he seemed to have guessed something. He opened his mouth and said something to Zhou Wen, but he didn’t make a sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen carefully tried to lip-read and realized that he was saying: “Don’t move. Airflow can also cause echoes. When that happens, all of us will die. If we could run, we’d have run.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if what he said was true, but seeing how they had no intention to move, he guessed it was true. They would probably have run if they could.</p>
<p>“You can’t stay here forever, right?” Zhou Wen mouthed to Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>“Wait, in another hour, the echo will disappear,” Lord Alcohol said.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he heard that. Since they Lord Alcohol and company didn’t dare to move, they could still maintain peace. However, once the restriction on them disappeared, Zhou Wen and company might not be their match.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Wen had the banana fan, Lord Alcohol and the rest clearly weren’t weaklings. Even a person like An Sheng had been thrown down the fault. This group couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>Especially a person like Lord Alcohol. He had experienced the dimensional storms before. He was even associated with people like Jing Daoxian and Zhang Daotian. He was definitely not as simple as a haggard old man.</p>
<p>If I don’t teach them a lesson now, the three of us will be at a disadvantage later, Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, the three of them weren’t immune to the damage from the echo. Finishing off Lord Alcohol and the rest now was equivalent to dooming themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Truth Listener is still in the midst of its evolution. Otherwise, it would probably have some effect on the echoes. Zhou Wen thought of Truth Listener and looked at the chaos space. It was still in a stone egg form; the completion of its evolution unknown.</p>
<p>Other than Truth Listener, is there no other way? Zhou Wen racked his brains for a way to deal with the echo.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy was definitely not up to the mark. She was an offensive-type Companion Beast, so she didn’t have good defense. Now that they were facing an invisible enemy, it was impossible counterattacking.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Doctor Darkness was even more useless. Without an opponent, his ability could not be used.</p>
<p>Ghost Bride might be of some use. As a ghost, she’s probably not afraid of the sonar attack, Zhou Wen thought. Although Ghost Bride wasn’t afraid of the echo, it wasn’t of much help to Zhou Wen. She couldn’t block the echo for them.</p>
<p>Unless the echo is directional. Zhou Wen carefully recalled the details of the echo blast. He felt that although they were relatively far from the stone temple, they didn’t hold any advantage.</p>
<p>The further they went, the louder the echo. They were no different from Lord Alcohol and the rest who were standing in front of the stone temple.</p>
<p>While Zhou Wen was contemplating the matter, he saw Lu Yunxian wink at him and mouth something to him. However, Zhou Wen had been looking at Lord Alcohol and company, so he hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>Now that he noticed Lu Yunxian, he could tell from his mouth that he seemed to be saying: “I have a way to withstand the echoes.”</p>
<p>“You can withstand the echoes?” Zhou Wen also mouthed in response to Lu Yunxian. Unfortunately, Lu Yunxian didn’t have the ability to read lips. He kept repeating his words.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen thought about it. Lu Yunxian was quite reliable, so it was unlikely he would lie.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before attempting to walk towards Lu Yunxian. He was only two or three steps away when he immediately heard the rumbling of thunder in the stone temple.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A thunderclap boomed, causing Lord Alcohol and company to bleed from their seven orifices. Even the Companion Beasts were no exception.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Wen and company, they were fine. In front of them was a strange pet that looked like a headless pig. Its body was curvy and oval without a head or tail. It had four hooves growing on it. It looked very strange.</p>
<p>However, such a silly-looking Companion Beast had actually used a strange energy fluctuation to withstand the terrifying sonar blast, preventing the trio from being hit by it.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes immediately narrowed as he looked in the direction of Lord Alcohol. The latter wasn’t in a good state to begin with, so when he saw what had happened, his face became even paler.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, how about we make a deal?” Lord Alcohol mouthed a request.</p>
<p>“What kind of deal?” Zhou Wen directly asked, immediately causing thunder to rumble from the stone temple. It turned back into an echo that boomed above the stone temple.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Some of the Companion Beasts dropped to the ground. The dozen or so people bled from their seven orifices. The weaker ones had already collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>These sounds triggered even more echoes. Thunder rumbled outside the stone temple, as if an enraged thunder god kept attacking with echoes.</p>
<p>There were already a few people on Lord Alcohol’s side who were badly bleeding, who knew if they could survive this ordeal. Zhou Wen’s situation wasn’t looking good either. The echo’s powers were too strong, and the strange Companion Beast was trembling. It didn’t seem as if it could last much longer.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s eyes darted askew and saw that, instead of retreating, the old fellow chose to harge into the stone temple in spite of the thunderous booms.</p>
<p>“Let’s enter the stone temple.” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he made Lu Yunxian control the Companion Beast.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen originally imagined that the sound would be even more terrifying when they were nearer the stone temple. However, he realized that the further away he was, the louder the sound was. Although the echo remained terrifying in the stone temple, it wasn’t as terrifying as outside.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sized up the stone hall and saw that there were many crudely-made stone objects inside. Lord Alcohol continued running for the back door of the stone temple. The echoes left him vomiting blood, but were unable to kill him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter294'>Chapter 294 Longevity Fruit</h3>
<p>“Where did An Sheng fall from?” Zhou Wen asked Lu Ning.</p>
<p>“The fault at the back of the temple,” Lu Ning replied.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got Lu Yunxian to control his Companion Beast as the trio rushed into the back hall.</p>
<p>If the front of the temple was considered a building, then the back of the temple was a huge cavern. 80% of it maintained its original appearance with only a few places showing signs of artificial excavation.</p>
<p>A stone drum stood on the left side of the cavern, emitting thumping sounds. The terrifying sonar waves came from it.</p>
<p>However, now that Zhou Wen and company were close to the stone drum, they couldn’t sense the powerful might of the echo. The power of the sonar wave was only equivalent to a Legendary sonar wave attack.</p>
<p>A huge rift spanning a few hundred meters covered the other side of the cave, and at the back was a strange fruit tree.</p>
<p>The fruit tree was twenty to thirty meters tall, its crown resembling a large umbrella. The tree had dense leaves and its body was black as ink. Only the leaves had a few fine white veins.</p>
<p>Many fruits peppered the areas between the black leaves. However, looking carefully, one couldn’t help but be alarmed.</p>
<p>This was because the fruits looked like babies that were sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed. It exuded an indescribable horror.</p>
<p>No matter how he looked at it, Zhou Wen found the strange tree resembled the Dead Man Tree in his mysterious phone, but there were slight differences.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol had already run up to the tree. He leaped up to pick the infant-like fruit.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was an illusion, but he saw the fruit move by itself, taking the initiative to make contact with Lord Alcohol’s palm. Soon, it was in his hand.</p>
<p>“I originally planned on letting them give it a try, but now there’s nothing I can do.” Lord Alcohol’s red eyes stared at the strange fruit that resembled a jade doll and swallowed it.</p>
<p>“What’s that fruit?” Zhou Wen asked Lu Ning.</p>
<p>Lu Ning looked confused. “When we first entered, this was all there was at the back of the temple. There was no stone drum or fruit trees.”</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen pulled out his Bamboo Blade and cleaved at Lord Alcohol, who had just swallowed the fruit, with the Demonic Astral Wheel. Since he had become an archenemy, he had to try with all his might to kill his enemy.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know what changes would happen after Lord Alcohol swallowed the fruit. Although he wanted to know, he wasn’t willing to wait for the outcome.</p>
<p>Lu Ning and Lu Yunxian shared the same thoughts. Two forces of ice and fire joined Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel in the assault on Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>After Lord Alcohol swallowed the fruit, he seemed to be in a daze. He stood there motionless with his head lowered and his body bent. He looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>Just as the three forces were about to hit him, Lord Alcohol raised his head and spread open his arms. He leaned back and let out a painful</p>
<p>roar.</p>
<p>A terrifying power erupted from his body as a powerful shockwave shattered Zhou Wen and company’s attacks. This terrifying power wasn’t directed at the three of them.</p>
<p>Their expressions instantly turned nasty as Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy. Banana Fairy opened her mouth and blew a gust of cold wind at the roaring Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew Lord Alcohol away, slamming him into the stone wall at the back of the cave, creating a huge pit.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s body leaned against the pit in the stone wall, his body twisted. Covered in frost, his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>However, the ominous feeling in Zhou Wen’s heart intensified. With the Bamboo Blade in hand, he used Ghost Steps to instantly appear in front of Lord Alcohol, delivering Transcendent Flying Immortal right into Lord Alcohol’s chest.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lord Alcohol’s hand suddenly moved. The veins on his hand protruded like tiny purple snakes wrapping around his arm. Furthermore, his arm was emitting a strange blood-colored glow.</p>
<p>At such a close distance, Lord Alcohol held the Bamboo Blade that had stabbed at him like a bolt of lightning. It had failed to slice off his palm but had managed to slice it open.</p>
<p>Blood flowed out, but he seemed to feel nothing. Holding the blade, he opened his eyes and slowly stood up from the pit.</p>
<p>As he stood up, his body underwent a tremendous change. His fractured bones automatically healed, and his white hair turned black. His hunched and thin figure also gradually straightened up as he bulked up. His entire silhouette and overall bearing seemed to undergo a miraculous change.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol, who looked like an old man, had turned into a middle-aged man as he slowly stood up. There were no signs of aging on him at all. It was hard to imagine that the previous Lord Alcohol was the same person.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness silently crept behind him and stabbed him in the waist with his scalpel.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Without even looking back, Lord Alcohol threw out his palm, sending Doctor Darkness and his Life Soul flying out. Doctor Darkness slammed into the mountain wall, his bones seemingly fractured. He fell to the ground with a twisted expression. It was unknown if he could survive.</p>
<p>“Jing Daoxian didn’t lie to me. The fruit of the Longevity Tree can really restore one’s youth. It feels great being young…” Lord Alcohol wore a look of delight. In his glee, he exerted strength in his palm, throwing Zhou Wen and his saber flying.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen switched to the Godfiend Life Providence in midair and used its power to counter the terrifying momentum that Lord Alcohol transferred into him. He landed safely on the ground, not suffering a tragic fate like Doctor Darkness.</p>
<p>“What’s that fruit? How did it make Lord Alcohol become so terrifying?” Lu Yunxian said as he looked at the young and powerful Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t look too good. The aura emanating from Lord Alcohol was terrifying. Zhou Wen could even faintly feel an invisible gas rising from his body like an invisible devil.</p>
<p>What made Zhou Wen most worried was that the current Lord Alcohol had already reached an unimaginable level. Even Banana Fairy couldn’t kill him. The three of them probably didn’t have the strength to resist him anymore.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol had transformed into a twenty-year-old youth. His black hair was hanging down due to his nature-defying growth, and his muscles were filled with elasticity and strength. He had been a grizzled old man just moments ago.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave, now.” Zhou Wen cried out to Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning, before turning to run towards the front temple.</p>
<p>Since they were no match for him, death was the only outcome.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol glanced coldly at them and reached out his hand to grab at them. Zhou Wen and company immediately felt an irresistible suction force pulling them towards him.</p>
<h3 id='chapter295'>Chapter 295 Devil</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen held the banana fan and sent out a gust of Grand Yin Wind.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s body was blown away once again and he slammed into the wall. However, he stood up even faster this time and he recovered from his injuries more quickly. He stared at the banana fan in Zhou Wen’s hand with a sharp gaze. “An Epic Companion Beast can’t have such potent wind-elemental powers. That’s a Mythical Companion Beast. Which race do you represent?”</p>
<p>“So you’re also a representative?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“Pfft, I’m not a lackey. I’m myself. I’m a lord no matter where I go, not anyone’s dog. It doesn’t matter which race you represent. You’ll all die today,” Lord Alcohol said as he stared coldly at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>With that said, Lord Alcohol’s majestic figure took a step forward and arrived in front of Zhou Wen. He grabbed his head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body phased away as he spread his wings behind him. His figure flashed like a shadow as he dodged Lord Alcohol’s grasp.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The force exerted by Lord Alcohol’s fingers left five finger marks that were more than a meter long on the mountain wall over a hundred meters away. It alarmed Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning attacked at the same time. Two completely different forces, one ice and one fire, attacked Lord Alcohol’s back.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Yunxian’s flaming tiger and Lu Ning’s Ice Snake’s powers shattered. The two of them were sent flying as they spat out blood and fell into the distance; their outcomes unknown.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen sighed inwardly. Indeed, I should just stay at home and play games. Why did I have to risk my life? But there are some things that I have to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen tightened his grip on the banana fan as Lord Alcohol walked towards him. The only thing that could restrain Lord Alcohol was this banana fan, but the Grand Yin Wind consumed too much Primordial Energy, preventing him from constantly using it. It was a huge weakness.</p>
<p>If Zhou Wen took a step further and advanced to the Epic stage, he might still be able to use his Life Soul to resolve the problem of his Primordial Energy consumption, but he didn’t have a good solution at the moment.</p>
<p>“Lord Alcohol, it looks like I won’t be able to escape death today. Before I die, can you tell me what those fruits are? Why do they have the mystical powers of rejuvenation?” Zhou Wen wanted to stall for time.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol was clearly very excited. He had finally gotten what he wanted after so many years. At that moment, he had a lot of glee and emotions that he wanted to vent.</p>
<p>“This is a Longevity Fruit. Its effect isn’t as simple as rejuvenation, turning one young again. In the words used in ancient times, consuming this fruit can allow one to ascend and transform.” Lord Alcohol’s face was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>“I heard you say that Jing Daoxian told you about the Longevity Tree?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Jing Daoxian, Zhang Daotian, and I were playmates who grew up together. However, I wasn’t as blessed as Zhang Daotian or as talented as Jing Daoxian. Neither was my luck comparable to theirs. Thankfully, I’ve had a relatively good life and managed to live to old age.”</p>
<p>“I met Jing Daoxian a few months ago. Jing Daoxian had white hair and looked older than the past you. If the Longevity Fruit was really that good without any side effects, why didn’t he pluck one and eat it himself, so as to restore his youth?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve naturally thought of this question. I wanted those fellows to test it out, but unfortunately, you ruined my plans. But now, it looks like Jing Daoxian didn’t lie to me. He probably feels that it’s beneath him to use the Longevity Fruit.”</p>
<p>“Lord Alcohol, isn’t what you just said a little too naive? You’ve lived to this age. Just think about it. Who wouldn’t want to stay youthful forever?” Zhou Wen retorted.</p>
<p>However, Lord Alcohol sneered. “It’s naturally impossible for anyone else, but Jing Daoxian is different. He’s a natural devil. Common sense doesn’t apply to him. Things that people spend their whole lives pursuing is nothing to him. If he puts his mind to it, he can obtain anything.”</p>
<p>Seeing how Lord Alcohol seemed to think highly of Jing Daoxian, Zhou Wen deliberately retorted, “No matter how powerful Jing Daoxian is, didn’t he still lose to the Hero King, Zhang Daotian? Isn’t the claim that he can obtain anything a little too devoid of reality?”</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol immediately revealed a look of disdain. “Zhang Daotian may be a stunning genius, but he’s still much worse than Jing Daoxian. Everyone thinks that Zhang Daotian defeated Jing Daoxian, but unbeknownst to them, the only time Zhang Daotian beat Jing Daoxian was in his marriage to Wan Yiqi.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious, and not purely because he was just trying to stall for time.</p>
<p>“Back then, Jing Daoxian and Zhang Daotian fell in love with Wan Yiqi, but because Jing Daoxian was extremely tyrannical and malicious as he acted according to his whims, he gradually gained the title of a devil. As for Zhang Daotian, he became the Hero King. It’s also why Wan Yiqi eventually chose Zhang Daotian who represented justice and kindness. What a pity that she never expected…” At this point, Lord Alcohol sneered.</p>
<p>“What didn’t she expect?” Zhou Wen pressed.</p>
<p>“She never expected that she herself was the stumbling block of justice,” Lord Alcohol mocked. “On the second day after Wan Yiqi and Zhang Daotian got engaged, Wan Yiqi advanced to the Epic stage and obtained her Life Soul. Guess what its name was?”</p>
<p>“What was it?” Zhou Wen knew that Lord Alcohol just wanted someone to respond to his words.</p>
<p>“Haha, her Life Soul was actually the Culling Empress. If Wan Yiqi wanted to live, she had to kill someone every day to rear Culling Empress; otherwise, Culling Empress would turn itself against her. And as time went by, Culling Empress would become stronger, forcing her to take more lives. Hence, she passively became the most evil devil in the world. Regardless of her willingness, she had become a stumbling block of justice, becoming the person she hated the most.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t killing dimensional creatures work?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“No, she could only kill humans. That was what the Culling Empress demanded. Wan Yiqi told Zhang Daotian about her Life Soul, imagining that he could help her. Unfortunately, no one can change their Life Souls. Wan Yiqi still committed murder under the influence of Culling Empress, and Zhang Daotian chose to let her be punished by the League’s laws.”</p>
<p>“There’s such a thing? Why haven’t I heard of it before?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.</p>
<p>“You obviously won’t read about it in the history books. When Wan Yiqi was about to be sentenced to death, Jing Daoxian stormed the League building and slaughtered almost everyone, producing a river of blood. Only a few survived. By the time Zhang Daotian arrived, he saw corpses everywhere, while Wan Yiqi stood there completely unharmed. On the snow-white wall behind her were words written in blood.”</p>
<p>The League shall live with her alive. The League shall perish with her dead.</p>
<h3 id='chapter296'>Chapter 296 Begging for Mercy</h3>
<p>“For the sake of pride, the League could only say that Zhang Daotian had sent Jing Daoxian scurrying. In fact, it wasn’t too far from the truth. In that battle, Jing Daoxian really suffered severe injuries. It would be hard to say who would have won if they had fought. Since then, the League has been trying all means to have Jing Daoxian killed. They tried all kinds of despicable means, but even so, they failed to kill him,” Lord Alcohol said.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t Jing Daoxian take Wan Yiqi away? Why did he leave her there?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what others would choose, but with Jing Daoxian’s pride, he definitely wouldn’t take her away no matter what happened since she hadn’t chosen him in the past.”</p>
<p>“What a strange person. Did Zhang Daotian kill Wan Yiqi in the end?” Zhou Wen had already forgotten that he was stalling for time. He couldn’t help but ask again after being completely attracted by the story.</p>
<p>“Who would dare to kill Wan Yiqi if Jing Daoxian was alive? Back then, Jing Daoxian really had the ability to slaughter Congress.” Lord Alcohol shot Zhou Wen a look and said, “Don’t ask me how Wan Yiqi survived. I have no idea either. There are so many people in the League, so there’s always a way to deal with the problem regarding Wan Yiqi’s Life Soul. But ever since then, Wan Yiqi has never appeared in public.”</p>
<p>“Alright, now that the story is over, you should be on your way. Life is seeping away from you, but you are still able to listen to the stories of others with such relish. You’re an interesting person. If you weren’t a representative, I could have spared your life. Pity,” Lord Alcohol said as he walked towards Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I said I’m not a representative?” Zhou Wen asked.</p>
<p>“How can one have a Mythical Companion Beast without being a representative?” Lord Alcohol said disdainfully as he curled his lips.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen naturally knew what his situation was, but he couldn’t think of a good solution. In front of the disparity in strength, it was difficult for him to think of a plan to defy the heavens and change fate.</p>
<p>The only more reliable method was probably to pluck a fruit from the tree, like Lord Alcohol, and eat it. Perhaps he could become as strong as him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen felt that there was something sinister about the Longevity Fruit. He hadn’t eaten it, afraid that there would be side effects.</p>
<p>Besides, even if Zhou Wen wanted to eat it, Lord Alcohol wasn’t blind. How could he give him such a chance?</p>
<p>“I can only give it a try.” Zhou Wen tightened his grip on the Bamboo Blade, and with Demonic Astral Wheel, he slashed at Lord Alcohol once again.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s fingers pressed on the Demonic Astral Wheel. The spinning blade arc was stopped by his fingers and with a loud bang, it dissipated into light wisps.</p>
<p>Banana Fairy blew a gust of Grand Yin Wind, and almost simultaneously, Zhou Wen used Ghost Steps and seemingly teleported to the Longevity Tree.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol suddenly vanished, avoiding the Grand Yin Wind as well as sending a palm strike down at Zhou Wen. He was actually able to keep up with the speed of Ghost Steps.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and Godfiend Life Providence’s powers to reduce the force, but it remained too powerful. He slammed into the mountain wall and cracked it, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>What a waste. This amount of blood is enough for me to play several rounds of games. Zhou Wen knew he had no choice but to risk his life. He gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly and activated the Sigh of the King.</p>
<p>The saber beam streaked across the void like lightning. Saber flashes intercrossed on Lord Alcohol’s body, and augmented by the mighty power of the Sigh of the King, Zhou Wen pushed the Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits.</p>
<p>However, all he heard was the sound of metal clashing. Lord Alcohol blocked all his Transcendent Flying Immortal attacks with his finger acting as a sword.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen failed to injure Lord Alcohol despite delivering Transcendent Flying Immortal. He gritted his teeth and made a second attempt with Transcendent Flying Immortal, but halfway through, he was struck in the chest by a sword beam which sent him flying backward.</p>
<p>After crashing to the ground, Zhou Wen struggled to sit up. The wound on his chest continued to bleed. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had dodged two centimeters at the critical moment, the sword beam would have pierced through his heart.</p>
<p>“You’re really not bad. Back when Jing Daoxian was your age, he wasn’t as powerful as you. However, the better you are, the more reason there is for you to die,” Lord Alcohol said as he raised his palm again, as though he was about to execute Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and took out something from the chaos space. It was the small metal box with Wang Mingyuan’s note on it. Although he had no idea if it would be effective against a terrifying existence like Lord Alcohol, he had to try given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Teacher, please bless me! Seeing that Lord Alcohol was about to reach him, Zhou Wen took out the slip of paper and opened it. He aimed the words “kneel and beg for mercy” at Lord Alcohol.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s body swayed for a moment as his knees bent slightly. However, before Zhou Wen could rejoice, Lord Alcohol straightened his legs again. He didn’t kneel down.</p>
<p>It’s over. Even Teacher’s item doesn’t work. Zhou Wen’s heart chilled. He knew that he was doomed this time.</p>
<p>“Just those few words can suppress the power of a peak Epic. Who wrote this? Zhang Daotian? No, his words aren’t like that. Besides him, who else in the League possesses such power?” Lord Alcohol looked at the words and couldn’t help but sneer. “Regardless of who you are, you aren’t qualified to use those words on me. Lord Alcohol is forever a lord.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he struck his palm out, sending Zhou Wen and the paper flying.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at WuxiaWorld.Site Only</p>
<p>Zhou Wen slammed into the stone wall once again, creating a huge pit. Many of the bones in his body fractured, and his organs were burning with pain. Now, he and Lord Alcohol had swapped spots.</p>
<p>The piece of white paper didn’t tear as it floated to Zhou Wen’s side.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there’s really no hope this time. Zhou Wen looked at the words on the piece of paper, but he realized that there were another few more words on the piece of paper.</p>
<p>These words were much smaller than the original words, but no matter how small they were, it was impossible that he had only seen them now. It was as if they had appeared out of thin air. Besides the small font, they were still in Wang Mingyuan’s handwriting. The writing style wasn’t something others could mimic.</p>
<p>“My dear disciple… Kneel and beg for mercy…” Zhou Wen read the first three words together with the original words and his expression changed.</p>
<p>Teacher, are you kidding me? What’s the point of me kneeling down and begging for mercy now? People like Lord Alcohol won’t let me off just because I beg for mercy, right? Zhou Wen thought this, but he felt that the reason for Wang Mingyuan’s suggestion went deeper. It was impossible for him to make him do something for no reason.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lord Alcohol was approaching again, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and prepared to try out Wang Mingyuan’s method to see if it would help him survive.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen forced himself to stand up and as he prepared to genuflect, said, “Spare me…”</p>
<h3 id='chapter297'>Chapter 297 Rescued</h3>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen’s legs bent, he suddenly felt a violent rage erupt from his body like a volcano. Following that, a terrifying power erupted, instantly making Zhou Wen’s legs straighten.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Lord Alcohol was about to say something in a mocking tone when his expression abruptly changed. All his strength erupted as he slammed his palms forward.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s body flew into the air and he remained suspended in midair. His hair stood up as his entire body emitted a demonic and tyrannical halo. When the halo blasted out, Lord Alcohol used both his hands to defend, but his powerful strength from the Longevity Tree was instantly destroyed. His body flew away like a runaway kite.</p>
<p>Seeing Lord Alcohol collapse to the ground and struggling to get up, Zhou Wen wore a look of disbelief. He almost couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t, the Sigh of the King doesn’t need my body as a medium for activation? Zhou Wen finally reacted. The eruption of the Sigh of the King’s power didn’t pass through his body, but directly blasted out.</p>
<p>When Zhou Wen first used the Sigh of the King, he felt as though he was holding a heavy saber and needed to swing it with all his strength. However, when the Sigh of the King erupted this time, it was as though he was using a revolver. Pulling the trigger was enough to release the might. He didn’t need to use his own strength or have his body withstand that formidable force.</p>
<p>“Impossible… Such strength… already doesn’t belong to the Epic stage…” Lord Alcohol struggled to stand up as he glared at Zhou Wen intently as though he was looking at a monster.</p>
<p>However, his current situation wasn’t much better than Zhou Wen’s. He was staggering as he walked, and he didn’t have the ability to fight anymore.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was severely injured, and with the damage to his body caused by the Sigh of the King, he couldn’t even stand up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have Banana Fairy. Zhou Wen ordered Banana Fairy to attack Lord Alcohol, and she immediately flew towards him.</p>
<p>Lord Alcohol’s expression changed slightly as he forcefully gathered his strength and charged towards the Longevity Tree. He wanted to climb up the tree and pluck another Longevity Fruit.</p>
<p>However, just as he touched the Longevity Tree, he saw tree roots that were like poisonous dragons rising from the tree and wrapping around his body. The tip of the tree’s roots stabbed into his body, sucking him dry in an instant.</p>
<p>“Save…” Lord Alcohol widened his eyes in horror as he extended his hand with great difficulty. He wanted to cry for help, but just as he said the first syllable, he was pulled down into the ground by the roots and disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his back, and he was even more certain that the Longevity Tree wasn’t a benevolent entity.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Wen saw a white flower bloom on the tree. The flower bloomed quickly and wilted equally quickly. It formed a fruit that resembled a baby that sat cross-legged. It emitted a refreshing and charming fragrance.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen stared at the fruit in a daze. For some reason, he felt disgusted and nauseous.</p>
<p>As the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra kept healing Zhou Wen’s injured body, he summoned an ordinary Golden Warrior and made the Golden Warrior carry him to Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning to check on their injuries. Although they had suffered quite serious injuries, they weren’t dead. They were just unconscious.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t have the ability to heal themselves. With such severe injuries, it would be very difficult for them to survive if they were not treated quickly—they could die at any moment.</p>
<p>Doctor Darkness’s injuries are also very serious. Furthermore, even if he isn’t injured, that fellow can only use Fight Poison With Poison. He doesn’t know how to rescue people with medical skills. Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a way to rescue them.</p>
<p>Just as he sighed, he heard rustling sounds coming from the direction of the tree. Zhou Wen immediately cursed under his breath, knowing that something wasn’t right. He turned his head and saw tree roots drilling out like strange snakes. They began sweeping towards him.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Demonized General and the Saber Shield Knight, letting each of them carry Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning to run to the front of the temple.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen himself sat on the White Shadow of Poison’s back and allowed it to fly him out.</p>
<p>However, before they could run out, the tree roots had climbed up to the exit of the temple at the back. They were like interweaving spider webs that sealed the exit.</p>
<p>I’m doomed… I wonder if kneeling down is of any use now? Zhou Wen knew that the situation was bad. Seeing the roots sweep over, he could only grit his teeth and rush towards the fault.</p>
<p>There was a patch of dark red below the fault. There were Blood Threadworms everywhere, but Zhou Wen didn’t have a choice. He jumped down, along with Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning.</p>
<p>Reaching the fault, the tree root became apprehensive and stopped chasing after them.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen and company landed, he had to rely on his Companion Beasts to kill the hordes of Blood Threadworms. However, there were too many of them. The three of them weren’t combat-ready as two of them were still unconscious. A few Blood Threadworms had already crawled onto Lu Yunxian’s and Lu Ning’s bodies.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Wen started to feel helpless, he heard a familiar sound.</p>
<p>The strange vehicle… It came all the way here… Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly controlled his Companion Beasts to fight the Blood Threadworms. As long as he lasted until the strange vehicle arrived, the three of them would be saved.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it didn’t take long before the strange vehicle drove out of a cave. Zhou Wen looked at it and was surprised to find that there was another person on it.</p>
<p>“Young Master Wen, why are you here? Didn’t I ask Lu Yunxian to look after you and forbid you from entering the ancient battlefield?” The person on the vehicle surprisingly was An Sheng.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about this for now. Get Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning into the vehicle first. They’re about to die.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to answer An Sheng’s question.</p>
<p>An Sheng jumped out of the strange vehicle and Zhou Wen saw that his clothes were neat and his hair wasn’t messy at all. It was obviously not as tragic as Lu Ning imagined.</p>
<p>An Sheng carried Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning into the vehicle while Zhou Wen jumped in. He sat in the vehicle, panting.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you not to enter? Why are you here?” An Sheng said as he looked at Zhou Wen with a reproachful look.</p>
<p>“Do you think I wanted to come? If it wasn’t because of that darn stone artifact I needed to pass to you, I wouldn’t have come to such a wretched place.” Zhou Wen recounted the situation.</p>
<p>After An Sheng heard that, he said in surprise, “The stone artifact is actually on you. Well done. Give it to me. Without it, I won’t be able to open the ancient divine temple to save Madam.”</p>
<p>“Well… The stone artifact is with me, but there’s just this tiny problem,” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you lost the stone artifact?” An Sheng asked Zhou Wen.</p>
<h3 id='chapter298'>Chapter 298 Dragon Pearl</h3>
<p>“It’s not that I lost it, but one of my Companion Beasts has eaten it. It has now transformed into a stone egg and is evolving.” Zhou Wen took out Truth Listener’s stone egg. “I wonder if this can be used as a substitute?”</p>
<p>“That… I don’t know… Let’s give it a try…” An Sheng wasn’t sure either. After some thought, he said, “Give me the stone egg and take this chariot out. It will take you all the way out of the ruins without bringing much danger. The injuries on Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning need treatment. There aren’t any healing Companion Beasts here.”</p>
<p>“Were you the one who sent Lu Ning out?” Zhou Wen handed the stone egg to An Sheng as he asked.</p>
<p>“The Blood Threadworms in her body weren’t easy to deal with, so I had no choice but to send her out first,” An Sheng said as he took the stone egg.</p>
<p>“What’s going on with you, Lord Alcohol and the others?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that An Sheng would be so careless as to bring a group of people with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that we were making use of each other. Lord Alcohol had his ploy, and I also needed someone to attract the attention of the Longevity Tree in the Longevity Hall.” An Sheng carefully put away the stone egg.</p>
<p>“Have Sis Lan and the former principal been found? Are they alright?” Zhou Wen asked the question he wanted to know the most.</p>
<p>“They should be inside the temple. However, with the stone artifact missing, the temple couldn’t be opened. If there are no mishaps, I should be able to rescue them. Head back now. Let’s talk when I’m back.” An Sheng said as he jumped out of the strange vehicle, heading towards the cave where the strange vehicle had come from. In a blink of an eye, he vanished.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and leaned against the back of the chariot’s hold. He felt his body aching terribly.</p>
<p>If I knew I could meet Ah Sheng by riding the chariot all the way to the temple, I wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble. I almost died. Zhou Wen looked at Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning. They were in terrible conditions, and he had no idea if they could survive the journey back to the encampment.</p>
<p>On the chariot’s return trip, the route it took was identical to the previous one. After passing through the desert and sea, the chariot drove out of the ruins’ underground tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen took Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning back to the camp. Zhao Xin treated their wounds and managed to keep them alive. The Blood Threadworms that had entered their bodies were not fatal, but he was unable to rid the Blood Threadworms for them as Doctor Darkness was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s injuries were also very serious, but the energies of the Ivy Companion Beast were limited. He got Zhao Xin to take care of Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning first while he slowly recovered using the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.</p>
<p>He laid in bed and grinded the bat cave instance dungeon once again. Although the bat cave’s drop rate wasn’t high, it had many bats, allowing for quite a number of items to drop. However, none of them were good.</p>
<p>When can I have a baby tiger drop? If I take it to the bat cave, I’ll definitely enjoy a much bigger harvest. Zhou Wen didn’t manage to obtain a baby tiger the entire time, so he was extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the underground sea again, Zhou Wen carefully looked at the sapphire sky but didn’t discover anything inside.</p>
<p>Why isn’t there the chariot in-game? With no way to travel by air, Zhou Wen had no choice but to travel over the surface of the sea. He flew one White Shadow of Poison at low altitudes, not daring to fly too high.</p>
<p>After flying for a short while, the seawater sprayed out as an obsidian-like sea dragon tore out from the sea’s surface. It opened its mouth in a bid to swallow Zhou Wen and White Shadow of Poison.</p>
<p>Its mouth seemed to be a black hole with a terrifying suction force, sucking the White Shadow of Poison. It had no ability to resist at all and couldn’t even escape.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen hurriedly got White Shadow of Poison to use its Shadow of Darkness skill. It was effective, turning both itself and the blood-colored avatar into a shadow. Then, sneaking away, they escaped the dragon’s jaws.</p>
<p>But very quickly, a few heads of the black dragon popped out from different directions and sucked at White Shadow of Poison.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s heart was unperturbed as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to jump down from White Shadow of Poison’s back using Ghost Steps as he plunged into the sea.</p>
<p>The dragon heads bit White Shadow of Poison, practically dooming it. After the blood-colored avatar jumped into the sea, Zhou Wen controlled him to rapidly dive down as he looked at the body of the sea dragons.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had previously seen them twice and realized that their bodies were connected together under the sea. Now that there was a chance, he naturally had to take a closer look.</p>
<p>He was astonished to discover that it wasn’t a nine-headed dragon. The nine black dragons’ bodies beneath the sea were actually chained together.</p>
<p>Black chains pierced through their spines, connecting their bodies to a black war wagon. The war wagon looked like it was made of metal, and was completely sealed with four walls with a ceiling. It was impossible to see what was inside.</p>
<p>When the nine black dragons moved, they would pull the huge metal war wagon slowly. Therefore, the speed of these black dragons was greatly restricted. Otherwise, they would have traveled even faster.</p>
<p>Who has the right to sit on a war wagon pulled by the nine black dragons? Zhou Wen didn’t know if there were any creatures inside the war wagon. If there were, it would be extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>However, looking at the war wagon, it seemed to have been abandoned for a long time. Seaweed wrapped around it, with seashells and coral taking root on the war wagon, making it look very strange.</p>
<p>Wait… What’s that? Zhou Wen’s gaze landed on the corals on the war wagon, and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Among the coral, there was an obsidian-like pearl wrapped in seaweed. Zhou Wen suspected that the pearl was a dragon pearl as spoken in legend. It could also be an egg of a dragon.</p>
<p>If I can get that dragon pearl, I wonder if I can borrow its power to raise my last stat to 21 points? Just as Zhou Wen thought of this, the game screen turned black.</p>
<p>A black dragon had devoured the blood-colored avatar, ending Zhou Wen’s game.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen wasn’t depressed. On the contrary, he was extremely excited. He seemed to see the hope at advancing to the Epic stage.</p>
<p>The black dragons were very likely Mythical creatures, and the dragon pearl in the corals might be their descendant. Consuming one would likely be a good substitute for the divine blood.</p>
<p>More importantly, the nine black dragons were chained and connected to the black war wagon. The war wagon’s weight greatly affected the nine black dragons’ mobility. This gave Zhou Wen a chance to steal the dragon pearl or he wouldn’t survive in front of these Mythical creatures.</p>
<p>How can I obtain that dragon pearl? Zhou Wen kept the question on his mind.</p>
<p>Although he found it promising, Zhou Wen failed to approach the war wagon the next few times he tried before being devoured by the black dragons.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I have to come up with a detailed plan. I wonder if kneeling will be of any use… Zhou Wen thought to himself.</p>
<h3 id='chapter299'>Chapter 299 Missing</h3>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t know if kneeling down was of any use in real life, but it proved useless in-game. Don’t ask Zhou Wen how he knew. It would only bring him to tears.</p>
<p>After a few days of grinding in the camp, he had failed to obtain the Dragon Pearl. He did manage to kill plenty of poisonous bats and he managed to raise his Poison stat to 15. A few poisonous bat Companion Eggs dropped, but their stats were far inferior to the White Shadow of Poison. They were all fed to his pets as food.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, An Sheng brought Ouyang Lan and a few others back. Zhou Wen had an ominous feeling when he saw that the former principal wasn’t among them.</p>
<p>“Sis Lan.” Zhou Wen went forward to ask about the former principal.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan looked a little tired as she forced a smile and said, “Little Wen, An Sheng told me of the tremendous help you provided him. However, don’t take such risks again. This is beyond your abilities. Luck won’t stand on your side forever.”</p>
<p>“Got it, Sis Lan. Where’s the former principal?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan’s expression fell. “I couldn’t find him. We found some things that belonged to my father and the other experts in the temple, but we couldn’t find any traces of them.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that the former principal hadn’t been found, Zhou Wen’s mood improved ironically-not finding them meant that there was still hope. Hence, Zhou Wen asked, “Could they be trapped somewhere else?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. It’s easy to enter the temple but it’s hard to get out. The people inside can’t come out without someone opening it from the outside. My dad and the rest have clearly ventured deep inside the temple. It’s unlikely they can come out without any rescue,” Ouyang Lan said as she shook her head.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was stunned when he heard that. He was about to ask something when An Sheng said, “Madam didn’t manage to rest while inside. Let her rest.”</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to swallow the words he was about to say. He planned on asking An Sheng later.</p>
<p>Everyone returned to the encampment. Without waiting for Zhou Wen to visit him, An Sheng went to Zhou Wen’s tent and explained the situation inside.</p>
<p>Ouyang Lan and An Sheng had followed the markings left by the former principal and found the temple. They did not find any markings left behind by the former principal elsewhere. They could confirm that he had been inside the temple but they could not find him, despite searching the entire area for him.</p>
<p>The former principal’s last marking was on an altar. It meant that something had happened after they arrived. However, it was already the inner sanctum of the temple and there was no other way out, nor did they find any mechanism that made people disappear. The former principal and the others appeared to have disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>After Zhou Wen heard that, he frowned and didn’t say a word. There must be a problem with the temple, but it wouldn’t be of any use even if he were to go, considering how An Sheng and Ouyang Lan had failed to find any clues, despite being such knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we’ve already explored a portion of the battlefield ruin’s interior. With the chariot, it’s safe when heading to the temple. We’ll get professionals to investigate and seek out every possibility.” An Sheng paused and added, “But based on the present circumstances, trying to find Old Mister Ouyang won’t take a day or two. Madam wants you to return to school and stop wasting time here.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll head back. But before I leave, can you take me to the temple? I want to take a look too.” Although he knew that there was no point in going, Zhou Wen refused to give up unless he managed to see it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>An Sheng seemed to have guessed that Zhou Wen would have such a request, so he nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The route to the temple was indeed very safe. The chariot was a direct route to the temple, and it would automatically stop when it reached it. It would only be sent to the entrance if someone activated it.</p>
<p>An Sheng led Zhou Wen into the temple. Since he had already figured out the dangers inside, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any danger when An Sheng took him in, until he arrived at the innermost sanctum of the temple.</p>
<p>An Sheng showed him the former principal’s markings. Zhou Wen looked around the temple for a long time but didn’t find any clues.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t accept this result, Zhou Wen had no choice but to return. There was no point in staying there. He could use his phone to continue exploring the temple when he returned. Perhaps he could find some clues.</p>
<p>However, the chariot didn’t exist in the game, so if Zhou Wen wanted to reach the temple, he had to pass through the underground sea first. This was also a problem.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen guessed that the chariot in-game was most likely parked in front of the temple. As no one had activated it, it didn’t appear at the entrance.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the chariot’s purpose was to send people out and not bring them in.</p>
<p>An Sheng sent someone to take Zhou Wen back to Luoyang. After Zhou Wen returned to school, he felt a sense of familiarity. He hadn’t left for many days, but he felt uncomfortable. Perhaps the great contrast between the safe days at school and the dangerous days in the Zhuolu battlefield had gotten to him.</p>
<p>The most pressing matter at hand is to quickly advance to the Epic stage. Otherwise, if something were to happen, it would be difficult to handle it with my lack of strength. Zhou Wen thought about how he could obtain the Dragon Pearl.</p>
<p>Aerial movement techniques like Dragon Gate Fairy Skill were less effective underwater. The water resistance also weakened Ghost Steps. Therefore, the fact that the Dragon Pearl was underwater left Zhou Wen vexed.</p>
<p>Unable to think of a good solution, Zhou Wen went to Wang Mingyuan’s place. Since he knew that Wang Mingyuan loved drinking tea, he even got An Sheng to buy him some high-quality tea that he obviously paid for himself.</p>
<p>“Teacher, this piece of paper was a life-saver. But I tried it again and it doesn’t work anymore, why is that so?” Zhou Wen took out the paper slip and respectfully returned it to Wang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>He later tested it a few more times and discovered that ever since the slip of paper had been used on Lord Alcohol, it had no effect on other dimensional creatures. It was just like an ordinary piece of paper.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen a bowl of rice that can’t be finished no matter what?” Wang Mingyuan asked with a smile as he took back the note.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen immediately understood that the power on the note had been exhausted.</p>
<p>“Teacher, how did you know that my Life Providence would react if I knelt down to beg for mercy?” Zhou Wen voiced out his doubts again. He had never told Wang Mingyuan what his Life Providence was.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan smiled and said, “My research includes the reading of people, and you can say I have some success in it. Therefore, I was able to figure out something about your Life Providence. There’s some pride in your Life Providence, something I’ve never seen before. I knew it was extraordinary, and it wouldn’t tolerate such humiliation, so it might have been of some use. That’s why I got you to test it out to see if it worked. From the looks of it, it really did.”</p>
<p>“Test it out…” Zhou Wen was instantly rendered speechless.</p>
<p>“Then can I still use this move in the future?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked. Since this move was so useful, and there was no real need for him to kneel, it was a waste not to use it.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of the saying that one would rather die than be humiliated? A single instance might make your Life Providence erupt due to anger, but I’m afraid a repeat of that will cause that anger to be vented on you. I’m not sure if you can withstand that. If it’s possible, you can test it out,” Wang Mingyuan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shudder when he thought of Lord Alcohol’s outcome. He quickly replied in all seriousness, “A man should have dignity and not kneel. I’ve never considered it and was just asking.”</p>
